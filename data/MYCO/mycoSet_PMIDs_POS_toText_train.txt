D003160 D016428 D013485 	Two GH10 endo-xylanases from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 with and without cellulose binding module act differently towards soluble and insoluble xylans.	Xylanases are mostly classified as belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 and 11, which differ in catalytic properties and structures. However, within one family, differences may also be present. The influence of solubility and molecular structure of substrates towards the efficiency of two GH10 xylanases from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 was investigated. The xylanases differed in degradation of high and low substituted substrate and the substitution pattern was an important factor influencing their efficiency. Alkali-labile interactions, as well as the presence of cellulose within the complex cell wall structure hindered efficient hydrolysis for both xylanases. The presence of a carbohydrate binding module did not enhance the degradation of the substrates. The differences in degradation could be related to the protein structure of the two xylanases. The study shows that the classification of enzymes does not predict their performance towards various substrates. 
19202090	20090210	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and heterologous expression of a novel ligninolytic peroxidase gene from poroid brown-rot fungus Antrodia cinnamomea.	A novel ligninolytic peroxidase gene (ACLnP) was cloned and characterized from a poroid brown-rot fungus, Antrodia cinnamomea. The genomic DNA of the fungus harboured two copies of ACLnP, with a length of 2111 bp, interlaced with 12 introns, while the full-length cDNA was 1183 bp, with a 66 bp signal peptide and an ORF of 990 bp. The three-dimensional molecular structure model was comparable to that of the versatile peroxidase of Pleurotus eryngii. ACLnP was cloned into vector pQE31, successfully expressed in Escherichia coli strain M15 under the control of the T5 promoter and produced a non-glycosylated protein of about 38 kDa, pI 5.42. The native and recombinant ACLnP was capable of oxidizing the redox mediator veratryl alcohol, and also decolorized bromophenol blue and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol dyes, implicating a functional extracellular peroxidase activity. The significance of discovering a functional ACLnP gene in A. cinnamomea in terms of wood degradation and colonization capacity in its unique niche is discussed. 
12147340	20020731	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 	A family 11 xylanase from Penicillium funiculosum is strongly inhibited by three wheat xylanase inhibitors.	Steady-state kinetic approaches were used to investigate the binding of a novel Penicillium funiculosum xylanase, XYNC, with three known xylanase inhibitor proteins from wheat (Triticum aestivum). The xylanase gene (xynC) was cloned from a P. funiculosum genomic library and the deduced amino acid sequence of XYNC exhibited high sequence similarity with fungal family 11 xylanases. xynC was overexpressed in P. funiculosum and the product (XYNC: M(r)=23.6 kDa; pI=3.7) purified and shown to efficiently degrade birchwood xylan [K(m)=0.47% w/v, Vmax=2540 micromol xylose min(-1) (mg protein)(-1) at pH 5.5 and 30 degrees C] and soluble wheat arabinoxylans [K(m)=1.45% w/v, Vmax=7190 micromol xylose min(-1) mg protein)(-1) at pH 5.5 and 30 degrees C]. The xylanase activity of XYNC was inhibited strongly by three xylanase inhibitor proteins from wheat; XIP-I, TAXI I and TAXI II. The inhibition for each was competitive, with very tight binding (K(i)=3.4, 16 and 17 nM, respectively) equivalent to free energy changes (deltaG degrees ) of -49, -45 and -45 kJ mol(-1). This is the first report describing a xylanase that is inhibited by all three wheat xylanase inhibitor proteins described to date.

To express the cbhI gene, encoding Aspergillus aculeatus cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI), in Aspergillus oryzae, a plasmid was constructed.

It was confirmed by a PCR method that the plasmid was integrated at the niaD locus. 
20680265	20100804	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of endo-1,3-1,4-β-glucanases in GH family 12 from Magnaporthe oryzae.	We have cloned three putative endoglucanase cDNAs, designated MoCel12A, MoCel12B, and MoCel12C, from Magnaporthe oryzae. The deduced peptide sequences of both MoCel12A and MoCel12B contain secretion signal peptides and a catalytic core domain that classify them into GH subfamily 12-1. In contrast, the deduced peptide sequence of MoCel12C consists of a signal peptide, a catalytic core domain, and a fungal-type carbohydrate binding module belonging to GH subfamily 12-2. Although most GH family 12 endoglucanases hydrolyze β-1,4-glucans such as carboxymethylcellulose or phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose, MoCel12A that was prepared by overexpression in M. oryzae and Brevibacillus choshinensis hydrolyzed specifically 1,3-1,4-β-glucans, such as barley β-glucan and lichenan. The specific activity of MoCel12A overexpressed in M. oryzae was about 20 times higher than that prepared from B. choshinensis. Furthermore, MoCel12B prepared by overexpression in B. choshinensis also revealed preferential hydrolysis of endo-1,3-1,4-β-glucans with limited hydrolysis on carboxymethylcellulose. In comparison with MoCel12A, the activity of MoCel12B was more stable under alkaline conditions. Levels of mRNA encoding MoCel12A were constitutively high during infection and spore formation. The overexpression and disruption of the MoCel12A gene did not affect germination, appressorium formation, or invasion rate; however, M. oryzae overexpressing MoCel12A produced larger numbers of spores than the wild type or a mutant in which the MoCel12A gene was disrupted. These results suggest that MoCel12A functions in part to hydrolyze 1,3-1,4-β-glucan during infection and spore formation. 
16844780	20060718	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Development and application of a suite of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes for analyzing plant cell walls.	To facilitate analysis of plant cell wall polysaccharide structure and composition, we cloned 74 genes encoding polysaccharide-degrading enzymes from Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Neurospora crassa and expressed the genes as secreted proteins with C-terminal Myc and 6x His tags. Most of the recombinant enzymes were active in enzyme assays, and optima for pH and temperature were established. A subset of the enzymes was used to fragment polysaccharides from the irregular xylem 9 (irx9) mutant of Arabidopsis. The analysis revealed a decrease in the abundance of xylan in the mutant, indicating that the IRX9 gene, which encodes a putative family 43 glycosyltransferase, is required for xylan synthesis. 
7574590	19950201	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D003160 D016428 	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding a cell-bound, extracellular beta-glucosidase in the yeast Candida wickerhamii.	The ability of yeasts to ferment cellodextrins is rare. Candida wickerhamii is able to use these sugars for alcohol production because of a cell-bound, extracellular, beta-glucosidase that is unusual by not being inhibited by glucose. A cDNA expression library in lambda phage was prepared with mRNA isolated from cellobiose-grown C. wickerhamii. Immunological screening of the library with polyclonal antibodies against purified C. wickerhamii cell-bound, extracellular beta-glucosidase yielded 12 positive clones. Restriction endonuclease analysis and sequence data revealed that the clones could be divided into two groups, bglA and bglB, which were shown to be genetically distinct by Southern hybridization analyses. Efforts were directed at the study of bglB since it appeared to code for the cell-bound beta-glucosidase. Sequence data from both cDNA and genomic clones showed the absence of introns in bglB. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of cell lysates from Escherichia coli bglB clones confirmed the presence of an expressed protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa, which is consistent with that expected for an unglycosylated form of the enzyme. Amino acid comparisons of BglB with other beta-glucosidase sequences suggest that it is a member of family 1 glycosyl hydrolases but is unusual in that it contains an additional 100 to 130 amino acids at the N terminus. This sequence did not have homologies to other known protein sequences and may impart unique properties to this beta-glucosidase. 
14586108	20031031	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Mode of alpha-amylase production by the shochu koji mold Aspergillus kawachii.	Aspergillus kawachii produces two kinds of alpha-amylase, one is an acid-unstable alpha-amylase and the other is an acid-stable alpha-amylase. Because the quality of the shochu depends strongly on the activities of the alpha-amylases, the culture conditions under which these alpha-amylases are produced were examined. In liquid culture, acid-unstable alpha-amylase was produced abundantly, but, acid-stable alpha-amylase was not produced. The acid-unstable alpha-amylase was produced significantly when glycerol or glucose was used as a carbon source, similarly to the use of inducers such as starch or maltose. In liquid culture, A. kawachii assimilated starch at pH 3.0, but no alpha-amylase activity was recognized in the medium. Instead, the alpha-amylase was found to be trapped in the cell wall. The trapped form was identified as acid-unstable alpha-amylase. Usually, acid-unstable alpha-amylase is unstable at pH 3.0, so its stability appeared to be due to its immobilization in the cell wall. In solid-state culture, both kinds of alpha-amylase were produced. The production of acid-stable alpha-amylase seems to be solid-state culture-specific and was affected by the moisture content in the solid medium. 
20336338	20100326	Mar._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning of exo-β-1,3-glucanase gene from a marine yeast Williopsis saturnus and its overexpression in Yarrowia lipolytica.	The exo-β-1,3-glucanase structural gene (WsEXG1 gene, accession number: FJ875997.2) was isolated from both the genomic DNA and cDNA of the marine yeast Williopsis saturnus WC91-2 by inverse PCR and RT-PCR. An open reading frame of 1,254 bp encoding a 417 amino acid protein (isoelectric point: 4.5) with calculated molecular weight of 46.2 kDa was characterized. The promoter of the gene (intronless) was located from -28 to -77 and had one TATA box while its terminator contained the sequence AAGAACAATAAACAA from +1,386 to +1,401. The protein had the Family 5 glycoside hydrolase signature IGLELLNEPL and a fragment with the sequence of NLCGEWSAA, where the Glu-310 (E) was considered to be the catalytic nucleophile. The WsEXG1 gene was overexpressed in Yarrowia lipolytica Po1h and the recombinant WsEXG1 was purified and characterized. The molecular weight of the purified rWsEXG1 was 46.0 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified rWsEXG1 were 5.0°C and 40°C, respectively. The purified rWsEXG1 had high exo-β-1,3-glucanase activity. Therefore, the recombinant β-1,3-glucanase may have highly potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries.

D003160 D016428 D013485 	Arabinoxylan degradation by fungi: characterization of the arabinoxylan-arabinofuranohydrolase encoding genes from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis.	The genes encoding the enzyme arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase, which releases L-arabinose from arabinoxylan, have been cloned from the closely related fungi Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis and were shown to be functional in A. niger. Integration of multiple copies in the genome resulted in over-expression of the enzymes. The arabinofuranohydrolases encoded comprise 332 amino acids and have 94% amino acid identity. Their primary structure is not related to those of other alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases, except for a low similarity with XYLC, a bacterial alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Pseudomonas fluorescens which acts on oat spelt xylan. The axhA expression pattern in A. niger differed from that of abfB, since it was strongly induced by birchwood xylan and much less by L-arabitol or L-arabinose. Furthermore, Northern analysis revealed that axhA expression was de repressed in creAd mutants and carbon catabolite repressed by D-glucose. 
9212401	19970701	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of two rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase genes from Aspergillus niger.	A rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase gene of Aspergillus aculeatus was used as a probe for the cloning of two rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase genes of Aspergillus niger. The corresponding proteins, rhamnogalacturonan hydrolases A and B, are 78 and 72% identical, respectively, with the A. aculeatus enzyme. In A. niger cultures which were shifted from growth on sucrose to growth on apple pectin as a carbon source, the expression of the rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase A gene (rhgA) was transiently induced after 3 h of growth on apple pectin. The rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase B gene was not induced by apple pectin, but the rhgB gene was derepressed after 18 h of growth on either apple pectin or sucrose. Gene fusions of the A. niger rhgA and rhgB coding regions with the strong and inducible Aspergillus awamori exlA promoter were used to obtain high-producing A. awamori transformants which were then used for the purification of the two A. niger rhamnogalacturonan hydrolases. High-performance anion-exchange chromatography of oligomeric degradation products showed that optimal degradation of an isolated highly branched pectin fraction by A. niger rhamnogalacturonan hydrolases A and B occurred at pH 3.6 and 4.1, respectively. The specific activities of rhamnogalacturonan hydrolases A and B were then 0.9 and 0.4 U/mg, respectively, which is significantly lower than the specific activity of A. aculeatus rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase (2.5 U/mg at an optimal pH of 4.5). Compared to the A enzymes, the A. niger B enzyme appears to have a different substrate specificity, since additional oligomers are formed. 
19756584	20090917	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Characterization and kinetic analysis of a thermostable GH3 beta-glucosidase from Penicillium brasilianum.	A GH3 beta-glucosidase (BGL) from Penicillium brasilianum was purified to homogeneity after cultivation on a cellulose and xylan rich medium. The BGL was identified in a genomic library, and it was successfully expressed in Aspergillus oryzae. The BGL had excellent stability at elevated temperatures with no loss in activity after 24 h of incubation at 60 degrees C at pH 4-6, and the BGL was shown to have significantly higher stability at these conditions in comparison to Novozym 188 and to other fungal GH3 BGLs reported in the literature. The BGL had significant lower affinity for cellobiose compared with the artificial substrate para-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNP-Glc) and further, pronounced substrate inhibition using pNP-Glc. Kinetic studies demonstrated the high importance of using cellobiose as substrate and glucose as inhibitor to describe the inhibition kinetics of BGL taking place during cellulose hydrolysis. A novel assay was developed to characterize this glucose inhibition on cellobiose hydrolysis. The assay uses labelled glucose-13C6 as inhibitor and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis to quantify the hydrolysis rates. 
18408068	20080415	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of a new family 45 endoglucanase, STCE1, from Staphylotrichum coccosporum and its overproduction in Humicola insolens.	In the detergent industry, fungal endoglucanases have been used to release microfibrils (defibrillation) from the surface of dyed cellulosic fabrics to enhance color brightness. Although endoglucanases for laundry use must have various properties, such as a neutral or alkaline optimum pH, resistance to anionic surfactants and oxidizing agents (main components in detergents), and high defibrillation activity, all-purpose endoglucanases have not been obtained yet. As a result of screening of endoglucanases, a new family 45 endoglucanase (family 45 glycoside hydrolase), designated STCE1, was obtained and purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture supernatant of Staphylotrichum coccosporum NBRC 31817. The molecular mass of STCE1 was 49 kDa. The optimum pH for the carboxymethyl cellulase activity of STCE1 was 6.0, and the optimum temperature was 60 degrees C. STCE1 was highly resistant to an anionic surfactant and an oxidizing agent. Furthermore, the defibrillation activities on dyed cotton and lyocell fabrics of STCE1 were higher than those of the other representative endoglucanases tested. These results indicate that STCE1 is an all-purpose enzyme for laundry use. A gene encoding STCE1, designated the stce1 gene, was cloned from S. coccosporum, and the complete sequence was determined. STCE1 consisted of three distinct domains: an N-terminal catalytic domain (family 45), a linker domain, and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (family 1). The amino acid sequences of the catalytic domain of STCE1 were phylogenetically close to those of the family 45 endoglucanases EGL3, EGL4, and EGV from a Humicola sp. Hence, the stce1 gene was transferred into Humicola insolens and expressed. As a result, extremely high levels (0.90 mg protein per ml of culture supernatant, 27% of the total proteins) of the recombinant STCE1 were secreted as a mature form in the culture supernatant. 
17008082	20060930	Mycol._Res.	D016428 D013485 	Penicillium purpurogenum produces a family 1 acetyl xylan esterase containing a carbohydrate-binding module: characterization of the protein and its gene.	At least three acetyl xylan esterases (AXE I, II and III) are secreted by Penicillium purpurogenum. This publication describes more detailed work on AXE I and its gene. AXE I binds cellulose but not xylan; it is glycosylated and inactivated by phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, showing that it is a serine esterase. The axe1 gene presents an open reading frame of 1278 bp, including two introns of 68 and 61 bp; it codes for a signal peptide of 31 residues and a mature protein of 351 amino acids (molecular weight 36,693). AXE I has a modular structure: a catalytic module at the amino terminus belonging to family 1 of the carbohydrate esterases, a linker rich in serines and threonines, and a family 1 carboxy terminal carbohydrate binding module (CBM). The CBM is similar to that of AXE from Trichoderma reesei, (with a family 5 catalytic module) indicating that the genes for catalytic modules and CBMs have evolved separately, and that they have been linked by gene fusion. The promoter sequence of axe1 contains several putative sequences for binding of gene expression regulators also found in other family 1 esterase gene promoters. It is proposed that AXE I and II act in succession in xylan degradation; first, xylan is attacked by AXE I and other xylanases possessing CBMs (which facilitate binding to lignocellulose), followed by other enzymes acting mainly on soluble substrates. 
10473406	19990903	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Characterization of an acetyl xylan esterase from the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2.	A 1,067-bp cDNA, designated axeA, coding for an acetyl xylan esterase (AxeA) was cloned from the anaerobic rumen fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2. The gene had an open reading frame of 939 bp encoding a polypeptide of 313 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 34,845 Da. An active esterase using the original start codon of the cDNA was synthesized in Escherichia coli. Two active forms of the esterase were purified from recombinant E. coli cultures. The size difference of 8 amino acids was a result of cleavages at two different sites within the signal peptide. The enzyme released acetate from several acetylated substrates, including acetylated xylan. The activity toward acetylated xylan was tripled in the presence of recombinant xylanase A from the same fungus. Using p-nitrophenyl acetate as a substrate, the enzyme had a K(m) of 0.9 mM and a V(max) of 785 micromol min(-1) mg(-1). It had temperature and pH optima of 30 degrees C and 9.0, respectively. AxeA had 56% amino acid identity with BnaA, an acetyl xylan esterase of Neocallimastix patriciarum, but the Orpinomyces AxeA was devoid of a noncatalytic repeated peptide domain (NCRPD) found at the carboxy terminus of the Neocallimastix BnaA. The NCRPD found in many glycosyl hydrolases and esterases of anaerobic fungi has been postulated to function as a docking domain for cellulase-hemicellulase complexes, similar to the dockerin of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum. The difference in domain structures indicated that the two highly similar esterases of Orpinomyces and Neocallimastix may be differently located, the former being a free enzyme and the latter being a component of a cellulase-hemicellulase complex. Sequence data indicate that AxeA and BnaA might represent a new family of hydrolases. 
22859955	20120804	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 	High resolution crystal structure of the endo-N-Acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase responsible for the deglycosylation of Hypocrea jecorina cellulases.	Endo-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidases (ENGases) hydrolyze the glycosidic linkage between the two N-acetylglucosamine units that make up the chitobiose core of N-glycans. The endo-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidases classified into glycoside hydrolase family 18 are small, bacterial proteins with different substrate specificities. Recently two eukaryotic family 18 deglycosylating enzymes have been identified. Here, the expression, purification and the 1.3Å resolution structure of the ENGase (Endo T) from the mesophilic fungus Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) are reported. Although the mature protein is C-terminally processed with removal of a 46 amino acid peptide, the protein has a complete (β/α)8 TIM-barrel topology. In the active site, the proton donor (E131) and the residue stabilizing the transition state (D129) in the substrate assisted catalysis mechanism are found in almost identical positions as in the bacterial GH18 ENGases: Endo H, Endo F1, Endo F3, and Endo BT. However, the loops defining the substrate-binding cleft vary greatly from the previously known ENGase structures, and the structures also differ in some of the α-helices forming the barrel. This could reflect the variation in substrate specificity between the five enzymes. This is the first three-dimensional structure of a eukaryotic endo-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase from glycoside hydrolase family 18. A glycosylation analysis of the cellulases secreted by a Hypocrea jecorina Endo T knock-out strain shows the in vivo function of the protein. A homology search and phylogenetic analysis show that the two known enzymes and their homologues form a large but separate cluster in subgroup B of the fungal chitinases. Therefore the future use of a uniform nomenclature is proposed.

Three endoglucanase genes, designated the rce1, rce2, and rce3 genes, were isolated from Rhizopus oryzae as the first cellulase genes from the subdivision ZYGOMYCOTA: All the amino acid sequences deduced from the rce1, rce2, and rce3 genes consisted of three distinct domains: cellulose binding domains, linker domains, and catalytic domains belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 45. The rce3 gene had two tandem repeated sequences of cellulose binding domains, while rce1 and rce2 had only one. rce1, rce2, and rce3 had various lengths of linker sequences. 
10642523	20000122	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	pgaA and pgaB encode two constitutively expressed endopolygalacturonases of Aspergillus niger.	The nucleotide sequence data for pgaA and pgaB have been deposited with the EMBL, GenBank and DDBJ Databases under accession numbers Y18804 and Y18805 respectively. pgaA and pgaB, two genes encoding endopolygalacturonases (PGs, EC 3.2.1.15) A and B, were isolated from a phage genomic library of Aspergillus niger N400. The 1167 bp protein coding region of the pgaA gene is interrupted by one intron, whereas the 1234 bp coding region of the pgaB gene contains two introns. The corresponding proteins, PGA and PGB, consist of 370 and 362 amino acid residues respectively. Northern-blot analysis revealed that pgaA- and pgaB-specific mRNA accumulate in mycelia grown on sucrose. mRNAs are also present upon transfer to media containing D-galacturonic acid and pectin. Recombinant PGA and PGB were characterized with respect to pH optimum, activity on polygalacturonic acid, and mode of action and kinetics on oligogalacturonates of different chain length (n=3-7). At their pH optimum the specific activities in a standard assay for PGA (pH 4.2) and PGB (pH 5.0) were 16.5 mu+kat.mg(-1) and 8.3 mu+kat.mg(-1) respectively. Product progression analysis, using polygalacturonate as a substrate, revealed a random cleavage pattern for both enzymes and indicated processive behaviour for PGA. This result was confirmed by analysis of the mode of action using oligogalacturonates. Processivity was observed when the degree of polymerization of the substrate exceeded 6. Using pectins of various degrees of methyl esterification, it was shown that PGA and PGB both preferred partially methylated substrates. 
12726996	20030503	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 	Purification and properties of two type-B alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases produced by Penicillium chrysogenum.	Two distinct extracellular alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases (AFases; EC 3.2.1.55) were purified from the culture filtrate of Penicillium chrysogenum 31B. The molecular masses of the enzymes were estimated to be 79 kDa (AFQ1) and 52 kDa (AFS1) by SDS-PAGE. Both enzymes had their highest activities at 50 degrees C and were stable up to 50 degrees C. Enzyme activities of AFQ1 and AFS1 were highest at pH 4.0 to 6.5 and pH 3.3 to 5.0, respectively. Addition of 10 mg/ml arabinose to the reaction mixture decreased the AFS1 activity but hardly affected AFQ1. Both enzymes displayed broad substrate specificities; they released arabinose from branched arabinan, debranched arabinan, arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan, and arabino-oligosaccharides. AFS1 also showed low activity towards p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside. An exo-arabinanase, which catalyzes the release of arabinobiose from linear arabinan at the nonreducing terminus, acted synergistically with both enzymes to produce L-arabinose from branched arabinan. 
1761224	19911201	Gene	D016428 	Nucleotide sequence and expression of the glucoamylase-encoding gene (glaA) from Aspergillus oryzae.	The glucoamylase-encoding gene (glaA) from Aspergillus oryzae was cloned using its cDNA as a probe, which had been isolated previously. From comparison of nucleotide (nt) sequences of genomic clones with its cDNA, the glaA gene was found to contain four short putative introns, 45-56 nt in length. The A. oryzae glaA gene shared 62% homology at the nt level with the A. niger glaA gene with the four introns located at the same position. The 5'-flanking region contained a TATA box at nt-72 from the start codon, and two putative CAAT sequences at nt-87 and -331. Genomic Southern analysis and physical mapping showed that the glaA gene is located on the smallest chromosome (3.4 Mb) of six separated bands of chromosomes. Clones containing the glaA gene, when re-introduced intro A. oryzae, resulted in a three- to eightfold increase in glucoamylase activity. 
10588045	19991210	Can._J._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a Neocallimastix patriciarum xylanase gene and its product.	A xylanase gene (xynC) isolated from the anaerobic ruminal fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum was characterized. The gene consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain that exhibited homology to family 11 of glycosyl hydrolases, a C-terminal cellulose binding domain (CBD) and a putative dockerin domain in between. Each domain was linked by a short linker domain rich in proline and alanine. Deletion analysis demonstrated that the CBD was essential for optimal xylanase activity of the enzyme, while the putative dockerin domain may not be required for enzyme function. 
22112956	20111125	Enzyme_Microb._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Chrysosporium lucknowense C1 arabinofuranosidases are selective in releasing arabinose from either single or double substituted xylose residues in arabinoxylans.	Two novel arabinofuranosidases, Abn7 and Abf3 from Chrysosporium lucknowense (C1), belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 43 and 51 were purified and characterized. Abn7 is exclusively able to hydrolyze arabinofuranosyl residues at position O-3 of double substituted xylosyl residues in arabinoxylan-derived oligosaccharides, an activity rarely found thus far. Abf3 is able to release arabinose from position O-2 or O-3 of single substituted xyloses. Both enzymes performed optimal at pH 5.0 and 40°C. Combining Abn7 and Abf3 resulted in a synergistic increase in arabinose release from arabinoxylans. This synergistic effect is due to the action of Abf3 on the remaining arabinose residues at position O-2 on single substituted xylosyl residues resulting from the action of Abn7 on double substituted xylosyl residues. Arabinose release was further increased when an endo-1,4-β-xylanase was present during digestion. The efficiency of these arabinohydrolases from C1 on insoluble arabinoxylan substrates is discussed. 
12788920	20030606	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 	Transcriptional regulation of biomass-degrading enzymes in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei.	The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei produces and secretes profuse quantities of enzymes that act synergistically to degrade cellulase and related biomass components. We partially sequenced over 5100 random T. reesei cDNA clones. Among the sequences whose predicted gene products had significant similarity to known proteins, 12 were identified that encode previously unknown enzymes that likely function in biomass degradation. Microarrays were used to query the expression levels of each of the sequences under different conditions known to induce cellulolytic enzyme synthesis. Most of the genes encoding known and putative biomass-degrading enzymes were transcriptionally co-regulated. Moreover, despite the fact that several of these enzymes are not thought to degrade cellulase directly, they were coordinately overexpressed in a cellulase overproducing strain. A variety of additional sequences whose function could not be ascribed using the limited sequence available displayed analogous behavior and may also play a role in biomass degradation or in the synthesis of biomass-degrading enzymes. Sequences exhibiting additional regulatory patterns were observed that might reflect roles in regulation of cellulase biosynthesis. However, genes whose products are involved in protein processing and secretion were not highly regulated during cellulase induction. 
10584016	19991203	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 	The bglA gene of Aspergillus kawachii encodes both extracellular and cell wall-bound beta-glucosidases.	We cloned the genomic DNA and cDNA of bglA, which encodes beta-glucosidase in Aspergillus kawachii, based on a partial amino acid sequence of purified cell wall-bound beta-glucosidase CB-1. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned bglA gene revealed a 2,933-bp open reading frame with six introns that encodes an 860-amino-acid protein. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, we concluded that the bglA gene encodes cell wall-bound beta-glucosidase CB-1. The amino acid sequence exhibited high levels of homology with the amino acid sequences of fungal beta-glucosidases classified in subfamily B. We expressed the bglA cDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and detected the recombinant beta-glucosidase in the periplasm fraction of the recombinant yeast. A. kawachii can produce two extracellular beta-glucosidases (EX-1 and EX-2) in addition to the cell wall-bound beta-glucosidase. A. kawachii in which the bglA gene was disrupted produced none of the three beta-glucosidases, as determined by enzyme assays and a Western blot analysis. Thus, we concluded that the bglA gene encodes both extracellular and cell wall-bound beta-glucosidases in A. kawachii. 
23107704	20121031	Food_Chem	D016428 D013485 	Α-L-arabinofuranosidase 3 from Penicillium purpurogenum (ABF3): potential application in the enhancement of wine flavour and heterologous expression of the enzyme.	An α-l-arabinofuranosidase (ABF3) from Penicillium purpurogenum was purified and its possible biotechnological application in the enhancement of wine flavour combined with P. purpurogenum β-glucosidase was studied. A must from Muscat of Alexandria was used to isolate the glycosides. The total monosaccharide (glucose, arabinose and xylose) levels in the glycosides were determined after acid hydrolysis, and were compared with the result of enzymatic hydrolysis. These results were analogous to those obtained in similar experiments using a commercial preparation, thus suggesting that the enzyme from P. purpurogenum may prove useful in this particular application. This prompted us to express the enzyme heterologously. The abf3 gene was thus expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant enzyme was purified and it shows the same properties of the native ABF3 (substrate specificity, kinetic constants, pH and temperature optima and antibody cross-reactivity). 
11319099	20010425	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular characterization of an endopolygalacturonase from Fusarium oxysporum expressed during early stages of infection.	The tomato vascular wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici produces an array of pectinolytic enzymes that may contribute to penetration and colonization of the host plant. Here we report the isolation of pg5, encoding a novel extracellular endopolygalacturonase (endoPG) that is highly conserved among different formae speciales of F. oxysporum. The putative mature pg5 product has a calculated molecular mass of 35 kDa and a pI of 8.3 and is more closely related to endoPGs from other fungal plant pathogens than to PG1, the major endoPG of F. oxysporum. Overexpression of pg5 in a bacterial heterologous system produced a 35-kDa protein with endoPG activity. Accumulation of pg5 transcript is induced by citrus pectin and D-galacturonic acid and repressed by glucose. As shown by reverse transcription-PCR, pg5 is expressed by F. oxysporum in tomato roots during the initial stages of infection. Targeted inactivation of pg5 has no detectable effect on virulence toward tomato plants. 
15280646	20040729	Antonie_Van_Leeuwenhoek	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of the AINV gene and the encoded invertase from the dimorphic yeast Arxula adeninivorans.	The invertase-encoding of AINV gene Arxula adeninivorans was isolated and characterized. The gene includes a coding sequence of 2700 bp encoding a putative 899 amino acid protein of 101.7 kDa. The identity of the gene was confirmed by a high degree of homology of the derived amino acid sequence to that of alpha-glucosidases from different sources. The gene activity is regulated by carbon source. In media supplemented with sucrose induction of the AINV gene and accumulation of the encoded invertase in the medium was observed. In addition the extracellular enzyme level is influenced by the morphological status of the organism, with mycelia secreting the enzyme in titres higher than those observed in budding yeasts. The enzyme characteristics were analysed from isolates of native strains as well as from those of recombinant strains expressing the AINV gene under control of the strong A. adeninivorans -derived TEF1 promoter. For both proteins a molecular mass of 600 kDa was determined, a pH optimum at pH 4.5 and a temperature optimum at 55 degrees C. The preferred substrates for the enzyme included the ss-D-fructofuranosides sucrose, inulin and raffinose. Only a weak enzyme activity was observed for the alpha-D-glucopyranosides maltotriose, maltose and isomaltose. Thus the invertase primarily is a ss-fructosidase and not an alpha-glucosidase as suggested by the homology to such enzymes. 
16232497	20051020	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Purification, characterization and gene analysis of exo-cellulase II (Ex-2) from the white rot basidiomycete Irpex lacteus.	A new exo-type cellulase, named exo-cellulase II (Ex-2), was purified from the crude enzyme preparation of Irpex lacteus. Ex-2 was very similar to the previously characterized exo-cellulase I (Ex-1) with respect to enzymatic features such as optimal pH, temperature, heat stability, and catalytic activity. However, Ex-2 exhibited greater pH stability than Ex-1. The molecular mass and carbohydrate content of Ex-2 (56,000, 4.0%) were different from those of Ex-1 (53,000, 2.0%). A cellulase gene (named cel2) encoding both Ex-2 and Ex-1 was isolated from an I. lacteus genomic library. The cel2 gene was found to consist of 1569 bp with an open reading frame encoding 523 amino acids, interrupted by two introns. The deduced amino acid sequences revealed that cel2 ORF has a modular structure consisting of a catalytic domain and a fungal-type cellulose-binding domain (CBD) separated by a serine-rich linker region. The catalytic domain was homologous to those of fungal cellobiohydrolases belonging to family 7 of the glycosyl hydrolases. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of the cel2 gene was induced by various cellulosic substrates and repressed by glucose, fructose, and lactose. 
7789795	19950526	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, characterization and functional expression of an endoglucanase-encoding gene from the phytopathogenic fungus Macrophomina phaseolina.	An endoglucanase-encoding clone (egl2) was isolated from the phytopathogenic soilborne deuteromycete fungus Macrophomina phaseolina (Mp). Clones were obtained from a cDNA library by functional expression in Escherichia coli. The egl2 clone hybridized to a 1.3-kb mRNA. Expression is induced by carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and repressed by glucose. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence revealed strong similarity to the egl3 from Trichoderma reesei (Tr) (72% for identical residues and 81% with conservative substitution over a span of 324 aa). The Mp egl2 lacks the cellulose-binding domain and linker region found in the Tr egl3. Different codon usage between the two fungi resulted in a much shorter span of nucleotide homology. The Egl2 protein cleaves cellodextrins with continguous beta, 1-4 linkages of four and larger, and shows activity against CMC and birchwood xylan.

An endo-chitosanase gene was cloned from Aspergillus sp. CJ22-326 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein showed an endo-chitosanase activity during viscosimetric assay and TLC analysis. The enzyme had higher chitosanolytic activity than previously reported fungal chitosanases. 
14648113	20031203	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	A novel beta-glucosidase in Uromyces fabae: feast or fight?	Efficient nutrient mobilization is a key element for biotrophic plant parasites such as the rust fungi. In the course of a cDNA library screen for elements involved in sugar utilization in Uromyces fabae, we identified a sequence with homology to beta-glucosidases. Full-length genomic and cDNA clones of the gene, termed BGL1, were isolated and sequenced. The BGL1 gene comprises 3,372 nucleotides, including nine introns. The open reading frame encompasses 2,532 bases and codes for a polypeptide of 843 amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 92.4 kDa. Analysis of the polypeptide revealed a potential secretion signal, indicating an extracellular localization of mature BGL1p (89.8 kDa). BGL1 seems to be expressed in all stages of growth, including haustoria, the feeding structures of rust fungi. In the course of immunolocalization studies, the gene product BGL1p was localized in the periphery of intercellular hyphae and haustoria. On the basis of sequence homology, the BGL1 gene was identified as a fungal beta-glucosidase. 
9165762	19970228	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and sequencing of an alpha-glucosidase gene from Aspergillus niger and its expression in A. nidulans.	We have cloned an extracellular alpha-glucosidase gene from Aspergillus niger with oligonucleotide probes synthesized on the basis of the determined peptide sequences. The nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 985 amino acids split with three introns, and the deduced amino acid sequence was nearly identical to that of the alpha-glucosidase previously determined. The cloned gene was introduced into Aspergillus nidulans, and its expression in the transformants was shown to be regulated by the carbon sources in the medium, suggesting that a common regulatory expression system is shared by these two species as is the case of other starch-degrading enzymes of Aspergillus species. 
17551789	20070607	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning, characterization, and expression of a chitinase from the entomopathogenic fungus Paecilomyces javanicus.	Paecilomyces javanicus is an entomopathogenic fungus of coleopteran and lepidopteran insects. Here we report on cloning, characterization, and expression patterns of a chitinase from P. javanicus. A strong chitinase activity was detected in P. javanicus cultures added to chitin. The full-length cDNA, designated PjChi-1, was cloned from mycelia by using both degenerate primer/reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification and 5'-/3'-RACE extension. The 1.18-kb cDNA gene contains a 1035-bp open reading frame and encodes a 345-amino acid polypeptide with a deduced molecular mass of 37 kDa. A conserved motif for chitinase activity -F82DGIDIDWE90- was present in deduced amino acid sequence. Both RT-PCR and Northern analysis revealed that the expression of the PjChi gene was constitutive at low level, but enhanced to high level when chitin was the substrate. Fungal inhibitory assay showed that PjChi-1 inhibited the growth of phytopathogenic fungi such as Sclerotium rolfsii, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Aspergillus nidulans, and Rhizoctonia solani. 
18998121	20081111	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	A novel highly acidic beta-mannanase from the acidophilic fungus Bispora sp. MEY-1: gene cloning and overexpression in Pichia pastoris.	Using degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, a 1,347-bp full-length complementary DNA fragment encompassing the gene man5A, which encodes a 429-amino acid beta-mannanase with a calculated mass of 46.8 kDa, was cloned from acidophilic Bispora sp. MEY-1. The deduced amino acid sequence (catalytic domain) displayed highest identity (54.1%) with the Emericella nidulans endo-beta-1,4-D-mannanase, a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 5. Recombinant MAN5A was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and its activity in the culture medium reached 500 U ml(-1). The enzyme was acidophilic, with highest activity at pH 1.0-1.5, lower than any known mannanases, and optimal temperature for activity was 65 degrees C. MAN5A had good pH adaptability, excellent thermal and pH stability, and high resistance to both pepsin and trypsin. The specific activity, K(m), and V(max) for locust bean gum substrate was 3,373 U mg(-1), 1.56 mg ml(-1), and 6,587.6 micromol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. The enzymatic activity was not significantly affected by ions such as Ca(2+), Cr(3+), Co(2+), Zn(2+), Na(+), K(+), and Mg(2+) and enhanced by Ni(2+), Fe(3+), Mn(2+) and Ag(+). These favorable properties make MAN5A a potential candidate for use in various industrial applications. 
18490176	20080521	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, heterologous gene expression and biochemical characterization of the alpha-1,3-glucanase from the filamentous fungus Penicillium purpurogenum.	There has been much recent interest in alpha-1,3-glucanases (mutanases) as they have the potential to be used in the treatment of dental caries. Mutanases have been reported in a number of bacteria, yeast and fungi but remain a relatively uncharacterised family of enzymes. In this study we heterologously expressed the mutanase gene from the filamentous fungus Penicillium purpurogenum to enable further characterization of its enzymatic activity. The mutanase cDNA was cloned and expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of the secreted protein was about 102 kDa. The recombinant enzyme hydrolyzed mutan with a specific activity of 3.9 U/mg of protein. The recombinant enzyme was specific for mutan and could not cleave a variety of other polysaccharides demonstrating a specificity for alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. The pH and temperature optima were pH 4.6 and 45 degrees C, respectively. Synthetic compounds were also tested as substrates to assess whether the P. purpurogenum mutanase has an exo- or endo-type mechanism of hydrolysis. The results suggest an endo-hydrolytic mode of action. The type of mechanism was confirmed since mutanase activity was not suppressed in the presence of inhibitors of exo-type enzymes. 
11357511	20010519	Arch._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Expression of Pichia anomala INV1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in two different active forms of hypoglycosylated invertase.	The Pichia anomala invertase gene (INV1) was introduced at different copy numbers into a sucrose-nonfermenting mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and expressed from its own promoter sequences. The level reached in the production of invertase by the transformants (up to 540 units/10(10) cells) was in agreement with the INV1 gene dosage. Two forms of multimeric active and glycosylated invertase displaying different subcellular locations and molecular masses could be detected in the transformants. One was found to be present in the culture medium and in the periplasm, and the other could only be detected inside the cell. Each of the two heterologous forms of invertase was shown to be an oligomer composed of identical subunits. The difference found in the apparent molecular masses of their monomers (81.5 and 78.3 kDa, respectively) seems to be due to the size of their N-linked oligosaccharide chains (on average 2.4 and 1.9 kDa, respectively), since the number of sugar chains (9) and the molecular mass of the protein moiety (60.5 kDa) are identical in both forms. The shorter size of their oligosaccharides must also be the reason for the lower apparent molecular masses of the heterologous invertases when compared with the enzyme purified from P. anomala. The hypoglycosylated invertase accumulated within the cells of the transformants to an unusual level (up to 130 units/10(10) cells). Such accumulation of active enzyme inside the cells, as well as its underglycosylation, could be due to intrinsic properties of the P. anomala invertase that are determined by the particular primary structure of its protein moiety. 
18247030	20080206	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Biochemical and molecular characterization of a putative endoglucanase in Magnaporthe grisea.	Microbial pathogens secrete an array of cell wall-degrading enzymes to break down the structure of the host cell wall to facilitate colonization of the host tissue. To better understand their role in the pathogenesis, a putative endoglucanase from Magnaporthe grisea was characterized in this paper. SignalP-3.0 analysis indicates that the protein encoded by gene MGG_02532.5 in M. grisea (named MgEGL1 for M. grisea endoglucanase 1) contains a secretory signal peptide. Multiple alignment shows that MgEGL1 has high level of homology to endoglucanases (EC 3.1.1.4) from Aspergillus nidulans and Trichoderma reesei. The three proteins share a conserved catalytic domain, but only the one from T. reesei contains a cellulose binding module. MgEGL1 was constitutively expressed with the highest level in mycelia and the lowest in conidia. Interestingly, the MgEGL1 RNA could be alternatively processed when cultured in vitro and after infection of rice. Expression analysis confirmed that the MgEGL1 is a secreted protein. Its endoglucanase activity was assayed by Congo red plates, and further confirmed by the dinitrosalicylic acid method. The finding in this paper will provide the basis for further determination of the biochemical properties of the endoglucanase protein and its relevant function in fungal pathogenesis. 
19205049	20090211	Biotechnol._Prog.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, expression and characterization of endo-beta-1,4-mannanase from Aspergillus fumigatus in Aspergillus sojae and Pichia pastoris.	To be utilized in biomass conversion, including ethanol production and galactosylated oligosaccharide synthesis, namely prebiotics, the gene of extracellular endo-beta-1,4-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) of Aspergillus fumigatus IMI 385708 (formerly known as Thermomyces lanuginosus IMI 158749) was expressed first in Aspergillus sojae and then in Pichia pastoris under the control of the glyceraldehyde triphosphate dehydrogenase (gpdA) and the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoters, respectively. The highest production of mannanase (352 U mL(-1)) in A. sojae was observed after 6 days of cultivation. In P. pastoris, the highest mannanase production was observed 10 h after induction with methanol (61 U mL(-1)). The fold increase in mannanase production was estimated as approximately 12-fold and approximately 2-fold in A. sojae and P. pastoris, respectively, when compared with A. fumigatus. Both recombinant enzymes showed molecular mass of about 60 kDa and similar specific activities ( approximately 350 U mg(-1) protein). Temperature optima were at 60 degrees C and 45 degrees C, and maximum activity was at pH 4.5 and 5.2 for A. sojae and P. pastoris, respectively. The enzyme from P. pastoris was more stable retaining most of the activity up to 50 degrees C, whereas the enzyme from A. sojae rapidly lost activity above 40 degrees C. 
19060392	20081209	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Comparison of sucrose-hydrolyzing enzymes produced by Rhizopus oryzae and Amylomyces rouxii.	Rhizopus oryzae produces lactic acid from glucose but not efficiently from sucrose, while Amylomyces rouxii, a species closely related to R. oryzae, ferments these sugars equally. The properties of two sucrose-hydrolyzing enzymes purified from culture filtrates of R. oryzae NBRC 4785 and A. rouxii CBS 438.76 were compared to assess lactic acid fermentation by the two fungi. The substrate specificity of the enzymes showed that the enzymes from strains NBRC 4785 and CBS 438.76 are to be classified as glucoamylase and invertase respectively. The entity of the enzyme from strain NBRC 4785 might be a glucoamylase, because eight residues of the N-terminal amino acid sequence coincided with those of the deduced protein from the amyB gene of R. oryzae. The enzyme from NBRC 4785 was more unstable than that from strain CBS 438.76 under conditions of lower pH and higher temperature. These observations mean that the culture conditions of R. oryzae for lactic acid production from sucrose should be strictly controlled to prevent inactivation of the glucoamylase hydrolyzing sucrose. 
9440512	19980124	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 	aguA, the gene encoding an extracellular alpha-glucuronidase from Aspergillus tubingensis, is specifically induced on xylose and not on glucuronic acid.	An extracellular alpha-glucuronidase was purified and characterized from a commercial Aspergillus preparation and from culture filtrate of Aspergillus tubingensis. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 107 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 112 kDa as determined by mass spectrometry, has a determined pI just below 5.2, and is stable at pH 6.0 for prolonged times. The pH optimum for the enzyme is between 4.5 and 6.0, and the temperature optimum is 70 degrees C. The alpha-glucuronidase is active mainly on small substituted xylo-oligomers but is also able to release a small amount of 4-O-methylglucuronic acid from birchwood xylan. The enzyme acts synergistically with endoxylanases and beta-xylosidase in the hydrolysis of xylan. The enzyme is N glycosylated and contains 14 putative N-glycosylation sites. The gene encoding this alpha-glucuronidase (aguA) was cloned from A. tubingensis. It consists of an open reading frame of 2,523 bp and contains no introns. The gene codes for a protein of 841 amino acids, containing a eukaryotic signal sequence of 20 amino acids. The mature protein has a predicted molecular mass of 91,790 Da and a calculated pI of 5.13. Multiple copies of the gene were introduced in A. tubingensis, and expression was studied in a highly overproducing transformant. The aguA gene was expressed on xylose, xylobiose, and xylan, similarly to genes encoding endoxylanases, suggesting a coordinate regulation of expression of xylanases and alpha-glucuronidase. Glucuronic acid did not induce the expression of aguA and also did not modulate the expression on xylose. Addition of glucose prevented expression of aguA on xylan but only reduced the expression on xylose. 
20208428	20100309	J._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and characterization of two major endoglucanases from Penicillium decumbens.	Two major endoglucanase genes (cel7B and cel5A) were cloned from Penicillium decumbens 114-2 using the method of modified thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR). The result of Southern blotting suggested that P. decumbens has a single copy of the cel5A gene and a single copy of cel7B gene in its chromosomal DNA. The expression level of cel5A and cel7B were determined by means of real-time quantitative PCR, suggesting that two genes were coordinately expressed and repressed by glucose and induced by cellulose. Both endoglucanase genes were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the recombinant proteins were purified. The recombinant Cel7B and Cel5A were both optimal active at 60 C and pH 4.0. The recombinant Cel7B showed more than 8-fold, 30-fold, 5-fold higher enzyme activity towards carboxymethyl cellulose, barely beta-glucan and PASC respectively in comparison with that of Cel5A. However, their activities toward pNPC and Avicel were minor difference. The result suggested that Cel7B is a strict endoglucanase, while Cel5A show processivity because of its relative higher ability to hydrolyze the crystal cellulose. 
20709852	20100817	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D003160 D016428 	Characterization of a cellobiohydrolase (MoCel6A) produced by Magnaporthe oryzae.	Three GH-6 family cellobiohydrolases are expected in the genome of Magnaporthe grisea based on the complete genome sequence. Here, we demonstrate the properties, kinetics, and substrate specificities of a Magnaporthe oryzae GH-6 family cellobiohydrolase (MoCel6A). In addition, the effect of cellobiose on MoCel6A activity was also investigated. MoCel6A contiguously fused to a histidine tag was overexpressed in M. oryzae and purified by affinity chromatography. MoCel6A showed higher hydrolytic activities on phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose (PSC), β-glucan, and cellooligosaccharide derivatives than on cellulose, of which the best substrates were cellooligosaccharides. A tandemly aligned cellulose binding domain (CBD) at the N terminus caused increased activity on cellulose and PSC, whereas deletion of the CBD (catalytic domain only) showed decreased activity on cellulose. MoCel6A hydrolysis of cellooligosaccharides and sulforhodamine-conjugated cellooligosaccharides was not inhibited by exogenously adding cellobiose up to 438 mM, which, rather, enhanced activity, whereas a GH-7 family cellobiohydrolase from M. oryzae (MoCel7A) was severely inhibited by more than 29 mM cellobiose. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of cellobiose on hydrolytic activities using MoCel6A and Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase (TrCel6A), which were prepared in Aspergillus oryzae. MoCel6A showed increased hydrolysis of cellopentaose used as a substrate in the presence of 292 mM cellobiose at pH 4.5 and pH 6.0, and enhanced activity disappeared at pH 9.0. In contrast, TrCel6A exhibited slightly increased hydrolysis at pH 4.5, and hydrolysis was severely inhibited at pH 9.0. These results suggest that enhancement or inhibition of hydrolytic activities by cellobiose is dependent on the reaction mixture pH. 
1425667	19921015	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Substrate specificity and properties of the aryl-alcohol oxidase from the ligninolytic fungus Pleurotus eryngii.	The production in a 5-1 fermenter of the extracellular enzymes laccase and aryl-alcohol oxidase by the fungus Pleurotus eryngii was studied. The latter enzyme has been purified 50-fold by Sephacryl S-200 and Mono Q chromatography. Purified aryl-alcohol oxidase is a unique flavoprotein with 15% carbohydrate content, a molecular mass of 72.6 kDa (SDS/PAGE) and a pI of 3.9. The enzyme presents wide specificity, showing activity on benzyl, cinnamyl, naphthyl and aliphatic unsaturated alcohols. Neither activity nor inhibition of veratryl alcohol oxidation was found with saturated alcohols, but competitive inhibition was produced by aromatic compounds which were not aryl-alcohol oxidase substrates, such as phenol or 3-phenyl-1-propanol. From these results, it was apparent that a double bond conjugated with a primary alcohol is necessary for substrate recognition by aryl-alcohol oxidase, and that activity is increased by the presence of additional conjugated double bonds and electron donor groups. Both affinity and maximal velocity during enzymic oxidation of methoxybenzyl alcohols were affected in a similar way by ring substituents, increasing from benzyl alcohol (Km = 0.84 mM, Vmax = 52 U/mg) to 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (Km = 0.04 mM, Vmax = 208 U/mg). Aryl-alcohol oxidase presents also a low oxidase activity with aromatic aldehydes, but the highest activity was found in the presence of electron-withdrawing groups.

A gene (cen1) coding for an endoglucanase I (En-1) was isolated from white rot fungus Irpex lacteus strain MC-2. The cen1 ORF was comprised of 399 amino acid residues and interrupted by 14 introns. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cen1 ORF revealed a multi-domain structure composed of a cellulose-binding domain, a Ser-/Thr-rich linker, and a catalytic domain from the N-terminus. It showed a significant similarity to those of other endoglucanases that belong to family 5 of glycosyl hydrolases. cen1 cDNA was inserted into a yeast expression vector, YEpFLAG-1, and introduced into Saccharomyces cerevesiae. The resulting S. cerevisiae transformant secreted a recombinant En-1 that had enzymatic properties similar to the original En-1. A strong synergistic effect for a degradation of Avicel and phosphoric acid swollen cellulose was observed when recombinant En-1 was used together with a major exo-type cellobiohydrolase I of I. lacteus MC-2.

The cDNA sequences contained open reading frames of 1,389 base pairs (bp) (bgl1A) and 1,623 bp (bgl1B), encoding 462 and 530 amino acids, respectively. Although high sequence identity (65%) was observed between the deduced amino acid sequences of the two enzymes, an apparent difference was observed at the C-terminal region: BGL1B has a 63-amino acid extension, which has no similarity with any known protein. Both recombinant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli showed hydrolytic activity towards several beta-glycosidic compounds. However, the substrate recognition patterns of the two enzymes were quite different from each other. In particular, cellobiose was hydrolyzed more effectively by BGL1B than by BGL1A. The expression of the two genes in the fungus was monitored by reverse transcription-PCR, which showed that bgl1A was expressed constitutively in both glucose- and cellobiose-containing culture, whereas bgl1B was expressed in cellobiose culture but was repressed in glucose culture, possibly because of carbon catabolite repression. We conclude that BGL1B contributes to cellobiose metabolism during cellulose degradation by P. chrysosporium. 
17928959	20071012	Biotechnol._Lett.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of a novel endo-beta-1,4-glucanase from the thermoacidophilic Aspergillus terreus.	An endo-beta-1,4-glucanase from a thermoacidophilic fungus, Aspergillus terreus M11, was purified 18-fold with 14% yield and a specific activity of 67 U mg(-1) protein. The optimal pH was 2 and the cellulase was stable from pH 2 to 5. The cellulase had a temperature optimum of 60 degrees C measured over 30 min and retained more than 60% of its activity after heating at 70 degrees C for 1 h. The molecular mass of the cellulase was about 25 kDa. Its activity was inhibited by 77% by Hg(2+) (2 mM) and by 59% by Cu(2+) (2 mM). 
10052135	19990303	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of Aspergillus ficuum endoinulinase.	Endoinulinase from Aspergillus ficuum, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of inulin via an endo-cleavage mode, was purified by chromatography from Novozym 230 as a starting commercial enzyme mixture on CM-Sephadex and DEAE-Sepharose, and by preparative electrophoresis under native conditions. The enzyme was estimated to be pure on the basis of its I/S ratio, whose value was infinite in our assay conditions. Two forms separated by using this method. SDS gel electrophoresis showed the two purified forms to respectively exhibit molecular weights of 64,000 +/- 500 and 66,000 +/- 1,000. The results of deglycosylation indicated that the two forms were originally the same protein but with different sugar contents. A molecular weight of 54,800 +/- 1,500 was found by gel filtration of the native enzyme, indicating the native functional protein to be a monomer. The enzyme showed nearly absolute substrate specificity towards inulin and inulooligosaccharides, and acted via an endo-attack to produce mainly inulotriose during the late stage of the reaction. The apparent Km and Vmax values for inulin hydrolysis were 8.1 +/- 1.0 mM and 773 +/- 60 U/mg, respectively. The internal peptides of the enzyme showed sequence homology to the endoinulinase of Penicillium purpurogenum. 
8797842	19960815	Eur._J._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Three alpha-galactosidase genes of Trichoderma reesei cloned by expression in yeast.	Three alpha-galactosidase genes, agl1, agl2 and agl3, were isolated from a cDNA expression library of Trichoderma reesei RutC-30 constructed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by screening the library on plates containing the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside. The genes agl1, agl2 and agl3 encode 444, 746 and 624 amino acids, respectively, including the signal sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences of AGLI and AGLIII showed similarity with the alpha-galactosidases of plant, animal, yeast and filamentous fungal origin classified into family 27 of glycosyl hydrolases whereas the deduced amino acid sequence of AGLII showed similarity with the bacterial alpha-galactosidases of family 36. The enzymes produced by yeast were analysed for enzymatic activity against different substrates. AGLI, AGLII and AGLIII were able to hydrolyse the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside and the small galactose-containing oligosaccharides, melibiose and raffinose. They liberated galactose from polymeric galacto(gluco)mannan with different efficiencies. The action of AGLI towards polymeric substrates was enhanced by the presence of the endo-1,4-beta-mannanase of T. reesei. AGLII and AGLIII showed synergy in galacto(gluco)mannan hydrolysis with the endo-1,4-beta-mannanase of T. reesei and a beta-mannosidase of Aspergillus niger. The calculated molecular mass and the hydrolytic properties of AGLI indicate that it corresponds to the alpha-galactosidase previously purified from T. reesei. 
23463247	20130307	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of two novel family 12 xyloglucanases from the thermophilic Rhizomucor miehei.	Two novel glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 12 xyloglucanase genes (designated RmXEG12A and RmXEG12B) were cloned from the thermophilic fungus Rhizomucor miehei. Both genes contained open reading frames of 729 bp encoding 242 amino acids. Their deduced amino acid sequences shared 68% identity with each other and less than 60% with other xyloglucanases. The two genes, without the sequences for the signal peptides, were cloned and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli as active xyloglucanases, designated RmXEG12A and RmXEG12B, with similar molecular masses--25.6 and 25.9 kDa, respectively. RmXEG12A showed optimal activity at pH 6.5 and 65 °C, RmXEG12B at pH 5.0 and 60 °C. Both recombinant xyloglucanases displayed very high specific activities, 6,681.4 and 3,092.2 U mg(-1), respectively, toward tamarind xyloglucan, but no activity toward carboxymethylcellulose, Avicel, or p-nitrophenyl derivatives. The main products of tamarind xyloglucan hydrolysis by the two xyloglucanases were XXXG, XXLG/XLXG, and XLLG (where G is an unsubstituted β-D-Glc residue, X is a xylosylated β-D-Glc residue, and L is a β-D-Glc residue substituted by xylosyl-galactose). 
7788716	19950101	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Expression cloning, purification and characterization of a beta-1,4-galactanase from Aspergillus aculeatus.	Expression cloning has been used to isolate a cDNA encoding beta-1,4-galactanase from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus. A cDNA library was prepared from mycelia, inserted in a yeast expression vector and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thirteen clones secreting galactanase activity were identified from a screening of approximately 2.5 x 10(4) yeast colonies. All clones expressed transcripts of the same galactanase gene. The cDNA was re-cloned in an Aspergillus expression vector and transformed into Aspergillus oryzae. The recombinant enzyme had a molecular weight of 44,000 Da, an isoelectric point of pH 2.85, a pH optimum of pH 4.0-4.5, and a temperature optimum of 45-65 degrees C, which is similar to values obtained for a beta-1,4-galactanase purified from A. aculeatus. The enzyme degraded unsubstituted galactan to galactose and galactobiose. The deduced primary sequence of the enzyme showed no apparent homology to any known enzyme, in accordance with this being the first reported beta-1,4-galactanase cDNA. However, the deduced amino-acid sequence of a Bacillus circulans DNA sequence containing an open reading frame (ORF) with no known function, showed 36% identity and 60% similarity to the galactanase amino-acid sequence. 
19156406	20090122	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of a beta-1,4-glucosidase from a newly isolated strain of Fomitopsis pinicola.	An efficient beta-1,4-glucosidase (BGL) producing strain, Fomitopsis pinicola KMJ812, was isolated and identified based on morphological features and sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer rDNA. An extracellular BGL was purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography of F. pinicola culture supernatants on a DEAE-sepharose column, a gel filtration column, and then on a Mono Q column with fast protein liquid chromatography. The relative molecular weight of F. pinicola BGL was determined to be 105 kDa by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or 110 kDa by size exclusion chromatography, indicating that the enzyme is a monomer. The hydrolytic activity of the BGL had a pH optimum of 4.5 and a temperature optimum of 50 degrees C. The enzyme showed high substrate specificity and high catalytic efficiency (kcat=2,990 s-1, Km=1.76mM, kcat/Km=1,700 mM-1 s-1) for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside. Its internal amino acid sequences showed a significant homology with hydrolases from glycoside hydrolase family 3, indicating that the F. pinicola BGL is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 3. Although BGLs have been purified and characterized from several other sources, F. pinicola BGL is distinguished from other BGLs by its high catalytic efficiency and strict substrate specificity. 
7586029	19950401	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Cloning and sequencing of cellulase cDNA from Aspergillus kawachii and its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	The cDNA encoding the endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (carboxymethylcellulase; CMCase-I) from Aspergillus kawachii IFO 4308 was cloned. Nucleotide-sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA insert showed a 717-bp open reading frame that encoded a protein of 239 amino-acid residues. The predicted amino-acid sequence of the mature protein had considerable homology with the protein sequence of the FI-CMCase of Aspergillus aculeatus. The cDNA was introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The expressed enzyme had carboxylmethylcellulase activity, identified by clear zones on a CMC-agar plate after Congo Red staining. 
17363438	20070317	Ann._N._Y._Acad._Sci.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding a Coccidioides posadasii 1,2-alpha-mannosidase identified in the coccidioidal T27K vaccine by immunoproteomic methods.	The coccidioidal T27K vaccine is protective in mice against respiratory challenge with Coccidioides posadasii (C. posadasii) arthroconidia. The vaccine is a subcellular multicomponent preparation that has not been fully characterized. To identify potential protective antigens in the heterogeneous mixture, the vaccine has been separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and then analyzed for seroreactive proteins using immunoblot analysis with pooled sera from patients with coccidioidomycosis. Two seroreactive spots of identical apparent molecular weight were identified and sequenced using tandem mass spectrometry. Three peptides were generated, two of which matched a tentative consensus sequence in the TIGR C. posadasii 2.0 gene index database that is similar to fungal 1,2-alpha-mannosidases. The 5' and 3' ends of the mannosidase cDNA were mapped using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and a full-length cDNA was then obtained using reverse-transcription (RT) PCR. The cDNA was cloned and sequenced and expressed as a recombinant protein. The predicted protein consists of 519 amino acids, has a theoretical molecular weight and pI of 56,918 Da and 4.84, respectively, and is very similar (>60%) to other fungal 1,2-alpha-mannosidases. Class I 1,2-alpha-mannosidase enzyme activity was also detected in the T27K vaccine using the substrate, Man-alpha-1,2-Man-alpha-OCH(3) in a spectrophotometric assay. 
1606968	19920615	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and characterization of three chitinases from Trichoderma harzianum.	Three proteins which display chitinase activity were purified from the supernatants of Trichoderma harzianum CECT 2413 grown in minimal medium supplemented with chitin as the sole carbon source. Purification was carried out after protein precipitation with ammonium sulphate, adsorption to colloidal chitin and digestion, and, finally, chromatofocusing. By this procedure, two chitinases of 42 kDa (CHIT42) and 37 kDa (CHIT37) were purified to homogeneity, as judged by SDS/PAGE and gel filtration, whereas a third, of 33 kDa (CHIT33), was highly purified. The isoelectric points for CHIT42, CHIT37 and CHIT33 were 6.2, 4.6 and 7.8, respectively. The three enzymes displayed endochitinase activities and showed different kinetic properties. CHIT33 was able to hydrolyze chitin oligomers of a polymerization degree higher than n = 4, its Km for colloidal chitin being 0.3 mg/ml. CHIT42 and CHIT37 were able to hydrolyze chitin oligomers with a minimal polymerization degree of n = 3, their Km values for colloidal chitin being 1.0 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml respectively. With regard to their lytic activity with purified cell walls of the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea, a hydrolytic action was observed only when CHIT42 was present. Antibodies against CHIT42 and CHIT37 specifically recognized the proteins and did not display cross-reaction, suggesting that each protein is encoded by a different gene.

The deduced amino acid sequence derived from a Macrophomina phaseolina beta-1,4-endoglucanase-encoding gene revealed 48% identity (over 119 amino acids) with egl1 from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas solanacearum. Its similarity to saprophyte endoglucanases was not significant. Its minimum substrate size, unlike that of any known saprophyte endoglucanase, was cellopentaose. The unique characteristics of M. phaseolina egl1-encoded endoglucanase suggest that it is phytopathogen specific. 
2116499	19900501	J._Gen._Microbiol.	D003160 D016428 	Comparison of two glucoamylases from Hormoconis resinae.	Two extracellular glucoamylases (EC 3.2.1.3), glucoamylase P and glucoamylase S, were purified to homogeneity from the culture medium of Hormoconis resinae (ATCC 20495; formerly Cladosporium resinae) by a new method. Their apparent molecular masses (71 kDa glucoamylase P; 78 kDa glucoamylase S) and catalytic properties agreed well with those previously reported in the literature. Heat inactivation studies suggested that the high debranching (1,6-glycosidic) activity of glucoamylase P preparations (measured with pullulan) may reside in the same protein molecule as its 1,4-glycosidic activity (measured with soluble starch). Although glucoamylase S had virtually no debranching activity, it cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies raised against glucoamylase P, and the two enzymes had very similar amino acid compositions. However, peptide mapping and amino-terminal sequencing studies of the peptides showed that the two enzymes have different sequences and must be encoded by different genes. 
22940311	20120904	Bioresour._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Cell surface engineering of α-l-rhamnosidase for naringin hydrolysis.	An α-l-rhamnosidase gene (rhaL1) containing an open reading frame of 2046-bp encoding a 681-amino acid protein (RhaL1) was cloned from Alternaria sp. L1 for naringin hydrolysis on the cell surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY-100. RhaL1 anchored to the yeast cell surface showed maximum enzyme activity at pH 6.0-6.5 and 70°C and was stable at pH 2.5-12.0 below 60°C. When the yeast cells were employed to hydrolyze naringin in grapefruit juice, about 85% naringin was hydrolyzed at 60°C in 10min. The yeast cells were harvested and recycled for the next batch. The hydrolysis rate of the naringin was maintained at over 80% for 10 batches. These results demonstrate the stability of the RhaL1-expressing yeast cells and effective in hydrolysis of naringin in juice. Thus, the system could have promise for industrial bitterness reduction.

S-2: purification, characterization and improvement of its recombinant enzyme production by high cell-density fermentation of Pichia pastoris.	The extracellular carboxymethyl cellulase (CSCMCase) from the yeast, Cryptococcus sp. S-2, was produced when grown on cellobiose. It was purified to homogeneity from the supernatant by ultrafiltration, DEAE-5PW anion exchange column and TSK-Gel G3000SW gel filtration. The purified enzyme was monomeric protein with molecular mass of approximately 34kDa. The optimum temperature and pH for the action of the enzyme were at 40-50 degrees C and 3.5, respectively. It was stable at pH range of 5.5-7.5 and retained approximately 50% of its maximum activity after incubating at 90 degrees C for 1h. Moreover, it could able to hydrolyze carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt higher than insoluble cellulose substrate such as Avicel, SIGMACELL and CM cellulose. Due to its action at acidic pH and moderately stable at high temperature, the gene encoding carboxymethyl cellulase (CSCMCase) was isolated and improved the enzyme yield by high cell-density fermentation of Pichia pastoris. The CSCMCase cDNA contains 1023 nucleotides and encodes a 341-amino acid. It was successfully expressed under the control of alcohol oxidase I promoter using methanol induction of P. pastoris fermentation in a 2L ABLE bioreactor. The production of the recombinant carboxymethyl cellulases was higher than that from Cryptococcus sp. S-2 of 657-fold (2.75 and 4.2 x 10(-3) mg protein L(-1), respectively) indicating that the leader sequence of CSCMCase has been recognized and processed as efficiently by P. pastoris. Furthermore, the recombinant enzyme was purified in two-step of ultrafiltration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography which would be much more convenient for large-scale purification for successful industrial application. 
22395908	20120308	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Transcriptional analysis of Pleurotus ostreatus laccase genes.	Fungal laccases (p-diphenol:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.2) are multi-copper-containing oxidases that catalyse the oxidation of a great variety of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines through simultaneous reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Fungi generally produce several laccase isoenzymes encoded by complex multi-gene families. The Pleurotus ostreatus genome encodes 11 putative laccase coding genes, and only six different laccase isoenzymes have been isolated and characterised so far. Laccase expression was found to be regulated by culture conditions and developmental stages even if the redundancy of these genes still raises the question about their respective functions in vivo. In this context, laccase transcript profiling analysis has been used to unravel the physiological role played by the different isoforms produced by P. ostreatus. Even if reported results depict a complex picture of the transcriptional responses exhibited by the analysed laccase genes, they were allowed to speculate on the isoform role in vivo. Among the produced laccases, LACC10 (POXC) seems to play a major role during vegetative growth, since its transcription is downregulated when the fungus starts the fructification process. Furthermore, a new tessera has been added to the puzzling mosaic of the heterodimeric laccase LACC2 (POXA3). LACC2 small subunit seems to play an additional physiological role during fructification, beside that of LACC2 complex activation/stabilisation.

D016428 	Production and characterization of cellulolytic enzymes from the thermoacidophilic fungal Aspergillus terreus M11 under solid-state cultivation of corn stover.	The production of extracellular cellulases by a newly isolated thermoacidophilic fungus, Aspergillus terreus M11, on the lignocellulosic materials was studied in solid-state fermentation (SSF). The results showed that the high-level cellulase activity was produced at 45 degrees C pH 3 and moisture 80% with corn stover and 0.8% yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen sources. 581 U endoglucanase activity, 243 U filter paper activity and 128 U beta-glucosidase activity per gram of carbon source were obtained in the optimal condition. Endoglucanase and beta-glucosidase exhibited their maximum activity at pH 2 and pH 3, respectively, and both of them showed remarkable stability in the range of pH 2-5. The activities of endoglucanase and beta-glucosidase were up to the maximum at 70 degrees C and maintained about 65% and 53% of their original activities after incubation at 70 degrees C for 6h. The enzyme preparations from this strain were used to hydrolyze Avicel. Higher hydrolysis yields of Avicel were up to 63% on 5% Avicel (w/v) for 72 h with 20 U FPase/g substrate.

The newly discovered fungal species  Aspergillus saccharolyticus  was found to produce a culture broth rich in β-glucosidase activity. In this present work, the main β-glucosidase of A. saccharolyticus responsible for the efficient hydrolytic activity was identified, isolated, and characterized. Ion exchange chromatography was used to fractionate the culture broth, yielding fractions with high β-glucosidase activity and only 1 visible band on an SDS-PAGE gel. Mass spectrometry analysis of this band gave peptide matches to β-glucosidases from aspergilli. Through a polymerase chain reaction approach using degenerate primers and genome walking, a 2919 bp sequence encoding the 860 amino acid BGL1 polypeptide was determined. BGL1 of A. saccharolyticus has 91% and 82% identity with BGL1 from  Aspergillus aculeatus  and BGL1 from  Aspergillus niger , respectively, both belonging to Glycoside Hydrolase family 3. Homology modeling studies suggested β-glucosidase activity with preserved retaining mechanism and a wider catalytic pocket compared with other β-glucosidases. The bgl1 gene was heterologously expressed in  Trichoderma reesei  QM6a, purified, and characterized by enzyme kinetics studies. The enzyme can hydrolyze cellobiose, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside, and cellodextrins. The enzyme showed good thermostability, was stable at 50 °C, and at 60 °C it had a half-life of approximately 6 h. 
8057846	19940401	Mol._Microbiol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Differential expression of multiple exo-cellobiohydrolase I-like genes in the lignin-degrading fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	The genome of Phanerochaete chrysosporium strain ME446 contains multiple, non-allelic, cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI)-like sequences, at least two of which are expressed in a cellulose-dependent manner. Each of the expressed genes contains two identically positioned introns within its coding region. The lengths and sequences of these introns are different and one is not excised from all transcripts, raising the possibility that subtly different protein products may be expressed from a common gene. Introns are also present upstream of both genes but these differ in number and position, as well as sequence and length. Endoglucanase-like sequences could not be identified and it is suggested that variant CBHI-like proteins may provide endoglucanase activity in this fungus. 
16431275	20060125	Mycol._Res.	D016428 	The three beta-1,3-glucanases from Acremonium blochii strain C59 appear to be encoded by separate genes.	Three exocellular beta-1,3-glucanases from Acremonium blochii strain C59, BGN3.2, BGN3.3 and BGN3.4, were purified. Two, BGN3.2 and BGN3.4 appeared to act as exo-enzymes against laminarin from Laminaria digitata, while BGN3.3 displayed an endo-mode of action. The N-terminal amino acid sequence data for BGN3.2 and BGN3.4 suggested these two enzymes may be encoded by different genes. The gene encoding the BGN3.2 glucanase was fully sequenced, and its deduced amino acid sequence was similar to those for all other sequenced fungal exo-beta-1,3-glucanases. This BGN3.2 gene consists of an uninterrupted ORF of 2349 bp encoding 783 amino acids possibly with two cleavage sites for the potential removal of a pre- and pro-protein, respectively. A DNA fragment encoding a portion of the BGN3.4 gene was amplified by PCR, and the nucleotide sequence of this fragment confirmed that BGN3.2 and BGN3.4 are encoded by different genes. The internal peptide sequences of BGN3.3 were not present in the amino acid sequence deduced from the BGN3.2 gene, reinforcing the view that BGN3.3 is also genetically different to BGN3.2. Genetic differences between multiple forms of fungal beta-1,3-glucanases from a single fungus have not been reported previously.

Degenerate PCR primers corresponding to conserved domains of fungal chitinases were designed, and PCR was performed on genomic DNA of the entomogenous fungus Verticillium lecanii (Zimmermann) Viegas. Two distinct PCR fragments, chf1 and chf2, were isolated and used to identify two DNA contigs. Analyses of these two contigs revealed that we had obtained the full-length DNA sequence including the promoter, 5' untranslated region, open reading frame (ORF), and 3' untranslated regions for two distinct chitinase-like genes. These two genomic DNA sequences exhibited 51% identity at the amino acid (aa) level and were designed as acidic (chi1) and basic (chi2) chitinase-like genes. The isolated cDNA for chi1 gene is 1110 bp with a predicted protein of 370 aa and molecular mass of 40.93 kDa, and its ORF was uninterrupted in its corresponding genomic DNA sequence. The cDNA for the chi2 gene is 1269 bp, a predicted ORF of 423 aa and molecular mass of 45.95 kDa. In contrast, the ORF was interrupted by three introns in its corresponding genomic DNA. The basic chitinase gene (chi2) was successfully expressed in the Pichia pastoris system; optimum enzymatic activity was observed at 22 degrees C and at pH 7.5. CHI1 and CHI2 were clustered into two different phylogenetic groups according to their sequence alignments with 28 other fungal chitinases. A chitin-binding domain, comprising two sub-domains that exhibit similarities at the aa level to chitin binding domains in bacteria, was identified in 30 fungal chitinase sequences examined. 
8190078	19940510	Mol._Gen._Genet.	D016428 	A novel method for efficient expression cloning of fungal enzyme genes.	We have developed a method for fast and efficient isolation of enzyme genes from filamentous fungi by combining the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to express heterologous genes with the utilisation of sensitive and reliable enzyme assays. A cDNA library from the fungus Humicola insolens was constructed in a S. cerevisiae/Escherichia coli shuttle vector in E. coli. Sub-pools of the library were subsequently screened for enzyme activity in S. cerevisiae. More than 130 clones were identified as positive in either an endo-beta-glucanase or an endo-xylanase assay. Based on a partial characterization of the DNA sequence of the individual clones, they could be grouped into five distinct types of endo-beta-glucanases and three types of endo-xylanases. A representative cDNA from each type was sub-cloned in an Aspergillus vector and expressed in A. oryzae. The new cloning method may be an important alternative to traditional cloning methods based on amino acid sequence information. 
8647081	19960415	Eur._J._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Purification and catalytic properties of two manganese peroxidase isoenzymes from Pleurotus eryngii.	The ligninolytic basidiomycetes Pleurotus eryngii, Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus pulmonarius and Pleurotus sajor-caju did not exhibit detectable levels of manganese peroxidase (MP) when grown in liquid media with ammonium tartrate as N source. However, after examination of cells grown on different organic N-based media, high MP activity was obtained in peptone medium, up to nearly 3 U/ml in cultures of P. eryngii. Moreover, Mn2+ supplementation was not used to produce MP, since all Mn2+ concentrations assayed (1-4000 microM) inhibited production of this enzyme in liquid medium. Two MP isoenzymes were purified to homogeneity from shaken or stationary cultures of P. eryngii grown in peptone medium. The purification process (which included chromatography on Biorad Q-cartridge, Sephacryl S-200 and Mono-Q) attained 56% activity yield with a purification factor of 25. The isoenzymes differed in pI (3.75 and 3.65), N-terminal sequence and some catalytic properties. They were in some aspects (e.g, molecular mass of 43 kDa) similar to Phanerochaete chrysosporium MP but exhibited some distinct characteristics, including Mn(2+)-independent peroxidase activities against 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and veratryl alcohol, and higher resistance to H2O2. Recent studies have shown that MP are ubiquitous enzymes in ligninolytic fungi, but the results obtained suggest that differences in catalytic properties probably exist between different Mn(2+)-oxidizing peroxidases produced by these fungi.

Three specific xyloglucanases (XGs) were isolated from Aspergillus japonicus (32 kDa, pI 2.8), Chrysosporium lucknowense (78 kDa, pI 3.8) and Trichoderma reesei (75-105 kDa, pI 4.1-4.3). The characteristic feature of these enzymes was their high specific activity toward tamarind xyloglucan, whereas the activity against carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and barley beta-glucan was absent or very low. Peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed that the T. reesei XG represents Cel74A, whose gene has been discovered recently (GenBank accession no. AY281371 ), but the enzyme has not been characterized and described elsewhere. Tryptic peptides from A. japonicus and C. lucknowense xyloglucanases did not show any identity to those from known glycoside hydrolases. All enzymes produced XXXG, XXLG/XLXG and XLLG oligosaccharides as the end products of xyloglucan hydrolysis. A. japonicus XG displayed an endo-type of attack on the polymeric substrate, while the mode of action of two other xyloglucanases was similar to the exo-type, when oligosaccharides containing four glucose residues in the main chain were split off the ends of xyloglucan molecules. These results together with growing literature data allow concluding that specific xyloglucanases may represent a new class of glycoside hydrolases, which are different from regular endo-1,4-beta-glucanases. 
17381511	20070327	FEBS_J.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of the bga1-encoded glycoside hydrolase family 35 beta-galactosidase of Hypocrea jecorina with galacto-beta-D-galactanase activity.	The extracellular bga1-encoded beta-galactosidase of Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) was overexpressed under the pyruvat kinase (pki1) promoter region and purified to apparent homogeneity. The monomeric enzyme is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 118.8 +/- 0.5 kDa (MALDI-MS) and an isoelectric point of 6.6. Bga1 is active with several disaccharides, e.g. lactose, lactulose and galactobiose, as well as with aryl- and alkyl-beta-D-galactosides. Based on the catalytic efficiencies, lactitol and lactobionic acid are the poorest substrates and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside and lactulose are the best. The pH optimum for the hydrolysis of galactosides is approximately 5.0, and the optimum temperature was found to be 60 degrees C. Bga1 is also capable of releasing D-galactose from beta-galactans and is thus actually a galacto-beta-D-galactanase. beta-Galactosidase is inhibited by its reaction product D-galactose and the enzyme also shows a significant transferase activity which results in the formation of galacto-oligosaccharides. 
3758030	19860801	EMBO_J.	D016428 D013485 	The killer toxin of Kluyveromyces lactis: characterization of the toxin subunits and identification of the genes which encode them.	The killer character of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis is associated with the presence of the linear DNA plasmids k1 and k2 and results from the secretion of a protein toxin into the growth medium. We find that toxin activity co-purifies with three polypeptides which we have termed the alpha- (mol. wt 99,000), beta- (mol. wt 30,000) and gamma- (mol. wt 27,500) subunits. The alpha-subunit appears to contain a single asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chain but neither of the smaller subunits is glycosylated. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of each subunit has been determined. Comparison of these data with the DNA sequence of plasmid k1 indicates that it encodes all three subunits. The alpha- and beta-subunits must be processed from the primary translation product of a single gene by an enzyme related to the KEX2 endopeptidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
17625262	20070713	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and properties of a beta-galactosidase with potential application as a digestive supplement.	Functional-based screening of crude beta-galactosidase activities from 42 yeast strains resulted in the selection of a single enzyme of potential interest as a digestive supplement. beta-Galactosidase produced by Kluyveromyces marxianus DSM5418 was purified to homogeneity by a combination of gel filtration, ion-exchange, and hydroxylapatite chromatographies. The denatured (123 kDa) and native molecular masses (251 kDa) suggest that the enzyme is a homodimer. The optimum pH and temperature of the purified enzyme were 6.8 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The unpurified beta-galactosidase in particular displayed a high level of stability when exposed to simulated intestinal conditions in vitro for 4 h. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass sectrometry analysis revealed that the enzyme's trypsin-generated peptide mass fingerprint shares several peptide fragment hits with beta-galactosidases from Kluyveromyces lactis. This confirms the enzyme's identity and indicates that significant sequence homology exists between these enzymes. 
9324248	19971027	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Sequencing of a 1,3-1,4-beta-D-glucanase (lichenase) from the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces strain PC-2: properties of the enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli and evidence that the gene has a bacterial origin.	A 971-bp cDNA, designated licA, was obtained from a library of Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2 constructed in Escherichia coli. It had an open reading frame of 738 nucleotides encoding LicA (1,3-1,4-beta-D-glucanase; lichenase) (EC 3.2.1.73) of 245 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 27,929 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence had high homology with bacterial beta-glucanases, particularly in the central regions and toward the C-terminal halves of bacterial enzymes. LicA had no homology with plant beta-glucanases. The genomic DNA region coding for LicA was devoid of introns. More than 95% of the recombinant beta-glucanase produced in E. coli cells was found in the culture medium and periplasmic space. A N-terminal signal peptide of 29 amino residues was cleaved from the enzyme secreted from Orpinomyces, whereas 21 amino acid residues of the signal peptide were removed when the enzyme was produced by E. coli. The beta-glucanase produced by E. coli was purified from the culture medium. It had a molecular mass of 27 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The Km and Vmax values with lichenin as the substrate at pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C were 0.75 mg/ml and 3,790 micromol/min/mg, respectively. With barley beta-glucan as the substrate, the corresponding values were 0.91 mg/ml and 5,320 micromol/min/mg. This enzyme did not hydrolyze laminarin, carboxymethylcellulose, pustulan, or xylan. The main products of lichenin and barley beta-glucan hydrolysis were triose and tetraose. LicA represented the first 1,3-1,4-beta-D-glucanase reported from fungi. The results presented suggest that licA of Orpinomyces had a bacterial origin. 
8598062	19960301	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Secretion of an enzymatically active Trichoderma harzianum endochitinase by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	A novel endochitinase agar-plate assay has been developed and used to identify 11 full-length cDNAs encoding endochitinase I (ENCI) from a Trichoderma harzianum cDNA library by expression in yeast. The 1473-bp chi1 cDNA encodes a 424-residue precursor protein including both a signal sequence and a propeptide. The deduced ENCI amino-acid sequence is homologous to other fungal and bacterial chitinases, and the enzyme cross-reacts with a polyclonal antiserum raised against chitinase A1 from Bacillus circulans. The T. harzianum endochitinase I was secreted into the culture medium by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a functionally active form. The purified recombinant enzyme had a molecular mass of 44 kDa, an isoelectric point of 6.3, a pH optimum of 7.0 and a temperature optimum of 20 degrees C. 
7489898	19951107	Gene	D016428 	Cloning and sequencing of the beta-glucosidase-encoding gene from Candida molischiana strain 35M5N.	We have isolated a gene (bgln) encoding beta-glucosidase (beta Glu) from a cosmid library of the yeast, Candida molischiana 35M5N. The nucleotide sequence of bgln and its flanking regions was determined. This gene was found to be composed of 2289 bp and 763 amino acid (aa) residues encoding an 83.3-kDa protein. The aa sequence shared eleven putative N-glycosylation sites. Homology comparisons showed that this enzyme can be considered as a new member of the family-3 glycosyl hydrolases. Multiple alignment experiments revealed four conserved regions on aa sequences from beta Glu of this family. 
9535817	19980516	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and characterization of an invertase and its repressor genes from Schizosaccharomyces pombe.	PCR was used to isolate an invertase homolog gene from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The cloned inv1(+) gene encodes a protein of 581 amino acids with 16 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites, and has 39% and 38% identity to the Schwanniomyces occidentalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUC2 invertases. When the inv1(+) gene was disrupted, S. pombe strains lacked detectable invertase activity. This result showed that the inv1(+) gene encodes only one active invertase in S. pombe cells. The transcription of inv1(+) is repressed in the presence of glucose. The transcription of inv1(+) was not affected in cyr1Delta strain which lacks adenylate cyclase activity, unlike transcription of S. pombe fbp1(+) gene. We have identified an S. pombe gene (scr1(+)) that encodes a homolog of the Aspergillus nidulans CREA which is required for glucose repression of the glyconeogenic pathway. Although the deletion of scr1(+) did not influence the transcription of fbp1(+) gene, glucose repression of the inv1(+) gene was severely affected. These results showed that glucose repression of inv1(+) gene is dependent on scr1(+) gene, and S. pombe cAMP signalling pathway may not be essential for glucose repression of inv1(+) gene. 
21710260	20110629	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Recombinant expression, activity screening and functional characterization identifies three novel endo-1,4-β-glucanases that efficiently hydrolyse cellulosic substrates.	The hydrolysis of cellulose into fermentable sugars is a costly and rate-limiting step in the production of biofuels from renewable feedstocks. Developing new cellulase systems capable of increased cellulose hydrolysis rates would reduce biofuel production costs. With this in mind, we screened 55 fungal endoglucanases for their abilities to be expressed at high levels by Aspergillus niger and to hydrolyze amorphous cellulose at rates significantly greater than that obtained with TrCel5A, one of the major endoglucanases in the Trichoderma reesei cellulase system. This screen identified three endoglucanases, Aureobasidium pullulans ApCel5A, Gloeophyllum trabeum GtCel12A and Sporotrichum thermophile StCel5A. We determined that A. niger expressed the three endoglucanases at relatively high levels (≥0.3 g/l) and that the hydrolysis rate of ApCel5A and StCel5A with carboxymethylcellulose 4M as substrate was five and two times greater than the T. reesei Cel5A. The ApCel5A, GtCel12A and StCel5A enzymes also demonstrated significant synergy with Cel7A/CbhI, the major exoglucanase in the T. reesei cellulase system. The three endoglucanases characterized in this study are, therefore, promising candidate endoglucanases for developing new cellulase systems with increased rates of cellulose saccharification. 
9987124	19990213	Mol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular characterization of a novel peroxidase isolated from the ligninolytic fungus Pleurotus eryngii.	A haem peroxidase different from other microbial, plant and animal peroxidases is described. The enzyme is secreted as two isoforms by dikaryotic Pleurotus eryngii in peptone-containing liquid medium. The corresponding gene, which presents 15 introns and encodes a 361-amino-acid protein with a 30-amino-acid signal peptide, was isolated as two alleles corresponding to the two isoforms. The alleles differ in three amino acid residues and in a seven nucleotide deletion affecting a single metal response element in the promoter. When compared with Phanerochaete chrysosporium peroxidases, the new enzyme appears closer to lignin peroxidase (LiP) than to Mn-dependent peroxidase (MnP) isoenzymes (58-60% and 55% identity respectively). The molecular model built using crystal structures of three fungal peroxidases as templates, also showed high structural affinity with LiP (C alpha-distance 1.2 A). However, this peroxidase includes a Mn2+ binding site formed by three acidic residues (E36, E40 and D175) near the haem internal propionate, which accounts for the ability to oxidize Mn2+. Its capability to oxidize aromatic substrates could involve interactions with aromatic residues at the edge of the haem channel. Another possibility is long-range electron transfer, e.g. from W164, which occupies the same position of LiP W171 recently reported as involved in the catalytic cycle of LiP. 
23199985	20121204	Food_Chem	D023362 D016428 D013485 	Encapsulation of ligninolytic enzymes and its application in clarification of juice.	The thermal stability, physico-chemical properties and effect on juice clarification of hydrogel formulations of ligninolytic enzymes from Phanerochaete chrysosporium were evaluated. The results showed that enzyme entrapment increase significantly (P<0.05) the thermal stability of enzymes at 4 and 75 °C. At 75 °C, maximum activity decreased to non detectable values of 7.9% for free laccase, manganese peroxidase (MnP), lignin peroxidase (LiP), respectively; to 94%, 97%, 93% for laccase, MnP and LiP entrapped into Polyacrylamide/pectin, 94%, 98%, 88% for laccase, MnP and LiP encapsulated respectively into polyacrylamide/ gelatine and to 87%, 91%, 87% for laccase, MnP and LiP entrapped, respectively into polyacrylamide/carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). When particle size and viscosity of the formulation increased, enzyme stability increased. The polyphenolic reduction and clarity amelioration in mixed juice of berry and pomegranate was more significant (p>0.05) using encapsulated enzymes treatment than free enzymes. This suggested that enzymatic treatment was efficient for the juice clarification. 
18935968	20081022	Fungal_Genet._Biol.	D016428 	Identification, biochemical characterization, and evolution of the Rhizopus oryzae 99-880 polygalacturonase gene family.	A search of the recently sequenced Rhizopus oryzae strain 99-880 genome database uncovered 18 putative polygalacturonase genes with two genes being identical and only one with similarity to a previously reported R. oryzae polygalacturonase gene. The 17 different genes share 50% to greater than 90% identity at the nucleotide level as well as the deduced protein sequence level. The cDNA of the different genes was isolated directly or recombinantly and used to express the encoded proteins in Pichia pastoris. Recombinant protein expression demonstrated that 15 of the 17 genes encode active enzymes with twelve genes encoding for endo-polygalacturonase enzymes and three genes encoding for exo-polygalacturonase enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the genes form a distinct monophyletic group among fungal polygalacturonase enzymes. Finally, our results also suggest that the ancestral form of polygalacturonase in fungi is endolytic and exolytic function evolved later, at least two independent times. 
16329166	20051206	DNA_Seq.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of xylanase 10 from Cryptovalsa mangrovei (BCC7197) in Pichia pastoris.	Xylanases are one of the industrially valuable enzymes. Using RT-PCR and 5'- and 3'-RACE procedures, we have cloned a full-length xylanase encoding gene from a filamentous fungus, Cryptovalsa mangrovei (BCC7197) from Phuket, Thailand. The results showed that BCC7197 xylanase cDNA has an open reading frame of 978 bp encoding 325 amino acid residues. Further sequence analysis revealed that this xylanase gene is belonged to the glycosyl hydrolase family 10 and has approximately 50-60% amino acid sequence similarity to other fungal xylanases. Furthermore, expression of BCC7197 xylanase in the Pichia pastoris was also performed. The results demonstrated that the active BCC7197 xylanase protein was successfully produced and secreted from P. pastoris.

A periplasmic invertase from the yeast Candida utilis was purified to homogeneity from cells fully derepressed for invertase synthesis. The enzyme was purified by successive Sephacryl S-300, and affinity chromatography and shown to be a dimeric glycoprotein composed of two identical monomer subunits with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa. After EndoH treatment, the deglycosylated protein showed an apparent molecular weight of 60 kDa. The apparent K(m) values for sucrose and raffinose were 11 and 150 mM, respectively, similar to those reported in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The range of optimum temperature was 60-75 degrees C. The optimum pH was 5.5 and the enzyme was stable over pH range 3-6. 
8900004	19961101	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013486 	Cloning, disruption, and expression of two endo-beta 1, 4-xylanase genes, XYL2 and XYL3, from Cochliobolus carbonum.	In culture, the filamentous fungus Cochliobolus carbonum, a pathogen of maize, makes three cationic xylanases, XYL1, which encodes the major endoxylanase (Xyl1), was earlier cloned and shown by gene disruption to encode the first and second peaks of xylanase activity (P. C. Apel, D. G. Panaccione, F. R. Holden, and J. D. Walton, Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 6:467-473, 1993). Two additional xylanase genes, XYL2 and XYL3, have now been cloned from C. carbonum. XYL2 and XYL3 are predicted to encode 22-kDa family G xylanases similar to Xyl1. Xyl2 and Xyl3 are 60% and 42% identical, respectively, to Xyl1, and Xyl2 and Xyl3 are 39% identical. XYL1 and XYL2 but not XYL3 mRNAs are present in C. carbonum grown in culture, and XYL1 and XYL3 but not XYL2 mRNAs are present in infected plants. Transformation-mediated gene disruption was used to construct strains mutated in XYL1, XYL2, and XYL3. Xyl1 accounts for most of the total xylanase activity in culture, and disruption of XYL2 or XYL3 does not result in the further loss of any xylanase activity. In particular, the third peak of cationic xylanase activity is still present in a xyl1 xyl2 xyl3 triple mutant, and therefore this xylanase must be encoded by yet a fourth xylanase gene. A minor protein of 22 kDa that can be detected immunologically in the xyl1 mutant disappears in the xyl2 mutant and is therefore proposed to be the product of XYL2. The single xylanase mutants were crossed with each other to obtain multiple xylanase disruptions within the same strain. Strains disrupted in combinations of two and in all three xylanases were obtained. The triple mutant grows at the same rate as the wild type on xylan and on maize cell walls. The triple mutant is still fully pathogenic on maize with regard to lesion size, morphology, and rate of lesion development. 
2113524	19900705	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013487 	Identification of an active-site residue in yeast invertase by affinity labeling and site-directed mutagenesis.	Deglycosylated yeast invertase is irreversibly inactivated by conduritol B epoxide (CBE), an active-site-directed reagent. The inactivated enzyme contained 0.8 mol of CBE/mol of invertase monomer suggesting that the inactivation results from the modification of a single amino acid residue. Peptic digestion of [3H]CBE-labeled invertase followed by reverse phase column chromatography yielded two labeled peptides, both located at the amino-terminal end of the enzyme. Sequence analyses of these peptides revealed that Asp-23 is the modified residue. The role of Asp-23 in the catalytic process was investigated by changing it to Asn using site-directed mutagenesis of the SCU2 gene. The mutant enzyme was basically inactive, confirming a role for Asp-23 in the catalytic process. 
1406248	19920801	Mol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Homologous catalytic domains in a rumen fungal xylanase: evidence for gene duplication and prokaryotic origin.	A cDNA (xynA), encoding xylanase A (XYLA), was isolated from a cDNA library, derived from mRNA extracted from the rumen anaerobic fungus, Neocallimastix patriciarum. Recombinant XYLA, purified from Escherichia coli harbouring xynA, had a M(r) of 53,000 and hydrolysed oat-spelt xylan to xylobiose and xylose. The enzyme did not hydrolyse any cellulosic substrates. The nucleotide sequence of xynA revealed a single open reading frame of 1821 bp coding for a protein of M(r) 66,192. The predicted primary structure of XYLA comprised an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a 225-amino-acid repeated sequence, which was separated from a tandem 40-residue C-terminal repeat by a threonine/proline linker sequence. The large N-terminal reiterated regions consisted of distinct catalytic domains which displayed similar substrate specificities to the full-length enzyme. The reiterated structure of XYLA suggests that the enzyme was derived from an ancestral gene which underwent two discrete duplications. Sequence comparison analysis revealed significant homology between XYLA and bacterial xylanases belonging to cellulase/xylanase family G. One of these homologous enzymes is derived from the rumen bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens. The homology observed between XYLA and a rumen prokaryote xylanase could be a consequence of the horizontal transfer of genes between rumen prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, either when the organisms were resident in the rumen, or prior to their colonization of the ruminant. It should also be noted that Neocallimastix XYLA is the first example of a xylanase which consists of reiterated sequences. It remains to be established whether this is a common phenomenon in other rumen fungal plant cell wall hydrolases. 
8346264	19930801	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013486 	Cloning and characterization of cDNA encoding glyoxal oxidase, a H2O2-producing enzyme from the lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	Glyoxal oxidase is produced by ligninolytic cultures of the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium and is a source of the extracellular H2O2 that is required by ligninolytic peroxidases. We report here the cloning and characterization of glx-1c cDNA, which encodes glyoxal oxidase. The deduced mature protein has 537 amino acids, a molecular size of 57 kDa, and a pI of 5.1. Five potential N-glycosylation sites are present. The predicted N-terminal sequence is identical to the experimentally determined sequence of purified enzyme and is preceded by a leader peptide of 22 amino acids. The sequence of glx-1c lacks significant homology with known sequences. Specific comparisons were made between the glx-1c translated sequence and that of galactose oxidase from Dactylium dendroides because of previously observed catalytic similarities of the enzyme. Although no significant homology is observed, in both cases extensive beta-sheet regions are predicted from the primary sequences. Glyoxal oxidase activity correlates with transcript levels and is also coordinate with the lignin peroxidases in nutrient nitrogen-starved cultures. 
23537284	20130330	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	Crystal structures of glycoside hydrolase family 3 β-glucosidase 1 from Aspergillus aculeatus.	GH3 (glycoside hydrolase family 3) BGLs (β-glucosidases) from filamentous fungi have been widely and commercially used for the supplementation of cellulases. AaBGL1 (Aspergillus aculeatus BGL1) belongs to the GH3 and shows high activity towards cellooligosaccharides up to high degree of polymerization. In the present study we determined the crystal structure of AaBGL1. In addition to the substrate-free structure, the structures of complexes with glucose and various inhibitors were determined. The structure of AaBGL1 is highly glycosylated with 88 monosaccharides (18 N-glycan chains) in the dimer. The largest N-glycan chain comprises ten monosaccharides and is one of the largest glycans ever observed in protein crystal structures. A prominent insertion region exists in a fibronectin type III domain, and this region extends to cover a wide surface area of the enzyme. The subsite +1 of AaBGL1 is highly hydrophobic. Three aromatic residues are present at subsite +1 and are located in short loop regions that are uniquely present in this enzyme. There is a long cleft extending from subsite +1, which appears to be suitable for binding long cellooligosaccharides. The crystal structures of AaBGL1 from the present study provide an important structural basis for the technical improvement of enzymatic cellulosic biomass conversion. 
17455791	20070426	Folia_Microbiol._(Praha)	D016428 D013485 	Comparative studies of differential expression of chitinolytic enzymes encoded by chiA, chiB, chiC and nagA genes in Aspergillus nidulans.	N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine, chito-oligomers and carbon starvation regulated chiA, chiB, and nagA gene expressions in Aspergillus nidulans cultures. The gene expression patterns of the main extracellular endochitinase ChiB and the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase NagA were similar, and the ChiB-NagA enzyme system may play a morphological and/or nutritional role during autolysis. Alterations in the levels of reactive oxygen species or in the glutathione-glutathione disulfide redox balance, characteristic physiological changes developing in ageing and autolyzing fungal cultures, did not affect the regulation of either the growth-related chiA or the autolysis-coupled chiB genes although both of them were down-regulated under diamide stress. The transcription of the chiC gene with unknown physiological function was repressed by increased intracellular superoxide concentration.

D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of extracellular inulinase from a marine yeast Cryptococcus aureus G7a and inulin hydrolysis by the purified inulinase.	The extracellular inulinase in the supernatant of the cell culture of the marine yeast Cryptococcus aureus G7a was purified to homogeneity with a 7.2-fold increase in specific inulinase activity compared to that in the supernatant by ultrafiltration, concentration, gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G-75), and anion exchange chromatography (DEAE sepharose fast flow anion exchange). The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 60.0 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified enzyme were 5.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was activated by Ca2+, K+, Na+, Fe2+, and Zn2+. However, Mg2+, Hg2+, and Ag+ acted as inhibitors in decreasing the activity of the purified inulinase. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), iodoacetic acid, EDTA, and 1,10-phenanthroline. The K(m) and Vmax values of the purified enzyme for inulin were 20.06 mg/ml and 0.0085 mg/min, respectively. A large amount of monosaccharides were detected after the hydrolysis of inulin with the purified inulinase, indicating the purified inulinase had a high exoinulinase activity. 
11872475	20020302	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Novel alpha-glucosidase from Aspergillus nidulans with strong transglycosylation activity.	Aspergillus nidulans possessed an alpha-glucosidase with strong transglycosylation activity. The enzyme, designated alpha-glucosidase B (AgdB), was purified and characterized. AgdB was a heterodimeric protein comprising 74- and 55-kDa subunits and catalyzed hydrolysis of maltose along with formation of isomaltose and panose. Approximately 50% of maltose was converted to isomaltose, panose, and other minor transglycosylation products by AgdB, even at low maltose concentrations. The agdB gene was cloned and sequenced. The gene comprised 3,055 bp, interrupted by three short introns, and encoded a polypeptide of 955 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contained the chemically determined N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of the 74- and 55-kDa subunits. This implies that AgdB is synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor. AgdB showed low but overall sequence homology to alpha-glucosidases of glycosyl hydrolase family 31. However, AgdB was phylogenetically distinct from any other alpha-glucosidases. We propose here that AgdB is a novel alpha-glucosidase with unusually strong transglycosylation activity.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of one of the fragments showed high identity with fungal glycoside hydrolase family 15 glucoamylases. As its kinetic efficiency increased in proportion to the degree of polymerization of the substrate, the protein was identified as a glucoamylase. A cDNA encoding the glucoamylase (gla) was cloned by reverse transcriptase PCR. 
23285046	20130104	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Release of Pleurotus ostreatus versatile-peroxidase from Mn2+ repression enhances anthropogenic and natural substrate degradation.	The versatile-peroxidase (VP) encoded by mnp4 is one of the nine members of the manganese-peroxidase (MnP) gene family that constitutes part of the ligninolytic system of the white-rot basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom). VP enzymes exhibit dual activity on a wide range of substrates. As Mn(2+) supplement to P. ostreatus cultures results in enhanced degradation of recalcitrant compounds and lignin, we examined the effect of Mn(2+) on the expression profile of the MnP gene family. In P. ostreatus (monokaryon PC9), mnp4 was found to be the predominantly expressed mnp in Mn(2+)-deficient media, whereas strongly repressed (to approximately 1%) in Mn(2+)-supplemented media. Accordingly, in-vitro Mn(2+)-independent activity was found to be negligible. We tested whether release of mnp4 from Mn(2+) repression alters the activity of the ligninolytic system. A transformant over-expressing mnp4 (designated OEmnp4) under the control of the β-tubulin promoter was produced. Now, despite the presence of Mn(2+) in the medium, OEmnp4 produced mnp4 transcript as well as VP activity as early as 4 days after inoculation. The level of expression was constant throughout 10 days of incubation (about 0.4-fold relative to β-tubulin) and the activity was comparable to the typical activity of PC9 in Mn(2+)-deficient media. In-vivo decolorization of the azo dyes Orange II, Reactive Black 5, and Amaranth by OEmnp4 preceded that of PC9. OEmnp4 and PC9 were grown for 2 weeks under solid-state fermentation conditions on cotton stalks as a lignocellulosic substrate. [(14)C]-lignin mineralization, in-vitro dry matter digestibility, and neutral detergent fiber digestibility were found to be significantly higher (about 25%) in OEmnp4-fermented substrate, relative to PC9. We conclude that releasing Mn(2+) suppression of VP4 by over-expression of the mnp4 gene in P. ostreatus improved its ligninolytic functionality. 
1398098	19921001	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and characterization of a cellulose-growth-specific gene from Agaricus bisporus.	The edible basidiomycete, Agaricus bisporus, produces extracellular endoglucanase. Endoglucanase production is induced by cellulose and repressed by fructose in A. bisporus grown on minimal medium, and is regulated in activity during fruiting body development. An anti-endoglucanase antibody was used to isolate cellulase-related genes. Three main polypeptides of 38, 58, and 60 kDa were immunoprecipitated by the antibody from products of in vitro cell-free translation of mRNAs isolated from cellulose-grown mycelium. No cross-reaction was detected with the translated products from fructose-grown mycelium. This antibody was used to immunoscreen a lambda ZAPII-cDNA expression library made from mRNA isolated from cellulose-grown mycelium. Two cDNA cross-reacting clones, pSRc110 and pSRc200, were isolated. Clones pSRc110 and pSRc200 cross-hybridized and had the same restriction map. Clone pSRc200 hybrid selected an mRNA that on cell-free translation produced a 38-kDa polypeptide. The cDNA fragment from pSRc200 hybridized to a 1.3-kb mRNA from cellulose-grown mycelium. No hybridization was observed when using fructose-grown mycelium mRNA. Thus, the gene (cel1) expressing the 1.3-kb mRNA, is differentially regulated by the carbon source of the culture medium. The cell gene was isolated in a 8.9-kb EcoRI genomic fragment after hybridization to pSRc200. Sequences similar to those in the egl1 and cbh2 genes from Trichoderma reesi were found upstream from the ATG start codon in cel1. Nine short intervening sequences disrupt the cel1 coding sequence, and a strong bias against codons ending with G and A was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

D016428 D013486 	Phanerochaete chrysosporium glyoxal oxidase is encoded by two allelic variants: structure, genomic organization, and heterologous expression of glx1 and glx2.	A cDNA clone (glx-2c) encoding glyoxal oxidase (GLOX) was isolated from a Phanerochaete chrysosporium lambda gt11 library, and its nucleotide sequence was shown to be distinct from that of the previously described clone glx-1c (P. J. Kersten and D. Cullen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:7411-7413, 1993). Genomic clones corresponding to both cDNAs were also isolated and sequenced. overall nucleotide sequence identity was 98%, and the predicted proteins differed by a single residue: Lys-308<==>Thr-308. Analyses of parental dikaryotic strain BKM-F-1767 and homokaryotic progeny firmly established allelism for these structural variants. Southern blots of pulsed-field gels localized the GLOX gene (glx) to a dimorphic chromosome separate from the peroxidase and cellobiohydrolase genes of P. chrysosporium. Controlled expression of active GLOX was obtained from Aspergillus nidulans transformants when glx-1c was fused to the promoter and secretion signal of the A. niger glucoamylase gene. The GLOX isozyme corresponding to glx-2c was also efficiently secreted by A. nidulans following site-specific mutagenesis of the expression vector at codon 308 of glx-1c. 
18725302	20080830	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Expression of a Trichoderma reesei beta-xylanase gene in Escherichia coli and activity of the enzyme on fiber-bound substrates.	A recombinant gene Xyn2 (570bp) encoding the main Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 endo-beta-1,4-xylanase was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 under the control of strong bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals. The molecular weight of the recombinant protein was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 24 kDa. The expressed protein was purified by Ni(2+)-NTA affinity chromatography and enzyme activity assay verified the protein as a xylanase. Like with the T. reesei Xyn2, the optimal activity of the recombinant Xyn2 was at 50 degrees C. However, the recombinant xylanase had an improved thermostability and more than 70% of its activity remained after 30 min incubation at 60 degrees C. In addition, the recombinant xylanase was active over the range of pH 3.5-7.5 with maximum activity at pH 5.0. The enzyme was highly specific towards xylans but exhibited very low activities towards cellulosic substrates. Using Birchwood xylan, the determined apparent K(m) and k(cat) values were 0.11 mg/ml and 106 s(-1), respectively. These properties should make the enzyme an attractive candidate for various industrial applications. 
21490699	20110415	Enzyme_Res	D016428 	Biochemical and Structural Characterization of Amy1: An Alpha-Amylase from Cryptococcus flavus Expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	An extracellular alpha-amylase (Amy1) whose gene from Cryptococcus flavus was previously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified to homogeneity (67 kDa) by ion-exchange and molecular exclusion chromatography. The enzyme was activated by NH(4) (+) and inhibited by Cu(+2) and Hg(+2). Significant biochemical and structural discrepancies between wild-type and recombinant α-amylase with respect to K(m) values, enzyme specificity, and secondary structure content were found. Far-UV CD spectra analysis at pH 7.0 revealed the high thermal stability of both proteins and the difference in folding pattern of Amy1 compared with wild-type amylase from C. flavus, which reflected in decrease (10-fold) of enzymatic activity of recombinant protein. Despite the differences, the highest activity of Amy1 towards soluble starch, amylopectin, and amylase, in contrast with the lowest activity of Amy1(w), points to this protein as being of paramount biotechnological importance with many applications ranging from food industry to the production of biofuels. 
16474906	20060214	Acta_Biochim._Biophys._Sin._(Shanghai)	D016428 D013485 	Novel cold-adaptive Penicillium strain FS010 secreting thermo-labile xylanase isolated from Yellow Sea.	A novel cold-adaptive xylanolytic Penicillium strain FS010 was isolated from Yellow sea sediments. The marine fungus grew well from 4 to 20 degrees; a lower (0 degrees) or higher (37 degrees) temperature limits its growth. The strain was identified as Penicillium chrysogenum. Compared with mesophilic P. chrysogenum, the cold-adaptive fungus secreted the cold-active xylanase (XYL) showing high hydrolytic activities at low temperature (2-15 degrees) and high sensitivity to high temperature (>50 degrees). The XYL gene was isolated from the cold-adaptive P. chrysogenum FS010 and designated as xyl. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by xyl showed high homology with the sequence of glycoside hydrolase family 10. The gene was subcloned into an expression vector pGEX-4T-1 and the encoded protein was overexpressed as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase in Escherichia coli BL21. The expression product was purified and subjected to enzymatic characterization. The optimal temperature and pH for recombinant XYL was 25 degrees and 5.5, respectively. Recombinant XYL showed nearly 80% of its maximal activity at 4 degrees and was active in the pH range 3.0-9.5.

The synthetic exochitinase substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetylglucosamine was used to identify seven full-length exochitinase-encoding cDNAs from a Trichoderma harzianum cDNA library by expression in yeast. The cDNA clones represented transcripts of two exochitinase genes, designated as exc1 and exc2, which cross-hybridized under moderate stringency conditions in genomic Southern blots. The exc1 cDNA encodes a 578 amino acid polypeptide showing 72% similarity to the exc2-encoded 602-residue polypeptide. The deduced exochitinase amino acid sequences were found to be homologous with mammalian and fungal hexosaminidases as well as a bacterial chitobiosidase. The substrate specificity of the recombinant enzymes expressed in S. cerevisiae indicates that the enzymes are N-acetylglucosaminidases releasing single N-acetylglucosamine residues from the non-reducing end of the chitin substrate. 
8436950	19930201	J._Gen._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	An exo-beta-(1,3)-glucanase of Candida albicans: purification of the enzyme and molecular cloning of the gene.	A nucleotide sequence encoding an exo-beta-(1,3)-glucanase was cloned from a library of genomic DNA of Candida albicans ATCC 10261. The sequenced gene encodes a protein of 438 amino acid residues. The amino terminal and an internal peptide sequence of the enzyme matched with deduced sequences within the cloned gene. Analysis of the sequence indicated that the nascent protein is processed during secretion by the signal peptidase and a Kex2-like proteinase, yielding a predicted mature enzyme of 400 residues. There is 58% identity and 85% similarity between the amino acid sequences of this exoglucanase and the homologous enzyme of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An antiserum to the purified exoglucanase cross-reacted with the S. cerevisiae exoglucanase and a similar protein secreted by other C. albicans strains and Candida species. There are no sites for N-linked glycosylation in the sequence and this is consistent with the carbohydrate content of the secreted enzyme. Putative upstream promoter elements are associated with the gene. Southern analysis of the gene indicated that it was present at one copy per genome and that the diploid genome of C. albicans ATCC 10261 is heterozygous at this locus for a BglII RFLP. A 2.5 kb mRNA transcript was detected by Northern analysis and gene expression, as monitored by Northern and Western blots, reflected the growth rates of the cultures. 
15724214	20050223	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Isolation and characterization of a fruiting body-specific exo-beta-1,3-glucanase-encoding gene, exg1, from Lentinula edodes.	An exo-beta-1,3-glucanase-encoding gene was isolated from Lentinula edodes to investigate the relationship between the cell wall lytic enzyme and mushroom morphogenesis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein corresponding to the exg1 gene displayed 67% identity to AbEXG1 of Agaricus bisporus and approximately 40% identity to yeast exo-beta-1,3-glucanases. Two conserved glutamic acids within the catalytic active site in yeast exo-beta-1,3-glucanases were conserved in exg1 of L. edodes. The exg1 gene was expressed in fruiting bodies, but not in vegetative mycelia. Expression was higher in the stipe than in the pileus of young fruiting bodies. The gene was additionally expressed in the gills of mature fruiting bodies. We purified a glucanase from the stipes of young fruiting bodies that had an N-terminus identical to that of the putative exg1 product. These results collectively indicate that exg1 is involved in L. edodes fruiting body development, including stipe elongation.

Three Phanerochaete chrysosporium endo-1,4-beta-xylanase genes were cloned and expressed in Aspergillus niger. Two of these genes, xynA and xynC, encode family 10 glycoside hydrolases, while the third, xynB, codes for a family 11 glycoside hydrolase. All three xylanases possess a type I carbohydrate-binding domain connected to the catalytic domain by a linker region. The three xylanases were purified to homogeneity by weak anion or Avicell column chromatography and subsequently characterized. The XynA, XynB and XynC enzymes have molecular masses of 52, 30 and 50 kDa, respectively. Optimal activity was obtained at pH 4.5 and 70 degrees C with the family 10 xylanases and pH 4.5 and 60 degrees C with the family 11 xylanase. The measured Km when using birchwood xylan as the substrate was 3.71 +/- 0.69 mg/ml for XynA and XynC and was 9.96 +/- 1.45 mg/ml for XynB. Substrate specificity studies and the products released during the degradation of birchwood xylan suggest differences in catalytic properties between the two family 10 xylanases and the family 11 xylanase.

The egl2 gene coding a thermostable endoglucanase (EGL2) was cloned from Humicola grisea. The DNA sequence of egl2 predicted two putative introns in the coding region. The deduced amino acid sequence of EGL2 was 388 amino acids in length and showed 99.5% identity with the H. insolens CMC 3. In addition to TATA box and CAAT motifs, putative CREA binding sites were observed in the 5' upstream region of the egl2 gene. The egl2 gene was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, and EGL2 was purified. EGL2 produced by A. oryzae showed a high activity toward carboxymethyl cellulose. The optimal temperature of EGL2 was 75 degrees C, and EGL2 had more than 80% residual activity after heating up to 75 degrees C for 10 min. This is the first report of enzymatic properties of the EGL2-type thermostable cellulase homologs from Humicola.

Synthesis of invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) in Pichia anomala is controlled by the carbon source in the culture medium. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from P. anomala cells fully derepressed for invertase synthesis and shown to be a multimeric glycoprotein composed of identical subunits with an apparent molecular mass of 86.5 kDa. The carbohydrate moiety accounts for approx. 30% of the total mass of the molecule and consists of manno-oligosaccharides N-linked to the polypeptide. Most of the characteristics of the enzyme analysed in this study were similar to those previously reported for other yeast invertases, with the remarkable exception of its thermal sensitivity which appears after 15 min incubation at temperatures above 32 degrees C.

D023362 D016428 D013485 	Development of an efficient production method for beta-mannosidase by the creation of an overexpression system in Aspergillus aculeatus.	To develop an overexpression system in Aspergillus aculeatus in order to establish an efficient overproduction method of beta-mannosidase (MANB). An overexpression plasmid for the manB gene, encoding A. aculeatus MANB, was constructed and introduced into A. aculeatus cells. The gene was overexpressed under an improved promoter containing 12 copies of Region III cis-elements of Aspergillus oryzae in the transformant, and it secreted 2.56 mg MANB ml(-1) in liquid culture, which obtained a 9.4-fold higher productivity than that achieved in an overexpression system in A. oryzae. Most of the secreted protein in the cultured medium of the transformed A. aculeatus was the overproduced enzyme. Aspergillus aculeatus with the introduced overexpression plasmid produced 2.56 mg MANB ml(-1) in cultured medium. The improved promoter with A. oryzae Region III functioned in A. aculeatus; thus the strain is an expectant host for recombinant protein productions. The overexpression system with the improved promoter in A. aculeatus brought the highest productivity of MANB reported to date. The expression system would be a strong bioindustrial tool for protein production. 
23263965	20121225	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D052061 D013486 	Gene expression analysis of copper tolerance and wood decay in the brown rot fungus Fibroporia radiculosa.	High-throughput transcriptomics was used to identify Fibroporia radiculosa genes that were differentially regulated during colonization of wood treated with a copper-based preservative. The transcriptome was profiled at two time points while the fungus was growing on wood treated with micronized copper quat (MCQ). A total of 917 transcripts were differentially expressed. Fifty-eight of these genes were more highly expressed when the MCQ was protecting the wood from strength loss and had putative functions related to oxalate production/degradation, laccase activity, quinone biosynthesis, pectin degradation, ATP production, cytochrome P450 activity, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation. Sixty-one genes were more highly expressed when the MCQ lost its effectiveness (>50% strength loss) and had functions related to oxalate degradation; cytochrome P450 activity; H(2)O(2) production and degradation; degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin; hexose transport; membrane glycerophospholipid metabolism; and cell wall chemistry. Ten of these differentially regulated genes were quantified by reverse transcriptase PCR for a more in-depth study (4 time points on wood with or without MCQ treatment). Our results showed that MCQ induced higher than normal levels of expression for four genes (putative annotations for isocitrate lyase, glyoxylate dehydrogenase, laccase, and oxalate decarboxylase 1), while four other genes (putative annotations for oxalate decarboxylase 2, aryl alcohol oxidase, glycoside hydrolase 5, and glycoside hydrolase 10) were repressed. The significance of these results is that we have identified several genes that appear to be coregulated, with putative functions related to copper tolerance and/or wood decay. 
17151461	20061208	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of an alpha-amylase of Pichia burtonii isolated from the traditional starter "murcha" in Nepal.	Among more than 20 yeast strains isolated from the traditional starter "murcha" in Nepal, we characterized a yeast that might be involved in saccharification. This strain, identified as Pichia burtonii, produced an extracellular amylolytic enzyme when cultured in the presence of starch in the medium. Since no amylase secreted by P. burtonii has yet been reported, we purified the enzyme and determined its N-terminal amino acid sequence. Together with the results of a hydrolyzing activity assay toward various substrates, it was found to be an alpha-amylase. The purified enzyme, named Pichia burtonii alpha-amylase (PBA), was a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 51 kDa. Enzyme activity was optimal at pH 5.0 at 40 degrees C. The enzyme retained 80% of its original activity after incubation under the optimal pH condition at 50 degrees C for 30 min. The activity was inhibited by metal ions such as Cd(2+), Cu(2+), Hg(2+), Al(3+), and Zn(2+). 
9654123	19980708	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485 	A study on reducing substrates of manganese-oxidizing peroxidases from Pleurotus eryngii and Bjerkandera adusta.	A novel peroxidase, oxidizing Mn2+ and different aromatic compounds, was isolated. Hydroquinones, substituted phenols, dyes, other aromatic compounds and Mn2+ were compared as reducing substrates, and conclusions presented in the light of a molecular model built by homology modeling. The enzymes showed the fastest reaction rates with Mn2+, but the highest affinity corresponded to hydroquinones and dyes. Oxidation of Reactive Black 5 (an azo-dye not oxidized by Mn3+) was non-competitively inhibited by Mn2+. These findings, together with identification of putative Mn-binding site (involving Glu36, Glu40, Asp175 and inner heme propionate) and long-range electron transfer pathways, indicate that different sites are involved in substrate oxidation. 
20562284	20100622	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Novel bifunctional alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase/xylobiohydrolase (ABF3) from Penicillium purpurogenum.	The soft rot fungus Penicillium purpurogenum grows on a variety of natural substrates and secretes various isoforms of xylanolytic enzymes, including three arabinofuranosidases. This work describes the biochemical properties as well as the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of arabinofuranosidase 3 (ABF3). This enzyme has been purified to homogeneity. It is a glycosylated monomer with a molecular weight of 50,700 and can bind cellulose. The enzyme is active with p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xylopyranoside with a K(m) of 0.65 mM and 12 mM, respectively. The enzyme is active on xylooligosaccharides, yielding products of shorter length, including xylose. However, it does not hydrolyze arabinooligosaccharides. When assayed with polymeric substrates, little arabinose is liberated from arabinan and debranched arabinan; however, it hydrolyzes arabinose and releases xylooligosaccharides from arabinoxylan. Sequencing both ABF3 cDNA and genomic DNA reveals that this gene does not contain introns and that the open reading frame is 1,380 nucleotides in length. The deduced mature protein is composed of 433 amino acids residues and has a calculated molecular weight of 47,305. The deduced amino acid sequence has been validated by mass spectrometry analysis of peptides from purified ABF3. A total of 482 bp of the promoter were sequenced; putative binding sites for transcription factors such as CreA (four), XlnR (one), and AreA (three) and two CCAAT boxes were found. The enzyme has two domains, one similar to proteins of glycosyl hydrolase family 43 at the amino-terminal end and a family 6 carbohydrate binding module at the carboxyl end. ABF3 is the first described modular family 43 enzyme from a fungal source, having both alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase and xylobiohydrolase functionalities.

The treatment of effluents from textile industry with microorganisms, especially bacteria and fungi, has recently gained attention. The present study was conducted using white rot fungi Irpex lacteus, Trametes hirsuta, Trametes sp., and Lentinula edodes for the decolorization of reactive textile Levafix Blue E-RA granulate dye. I. lacteus resulted in the best decolorization and degradation of the dye within four days. Therefore, more detailed studies were carried out using I. lacteus. The decolorization was evaluated at various concentration, pH values, and temperatures. The activities of laccase, manganese peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase enzymes were estimated to reveal the roles of enzymes in decolorization. The colorless nature of the fungal cells revealed that decolorization occurred through degradation, and confirmed by analysis of the metabolites by UV-visible spectroscopy and High Performance Liquid Chromatography after decolorization. The metabolites were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, and functional group analysis was performed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The degraded dye metabolites were assessed for phytotoxicity using Vigna radiata and Brassica juncea, which demonstrated nontoxic nature of the metabolites formed after degradation of dye. 
16129506	20050901	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 	An Aspergillus oryzae acetyl xylan esterase: molecular cloning and characteristics of recombinant enzyme expressed in Pichia pastoris.	We screened 20,000 clones of an expressed sequence tag (EST) library from Aspergillus oryzae (http://www.nrib.go.jp/ken/EST/db/index.html) and obtained one cDNA clone encoding a protein with similarity to fungal acetyl xylan esterase. We also cloned the corresponding gene, designated as Aoaxe, from the genomic DNA. The deduced amino acid sequence consisted of a putative signal peptide of 31-amino acids and a mature protein of 276-amino acids. We engineered Aoaxe for heterologous expression in P. pastoris. Recombinant AoAXE (rAoAXE) was secreted by the aid of fused alpha-factor secretion signal peptide and accumulated as an active enzyme in the culture medium to a final level of 190 mg/l after 5 days. Purified rAoAXEA before and after treatment with endoglycosidase H migrated by SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 31 and 30 kDa, respectively. Purified rAoAXE displayed the greatest hydrolytic activity toward alpha-naphthylacetate (C2), lower activity toward alpha-naphthylpropionate (C3) and no detectable activity toward acyl-chain substrates containing four or more carbon atoms. The recombinant enzyme catalyzed the release of acetic acid from birchwood xylan. No activity was detectable using methyl esters of ferulic, caffeic or sinapic acids. rAoAXE was thermolabile in comparison to other AXEs from Aspergillus. 
23199738	20121204	Enzyme_Microb._Technol.	D003160 D016428 	Versatile peroxidase of Bjerkandera fumosa: substrate and inhibitor specificity.	The inhibitor and substrate specificities of versatile peroxidase from Bjerkandera fumosa (VPBF) were studied. Two different effects were found: NaN(3), Tween-80, anthracene, and fluorene decreased the activity of VPBF, but p-aminobenzoic acid increased it. A mixed mechanism of effector influence on the activity of this enzyme was shown. The catalytic properties of VPBF in the oxidation of mono- and polycyclic aromatic compounds were studied also. 2,7-Diaminofluorene, ABTS, veratryl alcohol, and syringaldazine can be oxidized by VPBF in two ways: either directly by the enzyme or by diffusible chelated Mn(3+) as an oxidizing agent. During VPBF oxidation of 2,7-diaminofluorene, both with and without Mn(2+), biphasic kinetics with apparent saturation in both micromolar and millimolar ranges were obtained. In the case of ABTS, inhibition of VPBF activity by an excess of substrate was observed. Direct oxidation of p-aminobenzoic acid by versatile peroxidase was found for the first time. The oxidation of three- and four-ring PAHs by VPBF was investigated, and the oxidation of anthracene, phenanthrene, fluorene, pyrene, chrysene, and fluoranthene was shown. The products of PAH oxidation (9,10-anthraquinone, 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, and 9-fluorenone) catalyzed by VPBF were identified. 
19049410	20081204	J._Agric._Food_Chem.	D016428 D013485 	A novel glucosylation enzyme: molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of Trichoderma viride JCM22452 alpha-amylase and enzymatic synthesis of some flavonoid monoglucosides and oligoglucosides.	It was found that commercial cellulase preparations from Trichoderma viride showed transglucosylation activity toward (+)-catechin and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) using dextrin as a glucosyl donor. To isolate the enzyme exhibiting transglucosylation activity toward (+)-catechin and EGCG, the present study isolated the cDNA encoding the T. viride JCM22452 alpha-amylase homologue (TRa2), which showed high amino acid sequence identity to functionally uncharacterized alpha-amylase homologues from other ascomycetes, which also produced some (+)-catechin and EGCG glucosides. TRa2 was able to glucosylate a wide range of natural flavonoids, particularly (+)-catechin and EGCG, and to hydrolyze maltooligosaccharides (k(cat)/K(m) for maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose were 1.98, 45.2, 58.3, 97.4, and 92.6 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively) except maltose but could not transfer the monoglucosyl residue to maltooligosaccharides. By (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR, the structures of several novel glucosides obtained by commercial cellulase preparations from T. viride and TRa2 were determined as (+)-catechin 5-O-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, (+)-catechin 5-O-alpha-D-maltoside, (+)-catechin 4'-O-alpha-D-maltoside, EGCG 5-O-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, and EGCG 7-O-alpha-D-maltoside. One of these glucosides, EGCG 5-O-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, showed higher heat stability and solubility and lower astringency and astringent stimulation than its aglycon, suggesting that EGCG glucosides are functionally superior to EGCG as food additives.

The cDNA contains 1314 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) tail and the coding region has 68% G + C content. The deduced mature MnP protein contains 357 amino acids and is preceded by a 21-amino acid leader sequence. The experimentally determined N-terminal sequence of the purified MnP-1 protein, pI = 4.9, corresponds to the deduced N-terminal sequence of the gene. The Mr of the mature MnP-1 deduced from the cDNA is 37,439, which is approximately 81.4% of the experimentally determined molecular weight. The difference is due to glycosylation and a single potential N-glycosylation site with the general sequence Asn-X-Thr/Ser is present in the deduced MnP-1 sequence. Consistent with the peroxidase mechanism of MnP, the proximal histidine, the distal histidine, and the distal arginine are all conserved and regions flanking these residues display homology with other peroxidases. Northern blot analysis indicates that MnP expression is controlled by nutrient nitrogen at the level of transcription. Southern blot hybridization analysis suggests that MnP-1 is a member of a family of MnP genes. 
19912637	20091117	Microb._Cell_Fact.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, expression in Pichia pastoris, and characterization of a thermostable GH5 mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase from Aspergillus niger BK01.	Mannans are key components of lignocellulose present in the hemicellulosic fraction of plant primary cell walls. Mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (1,4-beta-D-mannanases) catalyze the random hydrolysis of beta-1,4-mannosidic linkages in the main chain of beta-mannans. Biodegradation of beta-mannans by the action of thermostable mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase offers significant technical advantages in biotechnological industrial applications, i.e. delignification of kraft pulps or the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass rich in mannan for the production of second generation biofuels, as well as for applications in oil and gas well stimulation, extraction of vegetable oils and coffee beans, and the production of value-added products such as prebiotic manno-oligosaccharides (MOS). A gene encoding mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase or 1,4-beta-D-mannan mannanohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.78), commonly termed beta-mannanase, from Aspergillus niger BK01, which belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5), was cloned and successfully expressed heterologously (up to 243 microg of active recombinant protein per mL) in Pichia pastoris. The enzyme was secreted by P. pastoris and could be collected from the culture supernatant. The purified enzyme appeared glycosylated as a single band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of approximately 53 kDa. The recombinant beta-mannanase is highly thermostable with a half-life time of approximately 56 h at 70 degrees C and pH 4.0. The optimal temperature (10-min assay) and pH value for activity are 80 degrees C and pH 4.5, respectively. The enzyme is not only active towards structurally different mannans but also exhibits low activity towards birchwood xylan. Apparent Km values of the enzyme for konjac glucomannan (low viscosity), locust bean gum galactomannan, carob galactomannan (low viscosity), and 1,4-beta-D-mannan (from carob) are 0.6 mg mL-1, 2.0 mg mL-1, 2.2 mg mL-1 and 1.5 mg mL-1, respectively, while the kcat values for these substrates are 215 s-1, 330 s-1, 292 s-1 and 148 s-1, respectively. Judged from the specificity constants kcat/Km, glucomannan is the preferred substrate of the A. niger beta -mannanase. Analysis by thin layer chromatography showed that the main product from enzymatic hydrolysis of locust bean gum is mannobiose, with only low amounts of mannotriose and higher manno-oligosaccharides formed. This study is the first report on the cloning and expression of a thermostable mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase from A. niger in Pichia pastoris. The efficient expression and ease of purification will significantly decrease the production costs of this enzyme. Taking advantage of its acidic pH optimum and high thermostability, this recombinant beta-mannanase will be valuable in various biotechnological applications. 
15691940	20050205	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Role of the bga1-encoded extracellular {beta}-galactosidase of Hypocrea jecorina in cellulase induction by lactose.	Lactose is the only soluble and economically feasible carbon source for the production of cellulases or heterologous proteins regulated by cellulase expression signals by Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei). We investigated the role of the major beta-galactosidase of H. jecorina in lactose metabolism and cellulase induction. A genomic copy of the bga1 gene was cloned, and this copy encodes a 1,023-amino-acid protein with a 20-amino-acid signal sequence. This protein has a molecular mass of 109.3 kDa, belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 35, and is the major extracellular beta-galactosidase during growth on lactose. Its transcript was abundant during growth on l-arabinose and l-arabinitol but was much less common when the organism was grown on lactose, d-galactose, galactitol, d-xylose, and xylitol. Deltabga1 strains grow more slowly and accumulate less biomass on lactose, but the cellobiohydrolase I and II gene expression and the final cellulase yields were comparable to those of the parental strain. Overexpression of bga1 under the control of the pyruvate kinase promoter reduced the lag phase, increased growth on lactose, and limited transcription of cellobiohydrolases. We detected an additional extracellular beta-galactosidase activity that was not encoded by bga1 but no intracellular beta-galactosidase activity. In conclusion, cellulase production on lactose occurs when beta-galactosidase activity levels are low but decreases as the beta-galactosidase activities increase. The data indicate that bga1-encoded beta-galactosidase activity is a critical factor for cellulase production on lactose. 
9514754	19980606	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 	An endo-1,4-beta-xylanase-encoding gene from Agaricus bisporus is regulated by compost-specific factors.	Compost is the preferred substrate for growth of the edible fungus Agaricus bisporus. Utilization of compost requires the production of enzymes involved in degradation of lignocellulolytic components. For molecular characterization of these processes we are isolating the encoding genes. By applying heterologous screening techniques, we have cloned such a gene, which is specifically induced on compost encoding an endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (xlnA) belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 10. The gene encodes a pre-protein of 333 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 34,946 for the mature protein. The open reading frame is interrupted by ten introns of which introns 5 and 6 are separated by an exon of only two base-pairs. High expression of the xlnA gene was observed in vegetative mycelium grown on sterilized compost while xlnA messengers were not detected in fruit bodies. Addition of glucose or xylose to compost repressed xlnA expression. When glucose-grown colonies were transferred to a medium containing cellulose, xylan or xylose as sole carbon source, the organism responded by expressing xlnA at a high level for a short period. Transfer from glucose to compost yielded a much stronger and constant xlnA induction. A similar pattern of expression was found for the cel3 gene encoding a cellulase, suggesting that these genes are induced by compost-specific factors rather than by the substrates they act upon. Antiserum raised against XLNA protein, which was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, detected, when the fungus was grown on compost, an extracellular protein of 33 kDa with endo-xylanase activity. 
23306879	20130112	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Activation of Kraft Lignin by an enzymatic treatment with a versatile peroxidase from Bjerkandera sp. R1.	Enzymatic lignin activation may be an environmentally friendly alternative to the use of chemicals in the production of wood fibers composites. Most studies on enzymatic activation of lignin for improving the adhesion of lignocellulosic products have been carried out using laccases. In this work, the use of a versatile peroxidase (VP) from the white-rot fungus Bjerkandera sp. (anamorph R1) for activating Kraft lignin was studied. The effect of enzyme dosage, incubation time, and H(2)O(2) addition profile on lignin activation was evaluated by quantifying the phenoxy radicals formed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Two alternative enzymatic systems based on the use of VP (a two-stage and an enzymatic cascade system) were also assayed. At optimal conditions (dose of 15 U g(-1) and continuous addition of H(2)O(2) (5.24 μmol h(-1)) during 1 h) the content of phenoxy radicals was doubled as compared with an untreated control. Moreover, using the two-stage VP system, a lignin activation similar to that found at optimal conditions could be reached in a shorter time. 
23334282	20130122	Bioprocess_Biosyst_Eng	D016428 D013485 	Identification of naphthalene metabolism by white rot fungus Pleurotus eryngii.	The use of biomaterials or microorganisms in PAHs degradation had presented an eye-catching performance. Pleurotus eryngii is a white rot fungus, which is easily isolated from the decayed woods in the tropical rain forest, used to determine the capability to utilize naphthalene, a two-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon as source of carbon and energy. In the meantime, biotransformation of naphthalene to intermediates and other by-products during degradation was investigated in this study. Pleurotus eryngii had been incubated in liquid medium formulated with naphthalene for 14 days. The presence of metabolites of naphthalene suggests that Pleurotus eryngii begin the ring cleavage by dioxygenation on C1 and C4 position to give 1,4-naphthaquinone. 1,4-Naphthaquinone was further degraded to benzoic acid, where the proposed terepthalic acid is absent in the cultured extract. Further degradation of benzoic acid by Pleurotus eryngii shows the existence of catechol as a result of the combination of decarboxylation and hydroxylation process. Unfortunately, phthalic acid was not detected in this study. Several enzymes, including manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, laccase, 1,2-dioxygenase and 2,3-dioxygenase are enzymes responsible for naphthalene degradation. Reduction of naphthalene and the presence of metabolites in liquid medium showed the ability of Pleurotus eryngii to utilize naphthalene as carbon source instead of a limited glucose amount.  
21523473	20110428	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	An endo-β-1,6-glucanase involved in Lentinula edodes fruiting body autolysis.	A β-1,6-glucanase, LePus30A, was purified and cloned from fruiting bodies of the basidiomycete Lentinula edodes. β-1,6-glucanases degrade β-1,6-glucan polysaccharides, a unique and essential component of fungal cell walls. The complementary DNA of LePus30A includes an open reading frame of 1,575 bp encoding an 18 amino acid signal peptide and the 506 amino acid mature protein. Sequence analysis indicated that LePus30A is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 30, and highly similar genes are broadly conserved among basidiomycetes. The purified LePus30A catalyzed depolymerization of β-1,6-glucan endolytically and was highly specific toward β-1,6-glucan polysaccharide. It is known that the cell walls of fruiting bodies of basidiomycetes are autodegraded after harvesting by means of enzymatic hydrolysis. The transcript level of LePus30A gene (lepus30a) was significantly increased in fruiting bodies after harvesting. Moreover, LePus30A showed hydrolyzing activity against the cell wall components of L. edodes fruiting bodies. These results suggest that LePus30A is responsible for the degradation of the cell wall components during fruiting body autolysis after harvest. 
19734721	20090908	J._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and expression of the trichoderma harzianum C4 endo-beta-1,4-Xylanase Gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	An endo-beta-1,4-xylanase (beta-xylanase) from Trichoderma harzianum C4 was purified without cellulase activity by sequential chromatographies. The specific activity of the purified enzyme preparation was 430 units/mg on D-xylan. The complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding beta-xylanase (xynII) was amplified by PCR and isolated from cDNA PCR libraries constructed from T. harzianum C4. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment contained an open reading frame of 663 bp that encodes 221 amino acids, of which the mature protein is homologous to several beta- xylanases II. An intron of 63 bp was identified in the genomic DNA sequence of xynII. This gene was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains under the control of adh1 (alcohol dehydrogenase I) and pgk1 (phosphoglycerate kinase I) promoters in 2 mu-based plasmids, which could render recombinants able to secrete beta-xylanase into the media. 
20727822	20100824	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Contribution of ethanol-tolerant xylanase G2 from Aspergillus oryzae on Japanese sake brewing.	We purified three xylanase isozymes (XynF1, XynF3 and XynG2) from a solid-state Aspergillus oryzae RIB128 culture using chromatography. The results of our sake-brewing experiment, in which we used exogenously supplemented enzymes, revealed that only XynG2 improved the alcohol yield and the material utilization. The alcohol yield of the XynG2 batch displayed an increase of 4.4% in comparison to the control, and the amount of sake cake decreased by 4.6%. The contribution of XynG2 was further confirmed through our brewing experiment in which we used the yeast heterogeneously expressing fungal xylanase isozymes. Interestingly XynG1, an enzyme with a XynG2-like sequence that is more vulnerable to ethanol, did not improve the sake-mash fermentation. The stability of XynG2 in ethanol was prominent, and it retained most of its original activity after we exposed it to 80% ethanol for 30min, whereas the stability of the other isozymes in ethanol, including XynG1, was much lower (20-25% ethanol). We concluded, therefore, that the improvement of material utilization achieved with XynG2 is primarily attributable to its characteristically high stability in ethanol, thereby, effectively degrading rice endosperm cell walls under high-alcohol conditions such as a sake-mash environment. 
8929394	19961101	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Expression and secretion of the Candida wickerhamii extracellular beta-glucosidase gene, bglB, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	The yeast Candida wickerhamii exports a cell-associated beta-glucosidase that is active against cellobiose and all soluble cellodextrins. Because of its unique ability to tolerate end-product inhibition by glucose, the bglB gene that encodes this enzyme was previously cloned and sequenced in this laboratory. Using several different promoters and constructs, bglB was expressed in the hosts Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression was initially performed in E. coli using either the lacZ or tac promoter. This resulted in intracellular expression of the BglB protein with the protein being rapidly fragmented. Secretion and glycosylation of active beta-glucosidase was achieved with several different S. cerevisiae constructs utilizing either the adh1 or the gal1 promoter on 2-micro replicating plasmids. When either the invertase (Suc2) or the BglB secretion signal was used, BglB protein remained associated with the cell wall and appeared to be hyperglycosylated. Expression in P. pastoris was also examined to determine if higher activity and expression could be achieved in a yeast host that usually does not hyperglycosylate. Using the alcohol oxidase promoter in conjunction with either the pho1 or the alpha-factor secretion signal, the recombinant enzyme was successfully secreted and glycosylated in P. pastoris. However, levels of protein expression from the chromosomally integrated vector were insufficient to detect activity. 
12383257	20021018	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 	The beta-1,4-endogalactanase A gene from Aspergillus niger is specifically induced on arabinose and galacturonic acid and plays an important role in the degradation of pectic hairy regions.	The Aspergillus nigerbeta-1,4-endogalactanase encoding gene (galA) was cloned and characterized. The expression of galA in A. niger was only detected in the presence of sugar beet pectin, d-galacturonic acid and l-arabinose, suggesting that galA is coregulated with both the pectinolytic genes as well as the arabinanolytic genes. The corresponding enzyme, endogalactanase A (GALA), contains both active site residues identified previously for the Pseudomonas fluorescensbeta-1,4-endogalactanase. The galA gene was overexpressed to facilitate purification of GALA. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 48.5 kDa and a pH optimum between 4 and 4.5. Incubations of arabinogalactans of potato, onion and soy with GALA resulted initially in the release of d-galactotriose and d-galactotetraose, whereas prolonged incubation resulted in d-galactose and d-galactobiose, predominantly. MALDI-TOF analysis revealed the release of l-arabinose substituted d-galacto-oligosaccharides from soy arabinogalactan. This is the first report of the ability of a beta-1,4-endogalactanase to release substituted d-galacto-oligosaccharides. GALA was not active towards d-galacto-oligosaccharides that were substituted with d-glucose at the reducing end. 
10508057	19991003	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Two cellobiohydrolase-encoding genes from Aspergillus niger require D-xylose and the xylanolytic transcriptional activator XlnR for their expression.	Two cellobiohydrolase-encoding genes, cbhA and cbhB, have been isolated from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. The deduced amino acid sequence shows that CbhB has a modular structure consisting of a fungus-type cellulose-binding domain (CBD) and a catalytic domain separated by a Pro/Ser/Thr-rich linker peptide. CbhA consists only of a catalytic domain and lacks a CBD and linker peptide. Both proteins are homologous to fungal cellobiohydrolases in family 7 of the glycosyl hydrolases. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcription of the cbhA and cbhB genes is induced by D-xylose but not by sophorose and, in addition, requires the xylanolytic transcriptional activator XlnR. 
20043150	20100101	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of beta-glucosidase from a strain of Penicillium purpurogenum KJS506.	A novel beta-glucosidase (BGL)-producing strain was isolated and identified as Penicillium purpurogenum KJS506 based on its morphology and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA gene sequence. When rice straw and corn steep powder were used as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, the maximal BGL activity of 12.3 U ml(-1), one of the highest levels among BGL-producing microorganisms was observed. The optimum temperature and pH for BGL production were 32 degrees C and 4, respectively. An extracellular BGL was purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography of P. purpurogenum culture supernatants, and the purified BGL showed higher activity (V (max) = 934 U mg protein(-1)) than most BGLs from other sources. The complete ORF of bgl3 was cloned from P. purpurogenum by a modified thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction. The bgl3 gene consists of a 2,571-bp ORF and encodes a putative protein containing 856 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 89,624 Da. The putative gene product was identified as a member of glycoside hydrolase family 3. The present results should contribute to improved industrial production of BGL by P. purpurogenum KJS506. 
12137954	20020726	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Differences in expression of two endoxylanase genes (xynA and xynB) from Penicillium purpurogenum.	A number of xylanolytic microorganisms secrete to the medium several molecular forms of endoxylanases. The physiological function of these isoforms is not clear; one possibility is that they are produced under different growth conditions. To study this problem, we have used two endoxylanases (XynA and XynB) produced by the fungus Penicillium purpurogenum. These enzymes have been previously purified and characterized; they belong to family 10 and 11 of the glycosyl hydrolases, respectively. The promoters of the xynA and xynB genes have been sequenced; both present consensus sequences for the binding of the carbon catabolite repressor CreA, but otherwise show substantial differences. The xynB promoter has eight boxes in tandem for the binding of the XlnR activator and lacks the consensus sequence for the PacC pH regulator. On the other hand, the xynA promoter contains one XlnR box and three PacC consensus sequences. To investigate if these differences are reflected in gene expression, Northern blot assays were carried out. The xynA gene is transiently expressed when oat spelt xylan is used as carbon source, but negligible expression was observed with birchwood xylan, xylose or xylitol. In contrast, xynB is broadly induced by all these carbon sources; this may be related to the presence of several XlnR boxes. Similar results were obtained by zymogram analysis of the expressed proteins. The different induction capabilities of birchwood and oat spelt xylan may be due to differences in their composition and structure. Expression assays carried out at different pH reflects that, despite the lack of PacC binding sites in the xynB promoter, this gene is tightly regulated by pH. The findings described here illustrate new and important differences between endoxylanases from families 10 and 11 in P. purpurogenum. They may help explain the production of multiple endoxylanase forms by this organism. 
18060506	20071207	J._Comput._Aided_Mol._Des.	D016428 D013485 	An eleven amino acid residue deletion expands the substrate specificity of acetyl xylan esterase II (AXE II) from Penicillium purpurogenum.	The soft-rot fungus Penicillium purpurogenum secretes to the culture medium a variety of enzymes related to xylan biodegradation, among them three acetyl xylan esterases (AXE I, II and III). AXE II has 207 amino acids; it belongs to family 5 of the carbohydrate esterases and its structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 0.9 A resolution (PDB 1G66). The enzyme possesses the alpha/beta hydrolase fold and the catalytic triad typical of serine esterases (Ser90, His187 and Asp175). AXE II can hydrolyze esters of a large variety of alcohols, but it is restricted to short chain fatty acids. An analysis of its three-dimensional structure shows that a loop that covers the active site may be responsible for this strict specificity. Cutinase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes esters of long chain fatty acids and shows a structure similar to AXE II, lacks this loop. In order to generate an AXE II with this broader specificity, the preparation of a mutant lacking residues involving this loop (Gly104 to Ala114) was proposed. A set of molecular simulation experiments based on a comparative model of the mutant enzyme predicted a stable structure. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the loop's residues have been eliminated from the AXE II cDNA. The mutant protein has been expressed in Aspergillus nidulans A722 and Pichia pastoris, and it is active towards a range of fatty acid esters of up to at least 14 carbons. The availability of an esterase with broader specificity may have biotechnological applications for the synthesis of sugar esters. 
7926830	19941011	Gene	D016428 D013486 D013487 	Characterization of a cDNA encoding a manganese peroxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium: genomic organization of lignin and manganese peroxidase-encoding genes.	Two heme proteins, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP), play key roles in the fungal depolymerization of lignin. Many cDNA and genomic clones encoding these peroxidases have been published. We report here on the cDNA lambda MP-2 encoding the MnP isozyme H3 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium strain BKM-F-1767. We also demonstrate that the MnP-encoding gene, lambda MP-1, encoding isozyme H4, and lambda MP-2 reside on separate chromosomes from each other and from the LiP-encoding genes. From these results, it is apparent that lambda MP-2 is not linked to lambda MP-1 or other genes believed to be involved in lignin depolymerization, such as the LiP and glyoxal oxidase.

An extracellular endo-1,4-beta-xylanase with specific activity of 566 U/mg was purified from the culture filtrate of a filamentous fungus, Aspergillus japonicus strain MU-2, grown on oat spelt xylan. The purified enzyme showed a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent M(r) of 25.1 kDa. Xylanase activity was optimal at pH 5.0 and 60 degrees C. The xylanase gene (xynA) encoded a 42 residue prepropeptide and a 191 residue mature protein. The XynA protein showed the highest sequence identity of 69% to Aspergillus niger XynB (DQ174549), which belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 11.

Magnaporthe grisea, the fungal pathogen that causes rice blast disease, secretes two endo-beta-1,4-D-xylanases (E. C. 3.2.1.8) when grown on rice cell walls as the only carbon source. One of the xylanases, XYN33, is a 33-kD protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and accounts for approximately 70% of the endoxylanase activity in the culture filtrate. The second xylanase, XYN22, is a 22-kD protein and accounts for approximately 30% of the xylanase activity. The two proteins were purified, cloned, and sequenced. XYN33 and XYN22 are both basic proteins with calculated isoelectric points of 9.95 and 9.71, respectively. The amino acid sequences of XYN33 and XYN22 are not homologous, but they are similar, respectively, to family F and family G xylanases from other microorganisms. The genes encoding XYN33 and XYN22, designated XYN33 and XYN22, are single-copy in the haploid genome of M. grisea and are expressed when M. grisea is grown on rice cell walls or on oatspelt xylan, but not when grown on sucrose.

This is the first report of glycoside hydrolase family 43 beta-xylosidase from Aspergillus oryzae. To characterize this enzyme, the recombinant enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli. Unlike known beta-xylosidases from fungal origins, the enzyme did not show substrate ambiguity and was stable at alkaline pH. 
7788717	19950101	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013486 	Sequence analysis of the Aspergillus nidulans pectate lyase pelA gene and evidence for binding of promoter regions to CREA, a regulator of carbon catabolite repression.	The nucleic acid and deduced amino-acid sequences of the pectate lyase gene (pelA) from Aspergillus nidulans are presented. The pelA gene contains two short introns, 68 and 49 bp in length, and encodes a peptide of 326 amino acids. Five transcriptional start sites are clustered between 65 and 79 bp upstream of the start codon as determined by primer extension. Comparison of the amino-acid sequences of pectate or pectin lyases from bacteria, fungi and plants revealed less than 30% overall identity. However, five regions within these enzymes, in particular domains associated with the active site, are highly conserved with amino-acid similarities greater than 50%. Phylogenetic analysis using the principle of parsimony (PAUP 3.1.1) showed that pelA is most closely related to pectate lyases from plants rather than pectin lyases from other fungi. Previously, pelA was shown to be induced by polygalacturonic acid and repressed in the presence of preferred carbon sources, such as glucose. Gel mobility shift analysis indicates that a PstI-SphI fragment from the pelA promoter binds to a fusion protein composed of the N-terminal part of CREA, a protein involved in carbon catabolite repression, and glutathione-S-transferase. This result suggests CREA may contribute to the regulation of pelA expression. 
15869957	20050505	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 	Characteristics of novel lignin peroxidases produced by white-rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624.	We characterized a lignin peroxidase (YK-LiP2) isolated from shaking culture inoculated with the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624. The YK-LiP2 enzyme was identified and purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and gel permeation chromatography. The molecular weight of YK-LiP2 was approximately 45 kDa, and its absorption spectrum was almost the same as that of the LiP (Pc-LiP) from P. chrysosporium. Steady-state kinetics of veratryl alcohol (VA) oxidation by YK-LiP2 revealed an ordered bi-bi ping-pong mechanism, although the Pc-LiP oxidation of ferrocytochrome c obeys peroxidase ping-pong kinetics rather than ordered bi-bi ping-pong kinetics. Degradation of dimeric lignin model compounds by YK-LiP2 was more effective than that by Pc-LiP. Moreover, YK-LiP2 and YK-LiP1, which was previously isolated from static culture inoculated with P. sordida YK-624, oxidized VA under a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide (>2.5 mM) although Pc-LiP could not oxidize VA in the presence of 2.5 mM hydrogen peroxide.

GOX is the most widely used enzyme for the development of electrochemical glucose biosensors and biofuel cell in physiological conditions. The present work describes the production of a recombinant glucose oxidase from Penicillium amagasakiense (yGOXpenag) displaying a more efficient glucose catalysis (k(cat)/K(M)(glucose)=93 μM⁻¹ s⁻¹) than the native GOX from Aspergillus niger (nGOXaspng), which is the most industrially used (k(cat)/K(M)(glucose)=27 μM⁻¹ s⁻¹). Expression in Pichia pastoris allowed easy production and purification of the recombinant active enzyme, without overglycosylation. Its biotechnological interest was further evaluated by measuring kinetics of ferrocinium-methanol (FM(ox)) reduction, which is commonly used for electron transfer to the electrode surface. Despite their homologies in sequence and structure, pH-dependent FM(ox) reduction was different between the two enzymes. At physiological pH and temperature, we observed that electron transfer to the redox mediator is also more efficient for yGOXpenag than for nGOXaspng(k(cat)/K(M)(FM(ox))=27 μM⁻¹ s⁻¹ and 17 μM⁻¹ s⁻¹ respectively). In our model system, the catalytic current observed in the presence of blood glucose concentration (5 mM) was two times higher with yGOXpenag than with nGOXaspng. All our results indicated that yGOXpenag is a better candidate for industrial development of efficient bioelectrochemical devices used in physiological conditions. 
10493932	19990924	Biochem._J.	D016428 	A modular cinnamoyl ester hydrolase from the anaerobic fungus Piromyces equi acts synergistically with xylanase and is part of a multiprotein cellulose-binding cellulase-hemicellulase complex.	A collection of clones, isolated from a Piromyces equi cDNA expression library by immunoscreening with antibodies raised against affinity purified multienzyme fungal cellulase-hemicellulase complex, included one which expressed cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activity. The P. equi cinnamoyl ester hydrolase gene (estA) comprised an open reading frame of 1608 nt encoding a protein (EstA) of 536 amino acids and 55540 Da. EstA was modular in structure and comprised three distinct domains. The N-terminal domain was closely similar to a highly conserved non-catalytic 40-residue docking domain which is prevalent in cellulases and hemicellulases from three species of anaerobic fungi and binds to a putative scaffolding protein during assembly of the fungal cellulase complex. The second domain was also not required for esterase activity and appeared to be an atypically large linker comprising multiple tandem repeats of a 13-residue motif. The C-terminal 270 residues of EstA contained an esterase catalytic domain that exhibited overall homology with a small family of esterases, including acetylxylan esterase D (XYLD) from Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa and acetylxylan esterase from Aspergillus niger. This region also contained several smaller blocks of residues that displayed homology with domains tentatively identified as containing the essential catalytic residues of a larger group of serine hydrolases. A truncated variant of EstA, comprising the catalytic domain alone (EstA'), was expressed in Escherichia coli as a thioredoxin fusion protein and was purified to homogeneity. EstA' was active against synthetic and plant cell-wall-derived substrates, showed a marked preference for cleaving 1-->5 ester linkages between ferulic acid and arabinose in feruloylated arabino-xylo-oligosaccharides and was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor aminoethylbenzene-sulphonylfluoride. EstA' acted synergistically with xylanase to release more than 60% of the esterified ferulic acid from the arabinoxylan component of plant cell walls. Western analysis confirmed that EstA is produced by P. equi and is a component of the aggregated multienzyme cellulase-hemicellulase complex. Hybrid proteins, harbouring one, two or three iterations of the conserved 40-residue fungal docking domain fused to the reporter protein glutathione S-transferase, were produced. Western blot analysis of immobilized P. equi cellulase-hemicellulase complex demonstrated that each of the hybrid proteins bound to a 97 kDa polypeptide in the extracellular complex.

D016428 D013485 	An endo-polygalacturonase (PG) of Fusarium moniliforme escaping inhibition by plant polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) provides new insights into the PG-PGIP interaction.	Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are plant defence molecules inhibiting the activity of fungal endo-polygalacturonases (endo-PGs). We found that soybean and bean PGIPs inhibited the endo-PG activity produced by the isolate FC-10 of Fusarium moniliforme but not the enzyme activity produced by the isolate PD of F. moniliforme. The bean PGIP proved to be ineffective against all the PG isoforms produced by the PD isolate. Deduced amino acid sequence comparison between PGs from PD, FC-10 and 62264 isolates identified the structural regions of the enzyme possibly related to its resistance to PGIP inhibition. These include one region at the N-terminal portion of the enzyme and a few single amino acid substitutions along the entire sequence, two of which surrounding the active site.

D016428 D013485 	Mutations in the substrate entrance region of β-glucosidase from Trichoderma reesei improve enzyme activity and thermostability.	β-Glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) plays an essential role in biofuel production since it can cleave β-1,4-glycosidic bond to convert cellobiose into fermentable glucose. Based on the structure of Trichoderma reesei β-glucosidase 2 (TrBgl2) we solved, the amino acids in the outer channel of active site were mutated in this study. Mutants P172L and P172L/F250A showed the most enhanced k(cat)/K(m) and k(cat) values by 5.3- and 6.9-fold, respectively, compared to the wild type (WT) toward 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG) substrate at 40°C. L167W and P172L/F250A mutations resulted in shift of optimal temperature to 50°C, at which WT was almost inactive. However, thin-layer chromatography analysis revealed that mutant L167W had the best synergism with T. reesei cellulases on degrading cellulosic substrates into glucose. This study enhances our understanding on the roles of amino acids in the substrate entrance region away from the active site and provides engineered T. reesei β-glucosidases with better activity and/or thermostability to hydrolyze cellobiose.

D016428 	Isolation and characterization of glucoamylase from a wastewater treatment yeast Hansenula fabianii J640, and construction of expression vector.	Hansenula fabianii J640 highly expresses an extracellular glucoamylase (GA). Here, we purified the GA and showed that it has pH and temperature optima of 5.0 and 50 °C, respectively, stable at temperatures up to 50 °C, and is inhibited by Ag(2+), Hg(2+), and Cu(2+). The gene was found in an expression library with anti-GA antibodies. A cDNA was found to encode 491 amino acids, including a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids. Because of the gene's high expression, we used its promoter and terminator regions to improve a previously developed H. fabianii J640 expression system.

We have cloned a gene encoding a polygalacturonase (PG) in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger RH5344. The structural gene comprises 1141 bp coding for 362 amino acids and the open reading frame is disrupted by one intron of 52 bp. Eukaryotic consensus sequences for transcription regulation are found only in deviated forms. The biological functionality of the isolated PG gene was established by retransformation in A. niger and Aspergillus awamori. In addition, we have found that the PG protein of A. niger shares significant similarities with PG proteins from tomato and Erwinia carotovora. Comparison of the three enzymes revealed a highly conserved region in their C-terminal region probably comprising the elements of substrate binding and the catalytic centre.

An extracellular endo-1,4-beta-xylanase was purified from the culture filtrate of a filamentous fungus Penicillium citrinum FERM P-15944 grown on birch-wood xylan. The purified enzyme showed a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent M(r) of 20,000 and had an isoelectric point below 3.5. Xylanase activity was optimal at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C. The genomic DNA and cDNAs encoding this protein were cloned and sequenced. Southern blot analysis indicated that the xylanase gene (xynA) was present as a single copy in the genome. An open reading frame of 657 bp was interrupted by two introns of 65 and 55 bp, and encoded a presumed prepropeptide of 27 amino acids and a mature protein of 190 amino acids. Three distinct transcription start points were observed at positions -20 (A), -31 (A), and -36 (A) from the start codon. The 5'-noncoding region had a putative TATA box at nt -66 (TATAAA). The xynA cDNA was functionally expressed under the control of the alcohol oxidase I gene promoter in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. A neighbor-joining tree showed that the P. citrinum enzyme is closely related to several other fungal xylanases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 11: Trichoderma reesei XYN2, Aspergillus niger xynNB, Penicillium funiculosum xynC, Penicillium sp. strain 40 xynA, Chaetomium gracile cgxB, and Aspergillus nidulans xlnA and xlnB. 
16244441	20051026	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Glucoamylase originating from Schwanniomyces occidentalis is a typical alpha-glucosidase.	A starch-hydrolyzing enzyme from Schwanniomyces occidentalis has been reported to be a novel glucoamylase, but there is no conclusive proof that it is glucoamylase. An enzyme having the hydrolytic activity toward soluble starch was purified from a strain of S. occidentalis. The enzyme showed high catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) for maltooligosaccharides, compared with that for soluble starch. The product anomer was alpha-glucose, differing from glucoamylase as a beta-glucose producing enzyme. These findings are striking characteristics of alpha-glucosidase. The DNA encoding the enzyme was cloned and sequenced. The primary structure deduced from the nucleotide sequence was highly similar to mold, plant, and mammalian alpha-glucosidases of alpha-glucosidase family II and other glucoside hydrolase family 31 enzymes, and the two regions involved in the catalytic reaction of alpha-glucosidases were conserved. These were no similarities to the so-called glucoamylases. It was concluded that the enzyme and also S. occidentalis glucoamylase, had been already reported, were typical alpha-glucosidases, and not glucoamylase.

D016428 D013485 	Role of subsite +1 residues in pH dependence and catalytic activity of the glycoside hydrolase family 1 beta-glucosidase BGL1A from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	The basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium produces two glycoside hydrolase family 1 intracellular beta-glucosidases, BGL1A and BGL1B, during the course of cellulose degradation. In order to clarify the catalytic difference between two enzymes, in spite of their high similarity in amino acid sequences (65%), five amino acids around the catalytic site of BGL1A were individually mutated to those of BGL1B (V173C, M177L, D229N, H231D, and K253A), and the effects of the mutations on cellobiose hydrolysis were evaluated. When the kinetic parameters (K(m) and k(cat)) were compared at the optimum pH for the wild-type enzyme, the kinetic efficiency was decreased in the cases of D229N, H231D, and K253A, but not V173C or M177L. The pH dependence of cellobiose hydrolysis showed a significantly more acidic pH profile for the D229N mutant, compared with the wild-type enzyme. Since D229 is located between K253 and the putative acid/base catalyst E170, we prepared the double mutant D229N/K253A, and found that its hydrolytic activity at neutral pH was restored to that of the wild-type enzyme. Our results indicate that the interaction between D229 and K253 is critical for the pH dependence and catalytic activity of BGL1A. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

D016428 D013485 	Enhanced inulinase production in solid state fermentation by a mutant of the marine yeast Pichia guilliermondii using surface response methodology and inulin hydrolysis.	In order to isolate inulinase overproducers of the marine yeast Pichia guilliermondii, strain 1, cells were mutated by using UV light and LiCl(2). One mutant (M-30) with enhanced inulinase production was obtained. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the medium compositions and cultivation conditions for inulinase production by the mutant in solid-state fermentation. The initial moisture, inoculum, the amount ratio of wheat bran to rice bran, temperature, pH for the maximum inulinase production by the mutant M-30 were found to be 60.5%, 2.5%, 0.42, 30 degrees C and 6.50, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, 455.9 U/grams of dry substrate (gds) of inulinase activity was reached in the solid state fermentation culture of the mutant M-30 whereas the predicted maximum inulinase activity of 459.2 U/gds was derived from RSM regression. Under the same conditions, its parent strain only produced 291.0 U/gds of inulinase activity. This is the highest inulinase activity produced by the yeast strains reported so far.

Penicillium purpurogenum secretes arabinofuranosidase to the growth medium. Highest levels of enzyme (1.0 U ml(-1)) are obtained when L-arabitol is used as carbon source, while 0.85 and 0.7 U ml(-1) are produced with sugar beet pulp and oat spelts xylan, respectively. By means of a zymogram, three bands with arabinofuranosidase activity have been detected in the supernatant of a culture grown in oat spelts xylan. One of the enzymes was purified to homogeneity from this supernatant using gel filtration (BioGel P-100), cation exchange chromatography (CM-Sephadex C-50), hydrophobic interaction chromatography (phenyl agarose) and a second BioGel P-100 column. The enzyme is a monomer of 58 kDa with a pI of 6.5. Optimum pH is 4.0 and optimal temperature 50 degrees C. The arabinofuranosidase is highly specific for alpha-L-arabinofuranosides and liberates arabinose from arabinoxylan. The enzyme shows hyperbolic kinetics towards p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside with a K(M) of 1.23 mM. A 36-residue N-terminal sequence is over 70% identical to that of fungal arabinofuranosidases belonging to family 54 of the glycosyl hydrolases. Based on the sequence similarity and other biochemical properties it is proposed that the purified enzyme from P. purpurogenum belongs to family 54. 
21237221	20110118	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Homologous overexpression of xylanase in Fusarium oxysporum increases ethanol productivity during consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of lignocellulosics.	In an effort to increase ethanol productivity during the consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of lignocellulosics by Fusarium oxysporum, we attempted the constitutive homologous overexpression of one of the key process enzymes, namely an endo-xylanase. The endo-β-1,4-xylanase 2 gene was incorporated into the F. oxysporum genome under the regulation of the gpdA promoter of Aspergillus nidulans. The transformation was effected through Agrobacterium tumefaciens and resulted in 12 transformants, two of which were selected for further study due to their high extracellular xylanase activities under normally repressing conditions (glucose as sole carbon source). During natural induction conditions (growth on xylan) though, the extracellular enzyme levels of the transformants were only marginally higher (5-10%) compared to the wild type despite the significantly stronger xylanase 2 mRNA signals. SDS-PAGE verified enzyme assay results that there was no intracellular xylanase 2 accumulation in the transformants, suggesting the potential regulation in a post transcriptional or translational level. The fermentative performance of the transformants was evaluated and compared to that of the wild type in simple CBP systems using either corn cob or wheat bran as sole carbon sources. Both transformants produced approximately 60% more ethanol compared to the wild type on corn cob, while for wheat bran this picture was repeated for only one of them. This result is attributed to the high extracellular xylanase activities in the transformants' fermentation broths that were maintained 2-2.5-fold higher compared to the wild type. 
2076554	19901201	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Regulation of the glaA gene of Aspergillus niger.	The glucoamylase gene of Aspergillus niger, glaA, is expressed at high levels in the presence of starch. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of 1966 bp of the 5' flanking region of the glaA gene and have begun to identify sequences important for the control of glaA expression by deletion analysis. Constructs containing deletions extending into the glaA gene promoter were introduced into an A. niger host whose own glaA gene had been disrupted by a gene replacement event. Secreted levels of glucoamylase, expressed from each of the recombinant glaA genes, were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The effect of each deletion on the expression of glaA, when grown on differing carbon sources, was used to determine the limits of sequences upstream of glaA responsible for gene regulation. A region between -562 and -318 appears to direct high-level expression, whereas only 214 bp of 5' flanking sequence is required to initiate the start to transcription. 
17345128	20070309	Microb._Ecol.	D016428 D013485 	Inulinase-producing marine yeasts: evaluation of their diversity and inulin hydrolysis by their crude enzymes.	Total 427 yeast strains from seawater, sediments, mud of salterns, guts of the marine fish, and marine algae were obtained. After inulinase activity of the yeast cultures was estimated, we found that four strains (OUC1, G7a, OUC2, and G7a1) of the marine yeasts grown in the medium with inulin could secrete a large amount of inulinase into the medium. The results of routine identification and molecular methods show that they belong to Pichia guilliermondii OUC1, Cryptococcus aureus G7a, Yarrowia lipolytica OUC2, and Debaryomyces hansenii G7a1, respectively. The optimal pHs of inulinase activity produced by them were 6.0, 5.0, 5.0, and 5.0, respectively, while the optimal temperatures of inulinase activity produced by them were 60 degrees , 50 degrees , 60 degrees , and 50 degrees C, respectively. A large amount of monosaccharides and a trace amount of oligosaccharides were detected after the hydrolysis by the crude inulinase produced by P. guilliermondii OUC1, indicating that the crude inulinase had a high exoinulinase activity while a large amount of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides were detected after inulin hydrolysis by the crude inulinase produced both by C. aureus G7a and D. hansenii G7a1. However, no monosaccharides and disaccharides were detected after inulin hydrolysis by the crude inulinase produced by Y. lipolytica OUC2, suggesting that the crude inulinase had no exoinulinase activity.

A fungal strain, BCC2871 (Periconia sp.), was found to produce a thermotolerant beta-glucosidase, BGL I, with high potential for application in biomass conversion. The full-length gene encoding the target enzyme was identified and cloned into Pichia pastoris KM71. Similar to the native enzyme produced by BCC2871, the recombinant beta-glucosidase showed optimal temperature at 70 degrees C and optimal pH of 5 and 6. The enzyme continued to exhibit high activity even after long incubation at high temperature, retaining almost 60% of maximal activity after 1.5h at 70 degrees C. It was also stable under basic conditions, retaining almost 100% of maximal activity after incubation for 2h at pH8. The enzyme has high activity towards cellobiose and other synthetic substrates containing glycosyl groups as well as cellulosic activity toward carboxymethylcellulose. Thermostability of the enzyme was improved remarkably in the presence of cellobiose, glucose, or sucrose. This beta-glucosidase was able to hydrolyze rice straw into simple sugars. The addition of this beta-glucosidase to the rice straw hydrolysis reaction containing a commercial cellulase, Celluclast 1.5L (Novozyme, Denmark) resulted in increase of reducing sugars being released compared to the hydrolysis without the beta-glucosidase. This enzyme is a candidate for applications that convert lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels and chemicals.

We characterized kinetics and substrate oxidation of a novel lignin peroxidase (YK-LiP) isolated from white-rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624. YK-LiP enzyme was identified and purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and gel permeation chromatography. The molecular mass of YK-LiP was approximately 50 kDa, and the absorption spectrum of YK-LiP was almost the same as that of the LiP (Pc-LiP) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Steady-state kinetics of veratryl alcohol oxidation by YK-LiP (unlike that by Pc-LiP) revealed a bi-reactant sequential mechanism, although reactivity of YK-LiP to various monomeric substituted aromatic compounds was similar to that of Pc-LiP. Degradation of dimeric lignin model compounds was more effective by YK-LiP than by Pc-LiP, and the oxidation rate of sinapyl alcohol oligomer by YK-LiP was much faster than that by Pc-LiP. 
2331322	19900401	Biotechnol._Appl._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of polygalacturonases produced by the hyphal fungus Aspergillus niger.	Five endo-polygalacturonases (poly(1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide) glycanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.15) and one exo-polygalacturonase (poly(1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide) galacturonohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.67) were isolated from a commercial pectinase preparation derived from Aspergillus niger. All five endo-enzymes could be purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on cross-linked alginate, ion-exchange chromatography, chromatofocusing, and gel permeation chromatography. The exo-polygalacturonase was only partially purified but free from endo-polygalacturonase activity. The two most abundant endo-polygalacturonases (endo-I and endo-II), with molecular masses of 55 and 38 kDa, respectively, are quite different with respect to their isoelectric point, specific activity, mode of action on oligomeric substrates, and amino acid composition. The physicochemical properties of the other three endo-polygalacturonases (endo-IIIA, endo-IIIB, and endo-IV), present in low amounts, are quite similar to those of the endo-I type. The pH optima of all these endo-polygalacturonases are in the range of 4.3-4.9. 
17503147	20070516	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 	Isolation and characterization of two genes that encode active glucoamylase without a starch binding domain from Rhizopus oryzae.	Glucoamylase obtained from Rhizopus sp. is frequently preferred for certain applications of starch modification or saccharification. The predominant enzyme, which contains a starch-binding domain on the amino terminus, has been previously characterized from several species. Additionally, the cDNA encoding this protein was cloned and found to show 100% identity to a R. oryzae strain 99-880 that has recently been sequenced by the Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Analysis of this genome indicates coding regions for two additional glucoamylase genes, amyC and amyD, lacking a starch-binding domain. The two genes encode proteins that are approximately 50% identical to the catalytic region of the AmyA protein and 67% identical to each other. The predicted AmyC and AmyD proteins contain the highly conserved signature sequences of Family 15 glycoside hydrolases. The two genes appear to be transcriptionally expressed in cultures grown in fermentable and gluconeogenic carbon sources. The predicted 49.7-kD AmyC and 48.8-kD AmyD proteins were expressed in several different ways using Pichia pastoris. When the sequence for putative secretion signal was left intact, glucoamylase activity was detected in the crude cell extracts, but no activity was present in the growth medium. However, replacement of this region with the yeast alpha-secretion signal resulted in secretion of active glucoamylase that was able to degrade soluble starch.

A 2172-bp full-length gene (aga-F78), encoding a protease-resistant alpha-galactosidase, was cloned from Rhizopus sp. F78 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence shared highest identity (45.0%) with an alpha-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 from Absidia corymbifera. After one step purification with Ni-NTA chelating column, the recombinant Aga-F78 migrated as a single band of ~82 and ~210 kDa on SDS-PAGE and non-denaturing gradient PAGE, respectively, indicating that the native structure of the recombinant Aga-F78 was trimer. Exhibiting the similar properties as the authentic protein, purified recombinant Aga-F78 was optimally active at 50 degrees and pH 4.8, highly pH stable over the pH range 5.0-10.0, more resistant to some cations and proteases, and had wide substrate specificity (pNPG, melidiose, raffinose and stachyose). The recombinant enzyme also showed good hydrolytic ability to soybean meal, releasing galactose of 415.58 microng/g soybean meal. When combined with trypsin, the enzyme remained over 90% degradability to soybean meal. These favorable properties make Aga-F78 a potential candidate for applications in the food and feed industries.

10347026	19990529	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Differential expression of three alpha-galactosidase genes and a single beta-galactosidase gene from Aspergillus niger.	A gene encoding a third alpha-galactosidase (AglB) from Aspergillus niger has been cloned and sequenced. The gene consists of an open reading frame of 1,750 bp containing six introns. The gene encodes a protein of 443 amino acids which contains a eukaryotic signal sequence of 16 amino acids and seven putative N-glycosylation sites. The mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48,835 Da and a predicted pI of 4.6. An alignment of the AglB amino acid sequence with those of other alpha-galactosidases revealed that it belongs to a subfamily of alpha-galactosidases that also includes A. niger AglA. A. niger AglC belongs to a different subfamily that consists mainly of prokaryotic alpha-galactosidases. The expression of aglA, aglB, aglC, and lacA, the latter of which encodes an A. niger beta-galactosidase, has been studied by using a number of monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric compounds as growth substrates. Expression of aglA is only detected on galactose and galactose-containing oligomers and polymers. The aglB gene is expressed on all of the carbon sources tested, including glucose. Elevated expression was observed on xylan, which could be assigned to regulation via XlnR, the xylanolytic transcriptional activator. Expression of aglC was only observed on glucose, fructose, and combinations of glucose with xylose and galactose. High expression of lacA was detected on arabinose, xylose, xylan, and pectin. Similar to aglB, the expression on xylose and xylan can be assigned to regulation via XlnR. All four genes have distinct expression patterns which seem to mirror the natural substrates of the encoded proteins.

The fungal strain Mortierella alliacea YN-15 is an arachidonic acid producer that assimilates soluble starch despite having undetectable alpha-amylase activity. Here, a alpha-glucosidase responsible for the starch hydrolysis was purified from the culture broth through four-step column chromatography. Maltose and other oligosaccharides were less preferentially hydrolyzed and were used as a glucosyl donor for transglucosylation by the enzyme, demonstrating distinct substrate specificity as a fungal alpha-glucosidase. The purified enzyme consisted of two heterosubunits of 61 and 31 kDa that were not linked by a covalent bond but stably aggregated to each other even at a high salt concentration (0.5 M), and behaved like a single 92-kDa component in gel-filtration chromatography. The hydrolytic activity on maltose reached a maximum at 55 degrees C and in a pH range of 5.0-6.0, and in the presence of ethanol, the transglucosylation reaction to form ethyl-alpha-D-glucoside was optimal at pH 5.0 and a temperature range of 45-50 degrees C.

Two rhamnogalacturonases from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus have been cloned and characterized. A cDNA library from A. aculeatus was constructed, and a novel rhamnogalacturonase B was isolated by expression cloning in yeast. For this purpose a new plate screening assay was developed, specific for the detection of rhamnogalacturonase activity. The rhamnogalacturonase A, known from previous reports, was shown not to be expressed in yeast in an active form. Therefore, rhamnogalacturonase A was purified, peptide sequences were obtained, and full-length cDNAs encoding the enzyme were isolated using a polymerase chain reaction-generated product as a probe. Comparison of the deduced primary structures indicates that the two rhamnogalacturonases are structurally different. This is further supported by the finding that polyclonal antibodies raised against native rhamnogalacturonase A do not cross-react with rhamnogalacturonase B. The cloned genes were transformed into Aspergillus oryzae for high level expression. The recombinant enzymes were purified and characterized, revealing significant differences in glycosylation pattern and substrate specificity as well as in pH and temperature optima and stability. Data from the hydrolysis of apple rhamnogalacturonan with the recombinant rhamnogalacturonases suggest that the two enzymes exert their action at different sites in the backbone. 
15756814	20050311	Protein_J.	D016428 	Cloning and characterization of the xyn11A gene from Lentinula edodes.	Hemicellulose represents a rich source of biomass that can be converted into useful chemical feedstocks. One of the main components of hemicellulose is xylan, a polymer of xylose residues. Xylanase enzymes that hydrolyze xylan are therefore of great commercial interest. We have cloned a gene (xyn11A) that encodes a 283-amino acid xylanase enzyme from the fungus Lentinula edodes. The enzyme has a pI of 4.6 and belongs to the highly conserved glycosyl hydrolase family 11. The xylanase gene was cloned into a Pichia pastoris expression vector that secretes active enzyme into both solid and liquid media. The optimal reaction conditions were at pH 4.5 and 50 degrees C. The enzyme had a Km of 1.5 mg/ml and a Vmax of 2.1 mmol/min/mg. Xyn11A produced primarily xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylotetraose from a birchwood xylan substrate. This is the first report on the cloning of a hemicellulase gene from L. edodes. 
16275128	20051109	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, expression, and characterization of a xylanase 10 from Aspergillus terreus (BCC129) in Pichia pastoris.	A full-length xylanase gene, encoding 326 amino acids belonging to the fungal glycosyl hydrolase family 10, from Aspergillus terreus BCC129 was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis suggested that the first 25 amino acids of this enzyme is the signal peptide. Therefore, only the mature xylanase gene of 906 bp was cloned into a yeast expression vector, pPICZalphaA, for heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. A band of approximately, 33 kDa was observed on the SDS-PAGE gel after one day of methanol induction. The expressed enzyme was purified by gel filtration chromatography. The purified recombinant xylanase demonstrated optimal activity at 60 degrees C, pH 5.0 and a Km of 4.8 +/- 0.07 mg/ml and a Vmax of 757 +/- 14.54 micromol/min mg, using birchwood xylan as a substrate. Additionally, the purified enzyme demonstrated broad pH stability from 4 to 10 when incubated at 40 degrees C for 4 h. It also showed a moderate thermal stability since it retained 90% of its activity when incubated at 50 degrees C, 30 min, making this enzyme a potential use in the animal feed and paper and pulp industries. 
8085821	19940801	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	The cel3 gene of Agaricus bisporus codes for a modular cellulase and is transcriptionally regulated by the carbon source.	A 52-kDa protein, CEL3, has been separated from the culture filtrate of Agaricus bisporus during growth on cellulose. A PCR-derived probe was made, with a degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide derived from the amino acid sequence of a CEL3 CNBr cleavage product and was used to select cel3 cDNA clones from an A. bisporus cDNA library. Two allelic cDNAs were isolated. They showed 98.8% identity of their nucleotide sequences. The deduced amino acid sequence and domain architecture of CEL3 showed a high degree of similarity to those of cellobiohydrolase II of Trichoderma reesei. Functional expression of cel3 cDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was achieved by placing it under the control of a constitutive promoter and fusing it to the yeast invertase signal sequence. Recombinant CEL3 secreted by yeast showed enzymatic activity towards crystalline cellulose. At long reaction times, CEL3 was also able to degrade carboxymethyl cellulose. Northern (RNA) analysis showed that cel3 gene expression was induced by cellulose and repressed by glucose, fructose, 2-deoxyglucose, and lactose. Glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, and maltose were neutral carbon sources. Nuclear run-on analysis showed that the rate of synthesis of cel3 mRNA in cellulose-grown cultures was 13 times higher than that in glucose-grown cultures. A low basal rate of cel3 mRNA synthesis was observed in the nuclei isolated from glucose-grown mycelia. 
3440521	19870101	Gene	D016428 D013486 	Analysis of nucleotide sequences of two ligninase cDNAs from a white-rot filamentous fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	An analysis of nucleotide sequences of two types of ligninase cDNAs isolated from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium, designated CLG4 and CLG5, are presented here. The amino acid sequences of the corresponding ligninase proteins, designated LG4 and LG5, respectively, have been deduced from the cDNA sequences. Mature ligninases LG4 and LG5 are preceded by leader sequences containing 28 and 27 amino acids (aa), respectively, and each contains 344 aa residues. The estimated Mrs of mature LG4 and LG5 are 36,540 and 36,607, respectively. Potential N-glycosylation site(s) with the general sequence Asn-X-Thr/Ser are found in both LG4 and LG5. Nucleotide sequence homology between the coding region of CLG4 and CLG5 is 71.5%, whereas the amino acid sequence homology between the two ligninases is 68.5%. The codon usage of ligninases is extremely biased in favor of codons rich in cytosine and guanine. Amino acid sequences of two tryptic peptides of ligninase H8 have exactly matching sequences in ligninase LG5. Also, the sequences of the oligodeoxynucleotide probes, which correspond to the sequences in the tryptic peptides of ligninase H8 and which were used in isolating the ligninase clones from the cDNA library, have exactly matching sequences in CLG5. The experimentally determined N-terminal sequence of purified ligninase H8 is found in the deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence of LG5. These results suggest that CLG5 encodes ligninase H8 and that CLG4 represents a related but different ligninase gene. 
8698653	19960101	J._Appl._Bacteriol.	D016428 	Characterization of the heterologous invertase produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe from the SUC2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	In order to gain information on the ability of Schizosaccharomyces pombe to process heterologous glycoproteins, the heterologous invertase, obtained from the expression in Schiz. pombe of the SUC2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was characterized. In Schiz. pombe the heterologous invertase is secreted into the cell wall and seems to be firmly bound to this structure. After the isolation of the heterologous invertase the study of its enzymatic characteristics revealed that it is more similar to the Sacch. cerevisiae external invertase than to the Schiz. pombe invertase. However, it is glycosylated like the Schiz. pombe invertase since it reacts with the lectin from Bandeiraea simplicifolia seeds conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, which indicates the presence of terminal galactose residues in the enzyme. Moreover, the presence of galactose in the heterologous invertase has been confirmed after analysis of the sugars present in its carbohydrate moiety by gas liquid chromatography. 
21161225	20101217	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 	Expression and characterization of fifteen Rhizopus oryzae 99-880 polygalacturonase enzymes in Pichia pastoris.	Polygalacturonase (PG) enzymes hydrolyze the long polygalacturonic acid chains found in the smooth regions of pectin. Interest in this enzyme class continues due to their ability to macerate tissues of economically important crops and their use in a number of industrial processes. Rhizopus oryzae has a large PG gene family with 15 of 18 genes encoding unique active enzymes. The PG enzymes, 12 endo-PG and 3 exo-galacturonases, were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified enabling biochemical characterization to gain insight into the maintenance of this large gene family within the Rhizopus genome. The 15 PG enzymes have a pH optima ranging from 4.0 to 5.0. Temperature optima of the 15 PG enzymes vary from 30 to 40 °C. While the pH and temperature optima do little to separate the enzymes, the specific activity of the enzymes is highly variable ranging from over 200 to less than 1 μmol/min/mg. A general pattern related to the groupings found in the phylogentic tree was visible with the group containing the exo-PG enzymes demonstrating the lowest specific activity. Finally, the progress curves of the PG enzymes, contained within the phylogenetic group that includes the exo-PG enzymes, acting on trigalacturonic acid lend additional support to the idea that the ancestral form of PG in Rhizopus is endolytic and exolytic function evolved later. 
19060394	20081209	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Gene cloning of cellobiohydrolase II from the white rot fungus Irpex lacteus MC-2 and its expression in Pichia pastoris.	A gene (cel4) coding for a cellobiohydrolase II (Ex-4) was isolated from the white rot basidiomycete, Irpex lacteus strain MC-2. The cel4 ORF was composed of 452 amino acid residues and was interrupted by eight introns. Its deduced amino acid sequence revealed a multi domain structure composed of a cellulose-binding domain, a linker, and a catalytic domain belonging to family 6 of glycosyl hydrolases, from the N-terminus. cel4 cDNA was successfully expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Recombinant Ex-4 showed endo-processive degrading activity towards cellulosic substrates, and a synergistic effect in the degradation of Avicel was observed when the enzyme acted together with either cellobiohydrolase I (Ex-1) or endoglucanase (En-1) produced by I. lacteus MC-2. 
22444635	20120327	Bioresour._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a β-glucosidase with transgalactosylation capacity from the zygomycete Rhizomucor miehei.	An extracellular β-glucosidase from the zygomycete Rhizomucor miehei NRRL 5282 cultivated in a wheat bran-based solid state fermentation system was characterized. The purified enzyme exhibited an optimum temperature of 68-70 °C and pH of 5.0. It efficiently hydrolyzed oligosaccharides having β-(1→4) glycosidic linkages and exhibited some β- and α-galactosidase activity. The V(max) for p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and cellobiose was 468.2 and 115.5 U/mg, respectively, while the K(m) was 0.12 mM for both substrates. The enzyme had transglucosylation and transgalactosylation activities resulting in the formation of glycosides from cellobiose, lactose and ethanol. The enzyme increased the amounts of free phenolic antioxidants in sour cherry pomace indicating that its hydrolyzing activity could potentially be applicable to improve the bioavailability of these compounds. 
2760033	19890815	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013486 D013487 	Manganese-dependent peroxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Primary structure deduced from cDNA sequence.	A cDNA clone encoding a manganese-dependent peroxidase from the filamentous fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was isolated and characterized. The clone, lambda MP-1, was isolated by screening a lambda gt11 expression library with polyclonal antibodies raised against a purified manganese-dependent peroxidase (isozyme H4, pI 4.5). The lambda MP-1 cDNA sequence predicts a mature protein containing 358 amino acids with a molecular weight of 37,711 preceded by a leader peptide of 24 amino acid residues. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of a purified manganese-dependent peroxidase (H4) corresponds to the sequence deduced from the cDNA. Some homology (58% in nucleotide sequence and 65% in amino acid sequence) is observed between the manganese-dependent peroxidase and lignin peroxidase isozyme H8. The highest degree of similarity is observed near the enzyme active site. Residues essential for peroxidase activity, the distal and proximal histidines, can be identified in the amino acid sequence. Near these residues, homology is also observed with several other peroxidases. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from nitrogen-limited P. chrysosporium cultures indicates that the level of messenger RNA correlates with expression of the enzyme and its activity. This is consistent with the regulation of the enzyme being at the level of transcription. 
17115208	20061123	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and heterologous expression of a new xylanase gene from Plectosphaerella cucumerina.	A gene encoding a new xylanase, named xynZG, was cloned by the genome-walking PCR method from the nematophagous fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The genomic DNA sequence of xynZG contains a 780 bp open reading frame separated by two introns with the sizes of 50 and 46 bp. To our knowledge, this would be the first functional gene cloned from P. cucumerina. The 684 bp cDNA was cloned into vector pHBM905B and transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115 to select xylanase-secreting transformants on RBB-xylan containing plate. The optimal secreting time was 3 days at 25 degrees C and enzymatic activities in the culture supernatants reached the maximum level of 362 U ml(-1). The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 19 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified enzyme is 6 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The purified enzyme is stable at room temperature for at least 10 h. The Km and Vmax values for birchwood xylan are 2.06 mg ml(-1) and 0.49 mmol min(-1)mg(-1), respectively. The inhibitory effects of various mental ions were investigated. It is interesting to note that Cu2+ ion, which strongly inhibits most other xylanases studied, reduces enzyme activity by only 40%. Furthermore, enzyme activity is unaffected by EDTA even at a concentration of 5 mM. 
23261999	20121225	Bioresour._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Extracellular enzyme production and phylogenetic distribution of yeasts in wastewater treatment systems.	The abilities of yeasts to produce different extracellular enzymes and their distribution characteristics were studied in municipal, inosine fermentation, papermaking, antibiotic fermentation, and printing and dyeing wastewater treatment systems. The results indicated that of the 257 yeasts, 16, 14, 55, and 11 produced lipase, protease, manganese dependant peroxidase (MnP), and lignin peroxidase (LiP), respectively. They were distributed in 12 identified and four unidentified genera, in which Candida rugosa (AA-M17) and an unidentified Saccharomycetales (AA-Y5), Pseudozyma sp. (PH-M15), Candida sp. (MO-Y11), and Trichosporon montevideense (MO-M16) were shown to have the highest activity of lipase, protease, Mnp, and LiP, respectively. No yeast had amylase, cellulose, phytase, or laccase activity. Although only 60 isolates produced ligninolytic enzymes, 249 of the 257 yeasts could decolorize different dyes through the mechanism of biodegradation (222 isolates) or bio-sorption. The types of extracellular enzymes that the yeasts produced were significantly shaped by the types of wastewater treated. 
10923795	20000803	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Purification, characterization, and molecular cloning of acidophilic xylanase from penicillium sp.40.	Penicillum sp. 40, which can grow in an extremely acidic medium at pH 2.0 was screened from an acidic soil. This fungus produces xylanases when grown in a medium containing xylan as a sole carbon source. A major xylanase was purified from the culture supernatant of Penicillium sp. 40 and designated XynA. The molecular mass of XynA was estimated to be 25,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. XynA has an optimum pH at 2.0 and is stable in pH 2.0-5.0. Western blot analysis using anit-XynA antibody showed that XynA was induced by xylan and repressed by glucose. Also, its production was increased by an acidic medium. The gene encoding XynA (xynA) was isolated from the genomic library of Penicillium sp. 40. The structural part of xynA was found to be 721 bp. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA amplified by RT-PCR showed that the open reading frame of xynA was interrupted by a single intron which was 58 bp in size and encoded 221 amino acids. Direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the precursor of XynA had a signal peptide composed of 31 amino acids. The molecular mass caliculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of XynA is 20,713. This is lower than that estimated by gel electrophoresis, suggesting that XynA is a glycoprotein. The predicted amino acid sequence of XynA has strong similarity to other family xylanases from fungi. 
19000618	20081113	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and properties of an extracellular beta-xylosidase from Aspergillus japonicus and sequence analysis of the encoding gene.	An extracellular protein exhibiting beta-xylosidase activity was purified from the culture filtrate of a filamentous fungus, Aspergillus japonicus strain MU-2, grown on oat spelt xylan. The purified enzyme was a monomeric glycoprotein with an apparent M(r) of 113.2 kDa as estimated by SDS-PAGE. beta-Xylosidase activity was optimal at pH 4.0 and 70 degrees C. The enzyme also showed beta-glucosidase and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase activities. The genomic DNA and cDNA encoding this protein were cloned and sequenced. Southern blot analysis indicated that the beta-xylosidase gene (xylA) was present as a single copy in the genome. An open reading frame, consisting of 2412 bp, was not interrupted by introns, and it encoded a presumed signal peptide of 17 amino acids and a mature protein of 787 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the xylA gene product showed a high degree of identity (69%) to the primary structure of the Aspergillus niger beta-xylosidase XlnD that belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 3. Moreover, the xylA gene was functionally expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. 
15450181	20040929	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 	The inhibition specificity of recombinant Penicillium funiculosum xylanase B towards wheat proteinaceous inhibitors.	The filamentous fungus Penicillium funiculosum produces a mixture of modular and non-modular xylanases belonging to different glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. In the present study, we heterologously expressed the cDNA encoding GH11 xylanase B (XYNB) and studied the enzymatic properties of the recombinant enzyme. Expression in Escherichia coli led to the partial purification of a glutathione fusion protein from the soluble fraction whereas the recombinant protein produced in Pichia pastoris was successfully purified using a one-step chromatography. Despite O-glycosylation heterogeneity, the purified enzyme efficiently degraded low viscosity xylan [K(m)=40+/-3 g l(-1), V(max)=16.1+/-0.8 micromol xylose min(-1) and k(cat)=5405+/-150 s(-1) at pH 4.2 and 45 degrees C] and medium viscosity xylan [K(m)=34.5+/-3.2 g l(-1), V(max)=14.9+/-1.0 micromol xylose min(-1)k(cat)=4966+/-333 s(-1) at pH 4.2 and 45 degrees C]. XYNB was further tested for its ability to interact with wheat xylanase inhibitors. The xylanase activity of XYNB produced in P. pastoris was strongly inhibited by both XIP-I and TAXI-I in a competitive manner, with a K(i) of 89.7+/-8.5 and 2.9+/-0.3 nM, respectively, whereas no inhibition was detected with TAXI-II. Physical interaction of both TAXI-I and XIP-I with XYNB was observed using titration curves across a pH range 3-9. 
8836148	19960915	Biochem._J.	D016428 	Raw-starch-digesting and thermostable alpha-amylase from the yeast Cryptococcus sp. S-2: purification, characterization, cloning and sequencing.	A starch-degrading enzyme produced by the yeast Cryptococcus sp. S-2 was purified in only one step by using an alpha-cyclodextrin-Sepharose 6B column, and was characterized as an alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1). The molecular mass and isoelectric point of purified alpha-amylase (AMY-CS2) were estimated to be 66 kDa and 4.2 respectively. AMY-CS2 has raw-starch-digesting and raw-starch-absorbing activities. Furthermore it was shown to be thermostable. An open reading frame of the cDNA specified 611 amino acids, including a putative signal peptide of 20 amino acids. The N-terminal region of AMY-CS2 (from the N-terminus to position 496) had 49.7% similarity with the whole region of alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae (Taka-amylase), whereas the C-terminal region had a sequence that was similar to the C-terminal region of glucoamylase G1 from A. niger. In addition, putative raw-starch-binding motifs exist in some amylolytic enzymes. A mutant AMY-CS2 that lacks the C-terminal domain lost not only its ability to bind or digest raw starch, but also its thermostability. Consequently it is possible that the putative raw-starch-binding domain of AMY-CS2 plays a role not only in the molecule's raw-starch-digesting ability but also in its thermostability. 
16233798	20051020	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Identification, cloning, and characterization of a Sporobolomyces singularis beta-galactosidase-like enzyme involved in galacto-oligosaccharide production.	Sporobolomyces singularis can be used as a biocatalyst in galacto-oligosaccharide production. We isolated 2-deoxy-D-glucose-resistant mutants of S. singularis ATCC 24193 and recovered a mutant that showed 10-fold higher beta-galactosidase-like activity than the parent strain and which was insensitive to catabolite repression. Thereafter, the beta-galactosidase-like enzyme was purified from the mutant and revealed to be a glycoprotein with both beta-glucosidase- and beta-galactosidase-like activity, the Michaelis-Menten constants of which for o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside were 5.40 and 1.96 mM, respectively, and the maximum velocities were 3.07 and 2.30 micromol/min per mg of protein, respectively. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 73.9 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 146 kDa by gel filtration, suggesting that it has a homodimeric structure. We sequenced the N-terminus and internal peptides of this protein and isolated both a cDNA and a gene with degenerate primers. The gene, named bg l A, has 18 introns and 19 exons and encodes a polypeptide of 594 amino acids. The Bg l A protein was approximately 35% identical and 50% similar to plant beta-glucosidases belonging to family 1 glycosyl hydrolases, but with a unique 110-amino-acid sequence at the N-terminus. The beta-galactosidase-like enzyme (i.e., Bg l A protein) in S. singularis is a beta-glucosidase with high transgalactosidase activity. 
11737205	20011212	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Homologous expression and characterization of Cel61A (EG IV) of Trichoderma reesei.	There are currently four proteins in family 61 of the glycoside hydrolases, from Trichoderma reesei, Agaricus bisporus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Neurospora crassa. The enzymatic activity of these proteins has not been studied thoroughly. We report here the homologous expression and purification of T. reesei Cel61A [previously named endoglucanase (EG) IV]. The enzyme was expressed in high amounts with a histidine tag on the C-terminus and purified by metal affinity chromatography. This is the first time that a histidine tag has been used as a purification aid in the T. reesei expression system. The enzyme activity was studied on a series of carbohydrate polymers. The only activity exhibited by Cel61A was an endoglucanase activity observed on substrates containing beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds, e.g. carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) and beta-glucan. The endoglucanase activity on CMC and beta-glucan was determined by viscosity analysis, by measuring the production of reducing ends and by following the degradation of the polymer on a size exclusion chromatography system. The formation of soluble sugars by Cel61A from microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel; Merck), phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC), and CMC were analysed on a HPLC system. Cel61A produced small amounts of oligosaccharides from these substrates. Furthermore, Cel61A showed activity against cellotetraose and cellopentaose. The activity of Cel61A was several orders of magnitude lower compared to Cel7B (previously EG I) of T. reesei on all substrates. One significant difference between Cel61A and Cel7B was that cellotriose was a poor substrate for Cel61A but was readily hydrolysed by Cel7B. The enzyme activity for Cel61A was further studied on a large number of carbohydrate substrates but the enzyme showed no activity towards any of these substrates.

D016428 D013485 	Substrate and positional specificity of feruloyl esterases for monoferuloylated and monoacetylated 4-nitrophenyl glycosides.	4-Nitrophenyl glycosides of 2-, 3-, and 5-O-(E)-feruloyl- and 2- and 5-O-acetyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranosides and of 2-, 3-, and 4-O-(E)-feruloyl- and 2-, 3- and 4-O-acetyl-beta-D-xylopyranosides, compounds mimicking natural substrates, were used to investigate substrate and positional specificity of type-A, -B, and -C feruloyl esterases. All the feruloyl esterases behave as true feruloyl esterases showing negligible activity on sugar acetates. Type-A enzymes, represented by AnFaeA from Aspergillus niger and FoFaeII from Fusarium oxysporum, are specialized for deferuloylation of primary hydroxyl groups, with a very strong preference for hydrolyzing 5-O-feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside. On the contrary, type-B and -C feruloyl esterases, represented by FoFaeI from F. oxysporum and TsFaeC from Talaromyces stipitatus, acted on almost all ferulates with exception of 4- and 3-O-feruloyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside. 5-O-Feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside was the best substrate for both TsFaeC and FoFaeI, although catalytic efficiency of the latter enzyme toward 2-O-feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside was comparable. In comparison with acetates, the corresponding ferulates served as poor substrates for the carbohydrate esterase family 1 feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus oryzae. The enzyme hydrolyzed all alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and beta-D-xylopyranoside acetates. It behaved as a non-specific acetyl esterase rather than a feruloyl esterase, with a preference for 2-O-acetyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside. 
17487548	20070510	Biotechnol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Identification of two novel xylanase-encoding genes (xyn5 and xyn6) from Acrophialophora nainiana and heterologous expression of xyn6 in Trichoderma reesei.	Two novel genes, xyn5 and xyn6, coding for family 11 xylanases, were isolated from the thermotolerant filamentous fungus, Acrophialophora nainiana, by PCR using degenerate primers. The xyn6 gene was further expressed in Trichoderma reesei. DNA sequence analysis of xyn6 revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 708 bp, interrupted by an intron of 58 bp. The xyn6 ORF encodes a predicted protein of 236 amino acid residues. The mature recombinant XynVI protein had a molecular mass of about 19 kDa, as estimated by gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of XynVI paves the way for rational protein engineering by site-directed mutagenesis aiming to increase the thermostability of the heterologously-expressed xylanase. 
7750151	19941201	Curr._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of a chitinase (chit42) cDNA from the mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma harzianum.	A cDNA of Trichoderma harzianum (chit42), coding for an endochitinase of 42 kDa, has been cloned using synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to amino-acid sequences of the purified chitinase. The cDNA codes for a protein of 423 amino acids. Analysis of the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of the chitinase, and comparison with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence, revealed post-translational processing of a putative signal peptide of 22 amino acids and a second peptide of 12 amino acids. The chit42 sequence presents overall similarities with filamentous fungal and bacterial chitinases and to a lesser extent with yeast and plant chitinases. The deduced amino-acid sequence has putative catalytic, phosphorylation and glycosylation domains. Expression of chit42 mRNA is strongly induced by chitin and chitin-containing cell walls and is subjected to catabolite repression. Southern analysis shows that it is present as a single-copy gene in T. harzianum. chit42 is also detected in several tested mycoparasitic and non-mycoparasitic fungal strains. 
9463945	19980217	Enzyme_Microb._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Substrate specificities of Penicillium simplicissimum alpha-galactosidases.	The substrate specificities of three Penicillium simplicissimum alpha-galactosidases, AGLI, AGLII, and AGLIII, were determined by using various isolated galactose-containing oligosaccharides and polymeric galacto(gluco)mannans. AGLI released galactose from melibiose and raffinose-family oligosaccharides but the amount of galactose released was decreased from 96% to 35% by the increasing chain length of the substrate from raffinose to verbascose. It was able to release galactose linked to the nonreducing end and less efficiently to the internal residues of the galactomanno-oligomers. AGLI was able to hydrolyze 60-92% of galactose from polymeric galacto(gluco)mannans alone but its action was facilitated by mannanase and beta-mannosidase. In addition, it was able to release about 10% of the galactose from softwood kraft pulp alone and about 22% in combination with mannanase. AGLII was highly specific toward small galactose-containing oligosaccharides in which the galactose is linked to the nonreducing end of the substrate. It released 90-100% of galactose present in melibiose, raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose; however, it was able to degrade polymeric substrates only in combination with mannanase and beta-mannosidase. AGLIII had only low activity toward the oligomeric substrates tested. It was able to release some galactose from the polymeric galacto(gluco)mannans alone, but its action was clearly enhanced by the backbone degrading enzymes. 
21302145	20110209	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and properties of a psychrotrophic Trichoderma sp. xylanase and its gene sequence.	A psychrotrophic fungus identified as Trichoderma sp. SC9 produced 36.7 U/ml of xylanase when grown on a medium containing corncob xylan at 20 °C for 6 days. The xylanase was purified 37-fold with a recovery yield of 8.2%. The purified xylanase appeared as a single protein band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of approximately 20.5 kDa. The enzyme had an optimal pH of 6.0, and was stable over pH 3.5-9.0. The optimal temperature of the xylanase was 42.5 °C and it was stable up to 35 °C at pH 6.0 for 30 min. The xylanase was thermolabile with a half-life of 23.9 min at 45 °C. The apparent K(m) values of the xylanase for birchwood, beechwood, and oat-spelt xylans were found to be 3, 2.1, and 16 mg/ml respectively. The xylanase hydrolyzed beechwood xylan and birchwood xylan to yield mainly xylobiose as end products. The enzyme-hydrolysed xylotriose, xylotetraose, and xylopentose to produce xylobiose, but it hardly hydrolysed xylobiose. A xylanase gene (xynA) with an open reading frame of 669 nucleotide base pairs (bp), encoding 222 amino acids, from the strain was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of XynA showed 85% homology with Xyn2 from a mesophilic strain of Trichoderma viride. 
7574642	19950901	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D003160 D016428 D013486 	Isolation and characterization of polygalacturonase genes (pecA and pecB) from Aspergillus flavus.	Two genes, pecA and pecB, encoding endopolyglacturonases were cloned from a highly aggressive strain of Aspergillus flavus. The pecA gene consisted of 1,228 bp encoding a protein of 363 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 37.6 kDa, interrupted by two introns of 58 and 81 bp in length. Accumulation of pecA mRNA in both pectin- or glucose-grown mycelia in the highly aggressive strain matched the activity profile of a pectinase previously identified as P2c. Transformants of a weakly aggressive strain containing a functional copy of the pecA gene produced P2c in vitro, confirming that pecA encodes P2c. The coding region of pecB was determined to be 1,217 bp in length interrupted by two introns of 65 and 54 bp in length. The predicted protein of 366 amino acids had an estimated molecular mass of 38 kDa. Transcripts of this gene accumulated in mycelia grown in medium containing pectin alone, never in mycelia grown in glucose-containing medium, for both highly and weakly aggressive strains. Thus, pecB encodes the activity previously identified as P1 or P3. pecA and pecB share a high degree of sequence identity with polygalacturonase genes from Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus oryzae, further establishing the close relationships between members of the A. flavus group. Conservation of intron positions in these genes also indicates that they share a common ancestor with genes encoding endopolyglacturonases of Aspergillus niger. 
17549471	20070606	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Production in Trichoderma reesei of three xylanases from Chaetomium thermophilum: a recombinant thermoxylanase for biobleaching of kraft pulp.	Three endoxylanase genes were cloned from the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum CBS 730.95. All genes contained the typical consensus sequence of family 11 glycoside hydrolases. Genomic copies of Ct xyn11A, Ct xyn11B, and Ct xyn11C were expressed in the filamentous fungus T. reesei under the control of the strong T. reesei cel7A (cellobiohydrolase 1, cbh1) promoter. The molecular masses of the Ct Xyn11A, Ct Xyn11B, and Ct Xyn11C proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were 27, 23, and 22 kDa, respectively. Ct Xyn11A was produced almost as efficiently as the homologous xylanase II from a corresponding single-copy transformant strain. Ct Xyn11B production level was approximately half of that of Ct Xyn11A. The amount of Ct Xyn11C was remarkably lower. Ct Xyn11A had the highest temperature optimum and stability of the recombinant xylanases and the highest activity at acid-neutral pH (pH 5-7). It was the most suitable for industrial bleaching of kraft pulp at high temperature. 
16861813	20060725	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Functional analysis of an endo-1,6-beta-D-glucanase gene (neg-1) from Neurospora crassa.	The 1,6-beta-D-glucanase gene (neg1) of Neurospora crassa was disrupted by repeat-induced point mutations. Sequence analysis of the neg1 gene in the R12-1 mutant showed that 9 nucleotides within the coding region of the gene changed from GC to AT. The base transition of C to A at position 662 resulted in a codon. No apparent phenotypic changes were observed in the mutant, but Congo-red, SDS, and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), which affect fungal cell walls or membranes, markedly inhibited the hyphal growth of the mutant at a concentration that does not inhibit growth in the wild type. 
9335168	19971023	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Oligosaccharide specificity of a family 7 endoglucanase: insertion of potential sugar-binding subsites.	Family 7 of the glycosyl hydrolases contains both endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases. In addition to their different catalytic activities on crystalline substrates, the cellobiohydrolases differ from the endoglucanases in their activity on longer soluble substrates, indicative of a greater number of subsites on the enzyme. A double mutant (S37W, P39W) of the Humicola insolens endoglucanase I (EG I) has been constructed in order to mimic aspects of the subsite structure of the corresponding family 7 cellobiohydrolase, cellobiohydrolase-I (CBH I). The 3-D crystal structure of the double mutant has been solved and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.17 at a resolution of 2.2 A (1 A = 0.1 nm). The two mutant tryptophans are clearly visible in the electron density and are in the same orientation as those found in the substrate binding groove of CBH I. In addition to the substitutions, the C-terminal amino acids (399QELQ), disordered in the native enzyme structure, are clearly visible and there are a small number of minor loop movements associated with differences in crystal packing. Kinetic determinations show that the S37W, P39W mutant EG I has almost identical activity, compared to native EG I, on small soluble cellodextrins. On phosphoric acid swollen cellulose there is a small (30%), but significant, decrease in the apparent KM indicating that the double mutant may indeed exhibit stronger binding to longer polymeric substrates. 
16330537	20051207	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Exploration of glycosyl hydrolase family 75, a chitosanase from Aspergillus fumigatus.	A powerful endo-chitosanase (CSN) previously described for a large scale preparation of chito-oligosaccharides (Cheng, C.-Y., and Li, Y.-K. (2000) Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 32, 197-203) was cloned from Aspergillus fumigatus and further identified as a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 75. We report here a study of gene expression, functional characterization, and mutation analysis of this enzyme. Gene cloning was accomplished by reverse transcription-PCR and inverse PCR. Within the 1382-bp Aspergillus gene (GenBank accession number AY190324), two introns (67 and 82 bp) and an open reading frame encoding a 238-residue protein containing a 17-residue signal peptide were characterized. The recombinant mature protein was overexpressed as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli, rescued by treatment with 5 m urea, and subsequently purified by cation exchange chromatography. A time course 1H NMR study on the enzymatic formation of chito-oligosaccharides confirmed that this A. fumigatus CSN is an inverting enzyme. Tandem mass spectrum analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysate revealed that the recombinant CSN can cleave linkages of GlcNAc-GlcN and GlcN-GlcN in its substrate, suggesting that it is a subclass I chitosanase. In addition, an extensive site-directed mutagenesis study on 10 conserved carboxylic amino acids of glycosyl hydrolase family 75 was performed. This showed that among these various mutants, D160N and E169Q lost nearly all activity. Further investigation using circular dichroism measurements of D160N, E169Q, wild-type CSN, and other active mutants showed similar spectra, indicating that the loss of enzymatic activity in D160N and E169Q was not because of changes in protein structure but was caused by loss of the catalytic essential residue. We conclude that Asp160 and Glu169 are the essential residues for the action of A. fumigatus endo-chitosanase. 
7764056	19930601	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning of the Aspergillus niger gene encoding alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase A.	Using L-arabitol as an inducer, simple induction conditions were established that resulted in high-level expression of alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase A by an Aspergillus niger D-xylulose kinase mutant strain. These conditions were adapted to construct a cDNA expression library from which an alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase A cDNA clone was isolated using specific antiserum. The corresponding gene encoding alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase A (abfA) was isolated from a genomic library and cloned into a high copy plasmid vector. By co-transformation of uridine auxotrophic mutants lacking orotidine-5-phosphate decarboxylase activity, the afbA gene was introduced both in A. niger and A. nidulans, using the A. niger pyrA gene as selection marker. The identity of the abfA gene was confirmed by overexpression of the gene product by A. niger and A. nidulans transformants, upon growth using sugar beet pulp as the carbon source.

An exo-beta-D-glucosaminidase gene was cloned from Aspergillus sp. CJ22-326 and expressed in Escherichia coli.

11722900	20011128	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Degradation of xylan to D-xylose by recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae coexpressing the Aspergillus niger beta-xylosidase (xlnD) and the Trichoderma reesei xylanase II (xyn2) genes.	The beta-xylosidase-encoding xlnD gene of Aspergillus niger 90196 was amplified by the PCR technique from first-strand cDNA synthesized on mRNA isolated from the fungus. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment was verified to contain a 2,412-bp open reading frame that encodes a 804-amino-acid propeptide. The 778-amino-acid mature protein, with a putative molecular mass of 85.1 kDa, was fused in frame with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating factor alpha1 signal peptide (MFalpha1(s)) to ensure correct posttranslational processing in yeast. The fusion protein was designated Xlo2. The recombinant beta-xylosidase showed optimum activity at 60 degrees C and pH 3.2 and optimum stability at 50 degrees C. The K(i(app)) value for D-xylose and xylobiose for the recombinant beta-xylosidase was determined to be 8.33 and 6.41 mM, respectively. The XLO2 fusion gene and the XYN2 beta-xylanase gene from Trichoderma reesei, located on URA3-based multicopy shuttle vectors, were successfully expressed and coexpressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene (ADH2) promoter and terminator. These recombinant S. cerevisiae strains produced 1,577 nkat/ml of beta-xylanase activity when expressing only the beta-xylanase and 860 nkat/ml when coexpressing the beta-xylanase with the beta-xylosidase. The maximum beta-xylosidase activity was 5.3 nkat/ml when expressed on its own and 3.5 nkat/ml when coexpressed with the beta-xylanase. Coproduction of the beta-xylanase and beta-xylosidase enabled S. cerevisiae to degrade birchwood xylan to D-xylose. 
23190610	20121130	AMB_Express	D016428 	Screening of white-rot fungi manganese peroxidases: a comparison between the specific activities of the enzyme from different native producers.	 In this study manganese peroxidase (MnP) enzymes from selected white-rot fungi were isolated and compared for potential future recombinant production. White-rot fungi were cultivated in small-scale in liquid media and a simplified process was established for the purification of extracellular enzymes.Five lignin degrading organisms were selected (Bjerkandera sp., Phanerochaete (P.) chrysosporium, Physisporinus (P.) rivulosus, Phlebia (P.) radiata and Phlebia sp. Nf b19) and studied for MnP production in small-scale. Extracellular MnP activity was followed and cultivations were harvested at proximity of the peak activity. The production of MnPs varied in different organisms but was clearly regulated by inducing liquid media components (Mn2+, veratryl alcohol and malonate). In total 8 different MnP isoforms were purified.Results of this study reinforce the conception that MnPs from distinct organisms differ substantially in their properties. Production of the extracellular enzyme in general did not reach a substantial level. This further suggests that these native producers are not suitable for industrial scale production of the enzyme. The highest specific activities were observed with MnPs from P. chrysosporium (200 U mg-1), Phlebia sp. Nf b19 (55 U mg-1) and P. rivulosus (89 U mg-1) and these MnPs are considered as the most potential candidates for further studies. The molecular weight of the purified MnPs was estimated to be between 45-50 kDa. 
10675564	20000217	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a novel endopolygalacturonase from Aspergillus niger with unique kinetic properties.	We isolated and characterized a new type of endopolygalacturonase (PG)-encoding gene, pgaD, from Aspergillus niger. The primary structure of PGD differs from that of other A. niger PGs by a 136 amino acid residues long N-terminal extension. Biochemical analysis demonstrated extreme processive behavior of the enzyme on oligomers longer than five galacturonate units. Furthermore, PGD is the only A. niger PG capable of hydrolyzing di-galacturonate. It is tentatively concluded that the enzyme is composed of four subsites. The physiological role of PGD is discussed.

D016428 D013485 	Cloning of the gene Lecanicillium psalliotae chitinase Lpchi1 and identification of its potential role in the biocontrol of root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita.	The nematophagous fungus Lecanicillium psalliotae (syn. Verticillium psalliotae) is a well-known biocontrol agent. In this study, a chitinase gene Lpchi1 was isolated for the first time from L. psalliotae using degenerate primers and DNA-walking technique. The cloned gene Lpchi1 encoding 423 amino acid residues shares a high degree of homology with other pathogenicity-related chitinases from entomopathogenic and mycoparasitic fungi. The complementary DNA sequence of the mature chitinase was amplified via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and expressed well in Pichia pastoris GS115. Through gel filtration, the recombinant chitinase was purified as a protein of ca. 45 kDa with an optimal activity at pH 7.0 and 37.6 degrees C. The purified chitinase LPCHI1 was found degrading chitinous components of eggs of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and significantly influence its development. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that the protease Ver112 and the chitinase LPCHI1 from the same fungus interacted on the egg infection.

D016428 D013486 D013487 	Heterologous expression of active manganese peroxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium using the baculovirus expression system.	The cDNA encoding Mn peroxidase isozyme H4 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium was recombined into a baculovirus and heterologously expressed in Sf9 cells. The recombinant Mn peroxidase has the same molecular weight as the native enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE and cross-reacts with a Mn peroxidase-specific antibody. The recombinant enzyme has a slightly lower pI than the native fungal isozyme H4 indicating some differences in post-translational modification. Phenol red, guaiacol, and vanillylacetone, substrates of the native Mn peroxidase, are oxidized by the recombinant enzyme. All of the activities are dependent on both Mn (II) and H2O2. 
21965406	20111004	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Endo-β-1,3-glucanase GLU1, from the fruiting body of Lentinula edodes, belongs to a new glycoside hydrolase family.	The cell wall of the fruiting body of the mushroom Lentinula edodes is degraded after harvesting by enzymes such as β-1,3-glucanase. In this study, a novel endo-type β-1,3-glucanase, GLU1, was purified from L. edodes fruiting bodies after harvesting. The gene encoding it, glu1, was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR using primers designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of GLU1. The putative amino acid sequence of the mature protein contained 247 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 26 kDa and a pI of 3.87, and recombinant GLU1 expressed in Pichia pastoris exhibited β-1,3-glucanase activity. GLU1 catalyzed depolymerization of glucans composed of β-1,3-linked main chains, and reaction product analysis by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) clearly indicated that the enzyme had an endolytic mode. However, the amino acid sequence of GLU1 showed no significant similarity to known glycoside hydrolases. GLU1 has similarity to several hypothetical proteins in fungi, and GLU1 and highly similar proteins should be classified as a novel glycoside hydrolase family (GH128). 
18548669	19830201	Biotechnol._Bioeng.	D016428 	Characterization of cellobiose fermentations to ethanol by yeasts.	Twenty-two different yeasts were screened for their ability to ferment both glucose and cellobiose. The fermentation characteristics of Candida lusitaniae (NRRL Y-5394) and C. wickerhamii (NRRL Y-2563) were selected for further study because their initial rate of ethanol production from cellobiose was faster than the other test cultures. C. lusitaniae produced 44 g/L ethanol from 90 g/L cellobiose after 5-7 days. When higher carbohydrate concentrations were employed, fermentation ceased when the ethanol concentration reached 45-60 g/L. C. lusitaniae exhibited barely detectable levels of beta-glucosidase, even though the culture actively fermented cellobiose. C. wickerhamii produced ethanol from cellobiose at a rate equivalent to C. lusitaniae; however, once the ethanol concentration reached 20 g/L, fermentation ceased. Using p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) as substrate, beta-glucosidase (3-5 U/mL) was detected when C. wickerhamii was grown anaerobically on glucose or cellobiose. About 35% of the beta-glucosidase activity was excreted into the medium. The cell-associated activity was highest against pNPG and salicin. Approximately 100-fold less activity was detected with cellobiose as substrate. When empolying these organisms in a simultaneous saccharification-fermentation of avicel, using Trichoderma reesei cellulase as the saccharifying agent, 10-30% more ethanol was produced by the two yeasts capable of fermenting cellobiose than by the control, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of Penicillium minioluteum dextranase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its exploitation as a reporter in the detection of mycotoxins.	A dextranase gene from Penicillium minioluteum (strain IMI068219) has been cloned, sequenced and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae via fusion of the DNA segment encoding the mature dextranase protein with alpha-factor signal sequence, and insertion into the GAL1-controlled expression vector pYES2/CT. Galactose-induced expression yielded extracellular dextranase activity of 0.63 units/ml and cell-associated dextranase activity of 0.48 units/ml, after 24 h incubation. The dextranase construct was introduced into a strain of S. cerevisiae expressing the human cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and the cognate reductase, which was then used to develop a microplate toxicity bioassay. Toxicity was signalled as inhibition of dextranase activity, assayed fluorimetrically. This novel bioassay was assessed using six economically significant mycotoxins. 
23236275	20121214	PLoS_Pathog.	D016428 D052060 D013486 	Diverse lifestyles and strategies of plant pathogenesis encoded in the genomes of eighteen Dothideomycetes fungi.	The class Dothideomycetes is one of the largest groups of fungi with a high level of ecological diversity including many plant pathogens infecting a broad range of hosts. Here, we compare genome features of 18 members of this class, including 6 necrotrophs, 9 (hemi)biotrophs and 3 saprotrophs, to analyze genome structure, evolution, and the diverse strategies of pathogenesis. The Dothideomycetes most likely evolved from a common ancestor more than 280 million years ago. The 18 genome sequences differ dramatically in size due to variation in repetitive content, but show much less variation in number of (core) genes. Gene order appears to have been rearranged mostly within chromosomal boundaries by multiple inversions, in extant genomes frequently demarcated by adjacent simple repeats. Several Dothideomycetes contain one or more gene-poor, transposable element (TE)-rich putatively dispensable chromosomes of unknown function. The 18 Dothideomycetes offer an extensive catalogue of genes involved in cellulose degradation, proteolysis, secondary metabolism, and cysteine-rich small secreted proteins. Ancestors of the two major orders of plant pathogens in the Dothideomycetes, the Capnodiales and Pleosporales, may have had different modes of pathogenesis, with the former having fewer of these genes than the latter. Many of these genes are enriched in proximity to transposable elements, suggesting faster evolution because of the effects of repeat induced point (RIP) mutations. A syntenic block of genes, including oxidoreductases, is conserved in most Dothideomycetes and upregulated during infection in L. maculans, suggesting a possible function in response to oxidative stress. 
7549103	19950801	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Nucleotide sequence and expression of alpha-glucosidase-encoding gene (agdA) from Aspergillus oryzae.	We have isolated an alpha-glucosidase(AGL)-encoding gene (agdA) from Aspergillus oryzae by heterologous hybridization using the corresponding Aspergillus niger gene as a probe. Southern hybridization analysis showed that the agdA gene is on a 5.0-kb ScaI fragment and there is a single copy in the A. oryzae chromosome. Comparison with the A. niger agdA gene indicated that the agdA gene contains three putative introns from 52 to 59 nucleotides long, and that it encodes 985 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of A. oryzae AGL is 78% homologous with the A. niger AGL. The high degree of homology with the amino acid sequence bordering the putative catalytic residue of a number of AGL enzymes, and this enzyme suggests that Asp492 is a catalytic residue of A. oryzae AGL. The cloned gene was functional. Transformants of A. oryzae containing multiple copies of the cloned agdA gene showed a 6-16 fold increase in AGL activity. Like the Taka-amylase A and glucoamylase genes of A. oryzae, expression of the agdA gene was induced when maltose was provided as a carbon source, but expression was not induced by glucose. This result suggested that cis-element(s) involved in maltose induction may be also present in the agdA promoter region.

Multiple chitinases have been found in hyphae of filamentous fungi, which are presumed to have various functions during hyphal growth. Here it is reported, for the first time, the primary structure of one such intracellular chitinase, named chitinase III, from Rhizopus oligosporus, a zygomycete filamentous fungus. Chitinase III was purified to homogeneity from actively growing mycelia of R. oligosporus using three steps of column chromatography. Its molecular mass was 43.5 kDa and the pH optimum was 6.0 when p-nitrophenyl N,N',N"-beta-D-triacetylchitotrioside was used as a substrate. Chitinase III also hydrolysed chromogenic derivatives of chitobiose, but had no N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. The gene encoding chitinase III (chi3) was cloned using PCR with degenerate oligonucleotide primers from the partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence of chi3 was similar to that of bacterial chitinases and chitinases from mycoparasitic fungi, such as Aphanocladium album and Trichoderma harzianum, but it had no potential secretory signal sequence in its amino terminus. Northern blot analysis showed that chi3 was transcribed during hyphal growth. These results suggest that chitinase III may function during morphogenesis in R. oligosporus.

D016428 D013485 	Sequencing and expression of the xylanase gene 2 from Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 and characterization of the recombinant enzyme and its activity on xylan.	The Xyn2 gene, which encodes endo-beta-1,4-xylanase2, in Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 was amplified by PCR from first-strand cDNA synthesized on mRNA isolated from the fungus. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment was verified to encode 190-amino-acid residues of a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 21 kDa. The cDNA was cloned into pET30alpha expression vector and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of strong bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals. The enzyme activity assay verified the recombinant protein as xylanase. The isoelectric point and highest activity were 7.5 and 1,600 U/mg, respectively. Like with the T. reesei Xyn2, the highest activity of the recombinant Xyn2 was at 50 degrees C. However, the recombinant enzyme had an improved thermostability and more than 65% of its activity retained after 30 min incubation at 60 degrees C. In addition, the recombinant Xyn2 was active over the range of pH 3.5-7.5 with maximum activity at pH 5.0. Using birchwood xylan, the determined apparent K(m) and k(cat) values were 0.15 mg/ml and 119.7 s(-1), respectively. The enzyme was highly specific towards xylans and exhibited very low activity towards cellulosic substrates. Analysis of the products from birchwood xylan degradation confirmed that the enzyme was an endo-xylanase with xylobiose and xylose as the main degradation products. These properties should make the enzyme a suitable applicant in various industrial applications. 
20419375	20100427	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Knock down of chitosanase expression in phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium solani and its effect on pathogenicity.	Chitosanases are lytic enzymes involved in the degradation of chitosan, a component of fungal cell walls. The phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium solani produces an extracellular chitosanase, CSN1, the role of which in the physiology and virulence of the fungus remains to be expounded. Here, we studied the expression of the CSN1 gene through gene silencing and examined its effect on fungal pathogenicity. A vector construct encoding a hairpin RNA (hpRNA) of CSN1 was constructed and introduced into the F. solani 0114 strain. The results revealed that majority of the transformants exhibited a significant reduction in chitosanase activity compared with the wild-type strain. Further, transformants with silenced CSN1 exhibited no change in mycelial growth and spore formation. However, pea pod and seedling bioassays indicated that transformants with silenced CSN1 were more virulent compared with the wild-type strain, and in sharp contrast to strains in which overexpression of the CSN1 gene resulted in virulence reduction. Although the mechanism remains unclear, our findings did suggest that F. solani chitosanase has a negative effect on fungal pathogenicity. 
8595669	19960201	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and sequence analysis of the invertase gene INV 1 from the yeast Pichia anomala.	A genomic library from the yeast Pichia anomala has been constructed and employed to clone the gene encoding the sucrose-hydrolysing enzyme invertase by complementation of a sucrose non-fermenting mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cloned gene, INV1, was sequenced and found to encode a polypeptide of 550 amino acids which contained a 22 amino-acid signal sequence and ten potential glycosylation sites. The amino-acid sequence shows significant identity with other yeast invertases and also with Kluyveromyces marxianus inulinase, a yeast beta-fructofuranosidase which has a different substrate specificity. The nucleotide sequences of the 5' and 3' non-coding regions were found to contain several consensus motifs probably involved in the initiation and termination of gene transcription.

D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of a novel β-1,3-1,4-glucanase (lichenase) from thermophilic Rhizomucor miehei with high specific activity and its gene sequence.	Production, purification, and characterization of a novel β-1,3-1,4-glucanase (lichenase) from thermophilic Rhizomucor miehei CAU432 were investigated. High-level extracellular β-1,3-1,4-glucanase production of 6230 U/mL was obtained when oat flour (3%, w/v) was used as a carbon source at 50 °C. The crude enzyme was purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 28818 U/mg. The molecular weight of purified enzyme was estimated to be 35.4 kDa and 33.7 kDa by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature of the enzyme were pH 5.5 and 60 °C, respectively. The K(m) values of purified β-1,3-1,4-glucanase for barley β-glucan and lichenan were 2.0 mM and 1.4 mM, respectively. Furthermore, the gene (RmLic16A) encoding the β-1,3-1,4-glucanase was cloned and its deduced amino acid sequence showed the highest identity (50%) to characterized β-1,3-1,4-glucanase from Paecilomyces thermophila. The high-level production and biochemical properties of the enzyme enable its potential industrial applications. 
15629130	20050105	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of two endoxylanases from the cereal phytopathogen Fusarium graminearum and their inhibition profile against endoxylanase inhibitors from wheat.	Two genes encoding family 11 endo-beta-1,4-xylanases (XylA, XylB) from Fusarium graminearum were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The amount of active endoxylanase in the cytoplasmic soluble fraction was considerably improved by varying different expression parameters, including host strain and temperature during induction. Both recombinant endoxylanases showed a temperature optimum around 35 degrees C and neutral pH optima (around pH 7 and 8 for XylB and XylA, respectively). For the first time this allowed one to test endoxylanases of a phytopathogenic organism for inhibition by proteinaceous endoxylanase inhibitors TAXI and XIP. Whereas XylA and XylB were inhibited by TAXI-I, no inhibition activity could be detected upon incubation with XIP-I. The insensitivity of both F. graminearum endoxylanases towards XIP is surprising, since the latter is typically active against endoxylanases produced by (aerobic) fungi. As F. graminearum is an important phytopathogen, these findings have implications for the role of endoxylanase inhibitors in plant defence. 
12485115	20021218	Biochem._J.	D016428 	beta-Glucosidase in cellulosome of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces sp. strain E2 is a family 3 glycoside hydrolase.	The cellulosomes of anaerobic fungi convert crystalline cellulose solely into glucose, in contrast with bacterial cellulosomes which produce cellobiose. Previously, a beta-glucosidase was identified in the cellulosome of Piromyces sp. strain E2 by zymogram analysis, which represented approx. 25% of the extracellular beta-glucosidase activity. To identify the component in the fungal cellulosome responsible for the beta-glucosidase activity, immunoscreening with anti-cellulosome antibodies was used to isolate the corresponding gene. A 2737 bp immunoclone was isolated from a cDNA library. The clone encoded an extracellular protein containing a eukaryotic family 3 glycoside hydrolase domain homologue and was therefore named cel3A. The C-terminal end of the encoded Cel3A protein consisted of an auxiliary domain and three fungal dockerins, typical for cellulosome components. The Cel3A catalytic domain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified. Biochemical analyses of the recombinant protein showed that the Cel3A catalytic domain was specific for beta-glucosidic bonds and functioned as an exoglucohydrolase on soluble substrates as well as cellulose. Comparison of the apparent K (m) and K (i) values of heterologous Cel3A and the fungal cellulosome for p -nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and D-glucono-1,5-delta-lactone respectively indicated that cel3A encodes the beta-glucosidase activity of the Piromyces sp. strain E2 cellulosome.

The expression of the acetyl xylan esterase II (axeII) gene from Penicillium purpurogenum is repressed by glucose and induced by xylan, as well as to a small degree by xylose and xylitol. This gene is expressed at neutral pH, but not under alkaline or acidic conditions, in agreement with previous findings for other xylanolytic genes of this organism. This is the first report showing pH regulation of an axe gene. 
6440004	19841101	Mol._Cell._Biol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and characterization of the glucoamylase gene of Aspergillus awamori.	The filamentous ascomycete Aspergillus awamori secretes large amounts of glucoamylase upon growth in medium containing starch, glucose, or a variety of hexose sugars and sugar polymers. We examined the mechanism of this carbon source-dependent regulation of glucoamylase accumulation and found a several hundredfold increase in glucoamylase mRNA in cells grown on an inducing substrate, starch, relative to cells grown on a noninducing substrate, xylose. We postulate that induction of glucoamylase synthesis is regulated transcriptionally. Comparing total mRNA from cells grown on starch and xylose, we were able to identify an inducible 2.3-kilobase mRNA-encoding glucoamylase. The glucoamylase mRNA was purified and used to identify a molecularly cloned 3.4-kilobase EcoRI fragment containing the A. awamori glucoamylase gene. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the 3.4-kilobase EcoRI fragment with that of the glucoamylase I mRNA (as determined from molecularly cloned cDNA) revealed the existence of four intervening sequences within the glucoamylase gene. The 5' end of the glucoamylase mRNA was mapped to several locations within a region -52 to -73 nucleotides from the translational start. Sequence and structural features of the glucoamylase gene of the filamentous ascomycete A. awamori were examined and compared with those reported in genes of other eucaryotes. 
11999400	20020510	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Molecular cloning, characterization, and expression analysis of the xynF3 gene from Aspergillus oryzae.	The gene encoding xylanase F3 (xynF3) was isolated from a genomic library of Aspergillus oryzae KBN616, used for making shoyu koji. The structural part of xynF3 was found to be 1468 bp. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA amplified by RT-PCR showed that the open reading frame of xynF3 was interrupted by ten short introns and encoded 323 amino acids. Direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the precursor of XynF3 had a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of XynF3 has strong similarity to other family 10 xylanases from fungi. The xynF3 gene was successfully overexpressed in A. oryzae and the XynF3 was purified. The molecular mass of XynF3 estimated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 32,000. This was almost the same as the molecular mass of 32,437 calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence. The purified XynF3 showed an optimum activity at pH 5.0 and 58 degrees C. It had a Km of 6.5 mg/ml and a Vmax of 435 micromol x min(-1) x mg(-1) when birch wood xylan was used as a substrate. Expression of the xynF3 gene was analyzed using an Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene as a reporter. The result indicated that xynF3 is expressed in the medium containing wheat bran as a carbon source.

16509822	20060303	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	The family 21 carbohydrate-binding module of glucoamylase from Rhizopus oryzae consists of two sites playing distinct roles in ligand binding.	The starch-hydrolysing enzyme GA (glucoamylase) from Rhizopus oryzae is a commonly used glycoside hydrolase in industry. It consists of a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal starch-binding domain, which belong to the CBM21 (carbohydrate-binding module, family 21). In the present study, a molecular model of CBM21 from R. oryzae GA (RoGACBM21) was constructed according to PSSC (progressive secondary structure correlation), modified structure-based sequence alignment, and site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify and characterize potential ligand-binding sites. Our model suggests that RoGACBM21 contains two ligand-binding sites, with Tyr32 and Tyr67 grouped into site I, and Trp47, Tyr83 and Tyr93 grouped into site II. The involvement of these aromatic residues has been validated using chemical modification, UV difference spectroscopy studies, and both qualitative and quantitative binding assays on a series of RoGACBM21 mutants. Our results further reveal that binding sites I and II play distinct roles in ligand binding, the former not only is involved in binding insoluble starch, but also facilitates the binding of RoGACBM21 to long-chain soluble polysaccharides, whereas the latter serves as the major binding site mediating the binding of both soluble polysaccharide and insoluble ligands. In the present study we have for the first time demonstrated that the key ligand-binding residues of RoGACBM21 can be identified and characterized by a combination of novel bioinformatics methodologies in the absence of resolved three-dimensional structural information. 
22754023	20120704	Indian_J._Microbiol.	D016428 	Studies on the Cloning and Expression of Bbchit1 Gene of Beauveria bassiana NCIM 1216.	Beauveria bassiana is a biocontrol agent which shows entomopathogenecity on insect pests especially the Lepidopterons invading the agriculturally important crops. The mode of infection is through the cuticle by degrading the chitin present on it which is enabled by the exochitinase enzyme of Bbchit1 gene. A good quality genomic DNA was isolated from Beauveria bassiana NCIM 1216 and amplified with specific primers to isolate the gene corresponding to Bbchit1 which codes for the exochitinase enzyme that is responsible for pathogenesis. The Bbchit1 gene of B. bassiana was transformed with the binary plasmid pBANF-bar-pAN-Bbchit1, in which the Bbchit1 gene was placed downstream of the constitutive gpd promoter, which was mediated by A. tumefaciens, and transformants were selected on the basis of herbicide resistance. Fifty herbicide resistant colonies were obtained and analyzed. The exochitinase produced by these transformants was observed maximum on the 7th day of inoculation in both which was 0.09 μmol/ml/min for the purified fraction and 0.06 μmol/ml/min for the crude extract. The chitinolytic activity was observed maximum at pH 5 and at temperature of 40°C. The genetically modified pure form can be used in the production of transgenic plants and in bringing out commercial formulation for the control of Lepidopteran pests.

D003160 D016428 D013485 D013486 	Characterization and disruption of a gene in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum encoding a cellulase lacking a cellulose binding domain and hinge region.	A gene, CEL1, in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum was identified using the cbh1-3 gene of Phanerochaete chrysosporium as a heterologous probe. The predicted product of CEL1, Cel1, is 62% identical and 71% similar to the product of cbh1-3 and 54 to 62% identical to five cellobiohydrolases from other filamentous fungi. The location of the polyadenylation site 221 bp downstream of the stop codon and the location of a single intron of 55 bp were identified by comparison of the sequences of genomic and cDNA copies of CEL1. The transcriptional start site was determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to be 39 bp upstream of the putative translational start site. CEL1 mRNA abundance is high when C. carbonum is grown on cellulose or maize cell walls but is undetectable when grown on 2% sucrose or cellulose plus sucrose. Cel1 has a predicted signal peptide of 18 amino acids and therefore a mature size of 46.4 kDa. Like the product of cbh1-1 of P. chrysosporium, but unlike most other endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases (including the predicted product of cbh1-3), Cel1 does not have a putative cellulose binding domain or associated hinge region. The codon bias of CEL1 is stronger than the bias of cbh1-1 and comparable to that of cbh1-3 and that of the C. carbonum genes PGN1 and XYL1, (encoding endopolygalacturonase and endo-xylanase, respectively). A strain of C. carbonum specifically mutated at CEL1 was produced by transformation with a truncated copy of CEL1. Integration and disruption of CEL1 in the mutant was confirmed by DNA and RNA blotting. Pathogenicity of the CEL1 mutant was indistinguishable from the wild-type, indicating that CEL1 by itself is not a critical disease determinant. Culture filtrates of C. carbonum grown on cellulose or maize cell walls had several cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, and beta-glucosidase activities that were separable by chromatofocusing, hydrophobic interaction, or ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 
19527524	20090617	BMC_Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Expression of endo-1, 4-beta-xylanase from Trichoderma reesei in Pichia pastoris and functional characterization of the produced enzyme.	In recent years, xylanases have attracted considerable research interest because of their potential in various industrial applications. The yeast Pichia pastoris can neither utilize nor degrade xylan, but it possesses many attributes that render it an attractive host for the expression and production of industrial enzymes. The Xyn2 gene, which encodes the main Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 endo-beta-1, 4-xylanase was cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The selected P. pastoris strains produced as 4,350 nkat/ml beta-xylanase under the control of the methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter. The secreted recombinant Xyn2 was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 21 kDa. The activity of the recombinant Xyn2 was highest at 60 degrees C and it was active over a broad range of pH (3.0-8.0) with maximal activity at pH 6.0. The enzyme was quite stable at 50 degrees C and retained more than 94% of its activity after 30 mins incubation at this temperature. Using Birchwood xylan, the determined apparent Km and kcat values were 2.1 mg/ml and 219.2 S-1, respectively. The enzyme was highly specific towards xylan and analysis of xylan hydrolysis products confirmed as expected that the enzyme functions as endo-xylanase with xylotriose as the main hydrolysis products. The produced xylanase was practically free of cellulolytic activity. The P. pastoris expression system allows a high level expression of xylanases. Xylanase was the main protein species in the culture supernatant, and the functional tests indicated that even the non-purified enzyme shows highly specific xylanase activity that is free of cellulolytic side acitivities. Therefore, P pastoris is a very useful expression system when the goal is highly specific and large scale production of glycosyl hydrolases.

Candida wickerhamii NRRL Y-2563 produced a cell-bound beta-glucosidase when grown in complex media containing 50 g of cellobiose per liter. The majority of the enzyme was located on the cell surface and was released into the supernatant upon treatment of intact cells with Zymolyase 60,000. Only about 10% of the total activity was associated with the cytoplasm. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme had an apparent native molecular mass of about 198,000 Da and appeared to be composed of two subunits with approximate molecular masses of 94,000 Da. The beta-glucosidase contained approximately 30.5% (w/w) carbohydrate. Mannose was the only detected neutral carbohydrate associated with the purified enzyme. The enzyme demonstrated optimal activity at a pH of 4.0 to 5.0. The Km of the purified beta-glucosidase was 6.74 X 10(-2) M for cellobiose and 4.17 X 10(-3) M for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside. Glucose did not appear to inhibit the enzyme.

D016428 	Role of two alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases in arabinoxylan degradation and characteristics of the encoding genes from shochu koji molds, Aspergillus kawachii and Aspergillus awamori.	Two different alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases from Aspergillus kawachii were purified and characterized. The two enzymes acted synergically with xylanase in the degradation of arabinoxylan and resulted in an increase in the amount of ferulic acid release by feruloyl esterase. Both enzymes were acidophilic and acid stable enzymes which had an optimum pH of 4.0 and were stable at pH 3.0-7.0. The general properties of the enzymes including pH optima and pH stability were similar to those of Aspergillus awamori. These results suggest that the alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases contribute to an increase in cereal utilization and formation of aroma in shochu brewing. Two different genes encoding alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases from A. kawachii, designated as AkabfA and AkabjB, and those from A. awamori, designated as AwabfA and AwabjB, were also cloned and characterized. The difference between the sequences of AkabfA and AwabfA was only one nucleotide, resulting in an amino acid difference in the sequence, and the enzymes were assigned to family 51 of glycoside hydrolases. On the other hand, the differences between the sequences of AkabjB and AwabjB and between their encoding proteins were two nucleotides and one amino acid residue, respectively, and the enzymes were assigned to family 54 of glycoside hydrolases. On comparison of the abfA and abjB genes among A. kawachii, A. awamori, and A. niger, the relationship between the two genes for A. kawachii and A. awamori was much closer than those between A. niger and the others. Northern analyses showed that transcription of AkabfB was greater than that of AkabfA in the presence of L-arabitol and L-arabinose, and that transcriptions of both genes were not induced in the presence of sucrose and glucose.

The β-mannanase gene, man5C1, was cloned from Penicillium pinophilum C1, a strain isolated from the acidic wastewater of a tin mine in Yunnan, China, and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The sequence analysis displayed the gene consists of a 1221-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 406 amino acids (Man5C1). The deduced amino acid sequence of Man5C1 showed the highest homology of 57.8% (identity) with a characterized β-mannanase from Aspergillus aculeatus belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5. The purified rMan5C1 had a high specific activity of 1035U mg(-1) towards locust bean gum (LBG) and showed highest activity at pH 4.0 and 70°C. rMan5C1 was adaptable to a wide range of acidity, retaining >60% of its maximum activity at pH 3.0-7.0. The enzyme was stable over a broad pH range (3.0 to 10.0) and exhibited good thermostability at 50°C. The K(m) and V(max) values were 5.6 and 4.8mgmL(-1), and 2785 and 1608μmolmin(-1)mg(-1), respectively, when LBG and konjac flour were used as substrates. The enzyme had strong resistance to most metal ions and proteases (pepsin and trypsin), and released 8.96mgg(-1) reducing sugars from LBG in the simulated gastric fluid. All these favorable properties make rMan5C1 a promising candidate for use in animal feed.

A novel extracellular exoinulinase was purified and characterized from a new yeast strain KRF1(T), and the gene encoding the enzyme was successfully cloned. The enzyme was stable at low pH between 3.0 and 6.5. The K (m) and V (max) values of the purified enzyme for inulin were 2.3 mg/mL and 4.8 mg/min, respectively. The optimum temperature of the inulinase was 50 °C, and the enzyme remained 78 % of activity at 60 °C for 2 h. The inulinase showed an amino acid sequence identity of 58 % to its closest homolog in Meyerozyma (Pichia) guilliermondii. In the secondary structure, the domain G (VMEVH) of the enzyme contained three unique residues (V, M, and H). Compared with previously reported inulinases, the enzyme from strain KRF1(T) displayed strong acid resistance, notable thermostability, and high affinity for the substrate of inulin. Based on sequence analysis of the 26S rDNA D1/D2 domain and phenotypic characterization, the yeast strain KRF1(T) was found to represent a novel anamorphic, ascomycetous yeast species. A complete description of the species is given and the name Candida kutaonensis sp. nov (type strain = KRF1(T) = AS 2.4027(T) = CBS 11388(T)) is proposed.

A novel endoglucanase from Trichoderma reesei, EGIII, has been purified and its catalytic properties have been studied. The gene for that enzyme (egl3) and cDNA have been cloned and sequenced. The deduced EGIII protein shows clear sequence homology to a Schizophyllum commune enzyme (M. Yaguchi, personal communication), but is very different from the three other T. reesei cellulases with known structure. Nevertheless, all the four T. reesei cellulases share two common, adjacent sequence domains, which apparently can be removed by proteolysis. These homologous sequences reside at the N termini of EGIII and the cellobiohydrolase CBHII, but at the C termini of EGI and CBHI. Comparison of the fungal cellulase structures has led to re-evaluation of hypotheses concerning the localization of the active sites. 
12455695	20021129	Eukaryotic_Cell	D016428 D013485 	Eng1p, an endo-1,3-beta-glucanase localized at the daughter side of the septum, is involved in cell separation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	ENG1 (YNR067c), a gene encoding a new endo-1,3-beta-glucanase, was cloned by screening a genomic library with a DNA probe obtained by PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides designed according to conserved regions found between yeast exo-1,3-beta-glucanases (Exglp, Exg2p, and Ssglp). Eng1p shows strong sequence similarity to the product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ACF2 gene, involved in actin assembly "in vitro," and to proteins present in other yeast and fungal species. It is also related to plant glucan-binding elicitor proteins, which trigger the onset of a defense response upon fungal infection. Eng1p and Acf2p/Eng2p are glucan-hydrolyzing proteins that specifically act on 1,3-beta linkages, with an endolytic mode of action. Eng1p is an extracellular, heavily glycosylated protein, while Acf2p/Eng2p is an intracellular protein with no carbohydrate linked by N-glycosidic bonds. ENG1 transcription fluctuates periodically during the cell cycle; maximal accumulation occurs during the M/G1 transition and is dependent on the transcription factor Ace2p. Interestingly, eng1 deletion mutants show defects in cell separation, and Eng1p localizes asymmetrically to the daughter side of the septum, suggesting that this protein is involved, together with chitinase, in the dissolution of the mother-daughter septum. 
19039584	20081129	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Heterologous expression and characterization of a beta-1,6-glucanase from Aspergillus fumigatus.	The cell wall of Candida albicans is composed of mannoproteins associated to glycan polymers. Most of these proteins are retained in this compartment through a phosphodiester linkage between a remnant of their glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and the beta-1,6-glucan polymer. A pure beta-1,6-glucanase is thus required in order to release them. In this paper, we report the expression/secretion by the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica of an Aspergillus fumigatus enzyme homologous to previously described beta-1,6-glucanases. The coding sequence was expressed under the control of a strong promoter and the recombinant enzyme was targeted to the secretory pathway using the signal sequence of a well-known major secretory protein in this host. Addition of a FLAG epitope at the C-terminus allowed its efficient purification from culture supernatant following batch adsorption. The purified enzyme was characterized as a beta-1,6-glucanase and was shown to be active on C. albicans cell walls allowing the release of a previously described cell wall protein.

Chitinases have been implicated in fungal cell wall remodeling and play a role in exogenous chitin degradation for nutrition and competition. Due to the diversity of these enzymes, assigning particular functions to each chitinase is still ongoing. The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae produces several chitinases, and here, we evaluate whether endochitinase CHI2 is involved in the pathogenicity of this fungus. We constructed strains either overexpressing or lacking the CHI2 chitinase. These constructs were validated by Southern, Northern and Western blot analysis, and chitinase production. To access the effects of CHI2 chitinase in virulence, the cotton stainer bug Dysdercus peruvianus was used as a host. CHI2 overexpression constructs showed higher efficiency in host killing suggesting that the production of this chitinase by a constitutive promoter reduces the time necessary to kill the insect. More significantly, the knock out constructs showed decreased virulence to the insects as compared to the wild type strain. The lack of this single CHI2 chitinase diminished fungal infection efficiency, but not any other detectable trait, showing that the M. anisopliae family 18, subgroup B endochitinase CHI2 plays a role in insect infection.

In addition, the csn cDNA was also fused to the inulinase (INU1A) signal sequence from Kluyveromyces marxianus. The fusion sequence was transferred into S. cerevisiae industrial strain N-27. The purified chitosanase had a specific activity of 2.5 U/mg. The enzyme showed the maximum activity at 50 degrees C, which was different from the first reported chitosanase that from F. solanif. sp. Phaseoli. TLC and HPLC results indicated that most of the hydrolysis products were chitooligosaccharides with a polymerization below 10, and no monomers were detected. Furthermore, chitosanase activity was detected in the culture medium of the recombinant S. cerevisiae cultures, and the volume activity reached 50.2 mU/mL. This result indicated that the recombinant protein was secretively expressed in S. cerevisiae. The chitosanase from F. solani 0114 is an endochitosanase. Because of its special characteristics, this enzyme is very useful in chitooligosaccharides production, and the construction of recombinant S. cerevisiae made a step towards the large-scale production of this enzyme. 
1814275	19910101	Arch._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Induction, purification and characterisation of arabinases produced by Aspergillus niger.	The induction of arabinases in Aspergillus niger N400 was studied on different simple and complex carbon sources. Sugar beet pulp was found to be an inducer of three arabinan degrading enzymes (alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase A, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase B and endoarabinase). These enzymes were purified from A. niger culture fluid after growth of the fungus in medium employing sugar beet pulp as the carbon source and were characterised both physico-chemically (Mw 83,000, 67,000, 43,000 Da and, pI 3.3, 3.5 and 3.0 for alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases A and B and endo-arabinase, respectively) and kinetically (Km on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside 0.68 and 0.52 mM for alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases A and B, resp.; Km on sugar beet arabinan 0.24 and 3.7 g/l for alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase B and endoarabinase, resp.). The amino acid compositions of the three enzymes were determined also. The enzymic properties were compared with those of arabinases purified from a commercial A. niger enzyme preparation. Differences were found though the kinetic data suggest considerable similarity between the enzymes from the different sources. Antibodies raised in mice against the three enzymes were found to be highly specific and no crossreactivity with other proteins present in culture filtrates was observed. A mixture of these antibodies has been used to analyze specific induction of these individual enzymes on simple and complex substrates by Western blotting. 
11319115	20010425	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	The cel4 gene of Agaricus bisporus encodes a beta-mannanase.	Mannases have industrial uses in food and pulp industries, and their regulation may influence development of the mushrooms of commercially important basidiomycetes. We expressed an Agaricus bisporus cel4 cDNA, which encodes a mannanase, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. CEL4 had no detectable activity on cellulose or xylan. This gene is the first isolated from this economically important fungus to encode a mannanase. P. pastoris secreted about three times more CEL4 than S. cerevisiae. The removal of the cellulose-binding domain of CEL4 lowered the secreted specific activity by P. pastoris by approximately 97%. The genomic sequence of cel4 was isolated by screening a cosmid library of A. bisporus C54-carb8. The open reading frame was interrupted by 12 introns. The level of extracellular CEL4 increases dramatically at the postharvest stage in compost extracts of A. bisporus fruiting cultures. In laboratory liquid cultures of A. bisporus, the activity of CEL4 detected in the culture filtrate reached a maximum after 21 days. The levels of CEL4 broadly mirrored the levels of enzyme activity. In the Solka floc-bound mycelium, CEL4 protein showed a maximum after 2 to 3 weeks of culture and then declined. Changes in CEL4 activity during fruiting-body development suggest that hemicellulose utilization plays an important role in sporophore formation. The availability of the cloned gene will further studies of compost decomposition and the extracellular enzymes that fungi deploy in this process. 
16593451	19840401	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 	Lignin-degrading enzyme from Phanerochaete chrysosporium: Purification, characterization, and catalytic properties of a unique H(2)O(2)-requiring oxygenase.	An extracellular lignin-degrading enzyme from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burdsall was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography. The 42,000-dalton ligninase contains one protoheme IX per molecule. It catalyzes, nonstereospecifically, several oxidations in the alkyl side chains of lignin-related compounds: C(alpha)-C(beta) cleavage in lignin-related compounds of the type aryl-C(alpha)HOH-C(beta)HR-C(gamma)H(2)OH (R = -aryl or -O-aryl), oxidation of benzyl alcohols to aldehydes or ketones, intradiol cleavage in phenylglycol structures, and hydroxylation of benzylic methylene groups. It also catalyzes oxidative coupling of phenols, perhaps explaining the long-recognized association between phenol oxidation and lignin degradation. All reactions require H(2)O(2). The C(alpha)-C(beta) cleavage and methylene hydroxylation reactions involve substrate oxygenation; the oxygen atom is from O(2) and not H(2)O(2). Thus the enzyme is an oxygenase, unique in its requirement for H(2)O(2). 
8987884	19961101	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of two low molecular mass alkaline xylanases from Fusarium oxysporum F3.	Two low molecular mass endo-1,4-beta-D-xylanases from Fusarium oxysporum were purified to homogeneity by gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. They exhibit molecular masses of 20.8 (xylanase I) and 23.5 (xylanase II) kDa, and isoelectric points of 9.5 and 8.45-8.70, respectively. Both xylanases display remarkable pH (9.0) stability. At 40 to 55 degrees C xylanase II is more thermostable than xylanase I but less active on xylan. In contrast to xylanase I, xylanase II is able to hydrolyze 1-O-4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-xylopyranoside (muxg). Neither of these enzymes hydrolyze xylotriose. They bind on crystalline cellulose but not on insoluble xylan. Analysis of reaction mixtures by high pressure liquid chromatography revealed that both enzymes cleave preferentially the internal glycosidic bonds of xylopentaose and oat spelts xylan. Thus the purified enzymes appeared to be true endo-beta-1,4-xylanases. The amino terminal sequences of xylanases I and II show to homology. Xylanase I shows high similarity with alkaline low molecular mass xylanases of family G/11. 
23332834	20130122	Fungal_Biol	D016428 D013485 	Effect of copper, nutrient nitrogen, and wood-supplement on the production of lignin-modifying enzymes by the white-rot fungus Phlebia radiata.	Production of the oxidoreductive lignin-modifying enzymes - lignin and manganese peroxidases (MnPs), and laccase - of the white-rot basidiomycete Phlebia radiata was investigated in semi-solid cultures supplemented with milled grey alder or Norway spruce and charcoal. Concentrations of nutrient nitrogen and Cu-supplement varied also in the cultures. According to extracellular activities, production of both lignin peroxidase (LiP) and MnP was significantly promoted with wood as carbon source, with milled alder (MA) and low nitrogen (LN) resulting with the maximal LiP activities (550 nkat l(-1)) and noticeable levels of MnP (3 μkat l(-1)). Activities of LiP and MnP were also elevated on high nitrogen (HN) complex medium when supplemented with spruce and charcoal. Maximal laccase activities (22 and 29 μkat l(-1)) were obtained in extra high nitrogen (eHN) containing defined and complex media supplemented with 1.5 mM Cu(2+). However, the nitrogen source, either peptone or ammonium nitrate and asparagine, caused no stimulation on laccase production without Cu-supplement. This is also the first report to demonstrate a new, on high Cu(2+) amended medium produced extracellular laccase of P. radiata with pI value of 4.9, thereby complementing our previous findings on gene expression, and cloning of a second laccase of this fungus. 
11386370	20010602	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D016428 D013485 	Endopolygalacturonase is essential for citrus black rot caused by Alternaria citri but not brown spot caused by Alternaria alternata.	Alternaria citri, the cause of Alternaria black rot, and Alternaria alternata rough lemon pathotype, the cause of Alternaria brown spot, are morphologically indistinguishable pathogens of citrus: one causes rot by macerating tissues and the other causes necrotic spots by producing a host-selective toxin. To evaluate the role of endopolygalacturonase (endoPG) in pathogenicity of these two Alternaria spp. pathogens, their genes for endoPG were mutated by gene targeting. The endoPGs produced by these fungi have similar biochemical properties, and the genes are highly similar (99.6% nucleotide identity). The phenotypes of the mutants, however, are completely different. An endoPG mutant of A. citri was significantly reduced in its ability to cause black rot symptoms on citrus as well as in the maceration of potato tissue and could not colonize citrus peel segments. In contrast, an endoPG mutant of A. alternata was unchanged in pathogenicity. The results indicate that a cell wall-degrading enzyme can play different roles in the pathogenicity of fungal pathogens. The role of a cell wall-degrading enzyme depends upon the type of disease but not the taxonomy of the fungus. 
16039872	20050726	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D003160 D016428 	In vitro activation, purification, and characterization of Escherichia coli expressed aryl-alcohol oxidase, a unique H2O2-producing enzyme.	Aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO), a flavoenzyme with unique spectral and catalytic properties that provides H2O2 for fungal degradation of lignin, has been successfully activated in vitro after Escherichia coli expression. The recombinant AAO (AAO*) protein was recovered from inclusion bodies of E. coli W3110 transformed with pFLAG1 containing the aao cDNA from Pleurotus eryngii. Optimization of in vitro refolding yielded 75% active enzyme after incubation of AAO* protein (10 microg/ml) for 80 h (at 16 degrees C and pH 9) in the presence of glycerol (35%), urea (0.6 M), glutathione (GSSG/GSH molar ratio of 2), and FAD (0.08 mM). For large-scale production, the refolding volume was 15-fold reduced and over 45 mg of pure active AAO* was obtained per liter of E. coli culture after a single anion-exchange chromatographic step. Correct FAD binding and enzyme conformation were verified by UV-visible spectroscopy and circular dichroism. Although the three enzymes oxidized the same aromatic and aliphatic polyunsaturated primary alcohols, some differences in physicochemical properties, including lower pH and thermal stability, were observed when the activated enzyme was compared with fungal AAO from P. eryngii (wild enzyme) and Emericella nidulans (recombinant enzyme), which are probably related to the absence of glycosylation in the E. coli expressed AAO. 
14987996	20040228	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 	Purification, characterization, cDNA cloning, and expression of a xyloglucan endoglucanase from Geotrichum sp. M128.	A novel xyloglucan-specific endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (XEG), xyloglucanase, with a molecular mass of 80 kDa and a pI of 4.8, was isolated from the fungus Geotrichum sp. M128. It was found to be an endoglucanase active toward xyloglucan and not active toward carboxymethylcellulose, Avicel, or barley 1,3-1,4-beta-glucan. Analysis of the precise substrate specificity using various xyloglucan oligosaccharide structures revealed that XEG has at least four subsites (-2 to +2) and specifically recognizes xylose branching at the +1 and +2 sites. The full-length cDNA encoding XEG was cloned and sequenced. It consists of a 2436-bp open reading frame encoding a 776-amino acid protein. From its deduced amino acid sequence, XEG can be classified as a family 74 glycosyl hydrolase. The cDNA encoding XEG was then expressed in Escherichia coli, and enzymatically active recombinant XEG was obtained. 
20591661	20100702	Bioresour._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	An alpha-galactosidase from an acidophilic Bispora sp. MEY-1 strain acts synergistically with beta-mannanase.	An alpha-galactosidase gene (AgalB) was cloned from the acidophilic fungus Bispora sp. MEY-1 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The deduced amino acid sequence showed highest identity (35%) to the alpha-galactosidase from Penicillium simplicissimum, belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 27. The purified recombinant alpha-galactosidase (r-AgalB) exhibited optimal activity at pH 3.5 and 55 degrees C, was stable at pH 2.2-8.0, and showed higher hydrolytic activity towards galactomannan polysaccharides (guar gum and locust bean gum) than toward small galacto-oligosaccharides (melibiose, raffinose and stachyose). A synergistic (3-fold) increase in guar gum hydrolysis was observed when beta-mannanase Man5A from Bispora sp. MEY-1 and r-AgalB were combined. Further, an increase in the reaction time from 5h to 12h or increase of the temperature from 37 degrees C to 55 degrees C enhanced guar gum degradation by the enzyme combination. These properties make r-AgalB a good candidate for extensive application in the pulp/paper, food, and feed industries. 
2707445	19890410	FEBS_Lett.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Trametes versicolor ligninase: isozyme sequence homology and substrate specificity.	The substrate specificity of three ligninase isozymes from the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor has been investigated using stereochemically defined synthetic dimeric models for lignin. The isozymes have been found to attack non-phenolic beta-O-4 as well as beta-1 lignin model compounds. This finding confirms the classification of the isozymes from T. versicolor as ligninases. The amino-terminal residues of the three isozymes from T. versicolor have been determined using Edman degradation. Minor differences found between the sequences suggest the existence of several structural genes for ligninase in T versicolor. Comparisons have been made with the sequences of three previously reported ligninases from Phanerocompaete chrysosporium, another lignin-degrading fungus. One of the sequences from P. chrysosporium is distinctly more similar to the T. versicolor isozymes than to the other two sequences from P. chrysosporium. 
2226842	19901029	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 	Molecular cloning, nucleotide sequence and expression of the gene encoding prepro-polygalacturonaseII of Aspergillus niger.	PolygalacturonaseII of Aspergillus niger was fragmented using CNBr and the NH2-terminal fragment and another fragment were partially sequenced. The polygalacturonaseII (pgaII) gene was then isolated by using an oligonucleotide mixture based on the internal amino acid sequence as a probe. The nucleotide sequence of the pgaII structural gene was determined. It was found that polygalacturonaseII is synthesized as a precursor having an NH2-terminal prepro-sequence of 27 amino acids. The cloned gene was used to construct polygalacturonaseII over-producing A. niger strains. PolygalacturonaseII was isolated from one such strain and was determined to be correctly processed and to be fully active. 
8781176	19960901	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and expression of the nag1 gene (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase-encoding gene) from Trichoderma harzianum P1.	A 72-kDa N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase was purified from the mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma harzianum P1; antibodies were raised against it, and aa-sequences were obtained. The antibody reacted with a single 72-kDa protein band in culture filtrates of T. harzianum grown on chitin, and was subsequently used to clone the corresponding nag1 gene from a lambdagt11 cDNA expression library. It was interrupted by two short introns and encoded a protein of 580 amino acids. The deduced protein sequence contained aa-sequence areas of high similarity to N-acetyl-glucosaminidases from other eukaryotes such as Candida albicans, and invertebrate and vertebrate animal tissues. The highest similarity was observed with the corresponding gene from the silkworm. The aa-sequence of a tryptic fragment of purified N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase from T. harzianum corresponded to a deduced aa sequence from a portion of the cloned gene, thus verifying that the protein is encoded by nag 1. Southern analysis showed that nag 1 is present as a single-copy gene in T. harzianum. Expression of nag1-mRNA was strongly induced upon growth on chitin, N-acetyl-glucosamine and the cell walls of Botrytis cinerea used as a carbon source. The appearance of the corresponding N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase protein, as determined by Western analysis, paralleled the pattern of nag 1 expression, thereby suggesting that its formation is regulated at the level of transcription. 
12071852	20020620	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	An intron-containing glycoside hydrolase family 9 cellulase gene encodes the dominant 90 kDa component of the cellulosome of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces sp. strain E2.	The cellulosome produced by Piromyces sp. strain E2 during growth on filter paper was purified by using an optimized cellulose-affinity method consisting of steps of EDTA washing of the cellulose-bound protein followed by elution with water. Three dominant proteins were identified in the cellulosome preparation, with molecular masses of 55, 80 and 90 kDa. Treatment of cellulose-bound cellulosome with a number of denaturing agents was also tested. Incubation with 0.5% (w/v) SDS or 8 M urea released most cellulosomal proteins, while leaving the greater fraction of the 80, 90 and 170 kDa components. To investigate the major 90 kDa cellulosome protein further, the corresponding gene, cel9A, was isolated, using immunoscreening and N-terminal sequencing. Inspection of the cel9A genomic organization revealed the presence of four introns, allowing the construction of a consensus for introns in anaerobic fungi. The 2800 bp cDNA clone contained an open reading frame of 2334 bp encoding a 757-residue extracellular protein. Cel9A includes a 445-residue glycoside hydrolase family 9 catalytic domain, and so is the first fungal representative of this large family. Both modelling of the catalytic domain as well as the activity measured with low level expression in Escherichia coli indicated that Cel9A is an endoglucanase. The catalytic domain is succeeded by a putative beta-sheet module of 160 amino acids with unknown function, followed by a threonine-rich linker and three fungal docking domains. Homology modelling of the Cel9A dockerins suggested that the cysteine residues present are all involved in disulphide bridges. The results presented here are used to discuss evolution of glycoside hydrolase family 9 enzymes. 
10713452	20000314	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and analysis of two cellulase cDNAs from Orpinomyces joyonii.	Two cellulase cDNAs, celB29 and celB2, were isolated from a cDNA library derived from mRNA extracted from the anaerobic fungus, Orpinomyces joyonii strain SG4. The nucleotide sequences of celB2 and celB29 and the primary structures of the proteins encoded by these cDNAs were determined. The larger celB29 cDNA was 1966bp long and encoded a 477 amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of 54kDa. Analysis of the 1451bp celB2 cDNA revealed an 1164bp open reading frame coding for a 44kDa protein consisting of 388 amino acids. Both deduced proteins had a high sequence similarity in central regions containing putative catalytic domains. Primary structure analysis revealed that CelB29 contained a Thr/Pro-rich sequence that separated the N-terminal catalytic domain from a C-terminal reiterated region of unknown function. Homology analysis showed that both enzymes belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 5 and were most closely related to endoglucanases from the anaerobic fungi Neocallimastic patriciarum, Neocallimastix frontalis and Orpinomyces sp. The classification of CelB29 and CelB2 as endoglucanases was supported by enzyme assays. The cloned enzymes had high activities towards barley beta-glucan, lichenan and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), but not Avicel, laminarin, pachyman, xylan and pullulan. In addition, CelB29 and CelB2 showed activity against p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside (pNP-G(2)) to p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellopentaoside (pNP-G(5)) but not p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNP-G(1)) with preferential activity against p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellotrioside (pNP-G(3)). Based on these results, we proposed that CelB29 and CelB2 are endoglucanases with broad substrate specificities for short- and long-chain beta-1,4-glucans. 
9756616	19981002	J._Biochem.	D016428 	Isolation of the gene and characterization of the enzymatic properties of a major exoglucanase of humicola grisea without a cellulose-binding domain.	An exoglucanase gene was cloned from a cellulolytic fungus, Humicola grisea. DNA sequencing of this gene, designated as exo1, revealed that it contained four introns in the coding region. The deduced amino acid sequence of EXO1 was 451 amino acids in length and showed 57.7% identity with that of H. grisea cellobiohydrolase 1 (CBH1), but lacked the typical domain structures of a cellulose-binding domain and a hinge region. Transcriptional analysis of the exo1 and cbh1 genes showed that the expression of these genes was induced by Avicel, and repressed in the presence of glucose. The exo1 gene was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, and the recombinant EXO1 protein was purified. EXO1 and CBH1 produced by A. oryzae showed relatively higher activity toward Avicel, but showed much lower activity toward carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside (PNPC), than H. grisea endoglucanase 1 (EGL1). The addition of a cellulose-binding domain and a hinge region to EXO1 caused decreases in its enzymatic activities as well as the deletion of the cellulose-binding domain from CBH1. EXO1 showed relatively weak or no synergistic activity toward Avicel with H. grisea endoglucanases, but showed a significant level of apparent synergism with H. grisea CBH1 and Trichoderma reesei EGLI. CBH1 showed a significant level of apparent endo-exo synergism with H. grisea and T. reesei endoglucanases. H. grisea has at least two different types of major exoglucanase components and shows strong cellulolytic activity through synergism with cellulase components including EXO1 and CBH1.

Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase (GA) has been genetically engineered with modified signal peptide (MSP), increased copy number of the gene, and coexpression of SEC4, a gene encoding a Rab protein associated with secretory vesicles, and its secretion level has been successfully raised up to 100-fold in Pichia pastoris. The MSP was designed to contain the signal peptide of mouse salivary alpha-amylase (S8L) fused to the pro-region of the signal peptide of Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-mating factor to replace the wild type signal peptide (WTSP) of GA. The P. pastoris transformant MSPGA-1 containing a single copy of MSPGA gene showed a 3.6-fold increase in GA secretion as compared to that of WTSPGA-1. Moreover, the P. pastoris transformant MSPGA-7 harboring seven copies of the MSPGA inserts was identified and showed 56-fold higher secreted GA than WTSPGA-1. In addition, we found that overexpression of SEC4 further doubled the secretion level of GA in each MSPGA/P. pastoris transformant. Taken together, the MSPGA-7-SEC4 clone showed as much as 100-fold secretion level of GA when compared to WTSPGA-1. In summary, we have demonstrated that combination of the aforementioned genetic manipulations resulted in high level secretion of R. oryzae GA in P. pastoris. 
16341861	20051213	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Purification, characterization, and gene cloning of 46 kDa chitinase (Chi46) from Trichoderma reesei PC-3-7 and its expression in Escherichia coli.	We purified a chitinase (named Chi46), with a molecular mass of 46 kDa estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, from the culture filtrate of Trichoderma reesei PC-3-7 grown on N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). The relative activity of this enzyme reduced when the degrees of acetylation (DA) of chitosan decreased. Furthermore, the enzyme was able to hydrolyze colloidal chitin and ethylene glycol chitin. The gene chi46 was cloned and sequenced. chi46 encodes a protein of 424 amino acid residues containing a 35-amino acid prepro-type secretion signal peptide. The molecular mass of mature Chi46 calculated from deduced amino acid sequence was 42,265 Da. The chi46 transcript was biphasic when the mycelia were grown on GlcNAc, suggesting that the multiple regulatory proteins are involved in the chi46 expression. The chi46 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli (ca. 0.23 mg/ml culture). To determine substrate cleavage fashion of Chi46 in more detail, we carried out high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and viscosimetric assay using recombinant Chi46 (rChi46). Chi46 was shown to release mainly (GlcNAc)(2) from colloidal chitin (insoluble chitin) as an exo-type manner and to act on chitosan 7B (DA ca. 30%) and N-acetylchitooligosaccharides (soluble chitins) in an endo-type one. 
16980715	20060919	J._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Identification of an extracellular acid trehalase and its gene involved in fungal pathogenesis of Metarizium anisopliae.	Trehalose is the main sugar in the haemolymph of insects and is a key nutrient source for an insect pathogenic fungus. Secretion of trehalose-hydrolysing enzymes may be a prerequisite for successful exploitation of this resource by the pathogen. An acid trehalase [EC 3.2.1.28] was purified to homogeneity from a culture of a locust-specific pathogen, Metarhizium anisopliae, and its properties were characterized. The gene (ATM1) of this acid trehalase was also isolated. The pure enzyme can efficiently hydrolyze haemolymph trehalose into glucose in vitro. The new acid trehalase appearing in the haemolymph of Locusta migratoria infected with M. anisopliae had the same pI and substrate specificity as the purified fungal acid trehalase, and the concentration of trehalose in the haemolymph decreased sharply after infection. RT-PCR also revealed the ATM1 gene's expression in the haemolymph of the infected insects. Our results indicated that the acid trehalase may serve as an "energy scavenger" and deplete blood trehalose during fungal pathogenesis. 
19088319	20081218	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a beta-fructofuranosidase from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous.	An extracellular beta-fructofuranosidase from the yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous was characterized biochemically, molecularly, and phylogenetically. This enzyme is a glycoprotein with an estimated molecular mass of 160 kDa, of which the N-linked carbohydrate accounts for 60% of the total mass. It displays optimum activity at pH 5.0 to 6.5, and its thermophilicity (with maximum activity at 65 to 70 degrees C) and thermostability (with a T(50) in the range 66 to 71 degrees C) is higher than that exhibited by most yeast invertases. The enzyme was able to hydrolyze fructosyl-beta-(2-->1)-linked carbohydrates such as sucrose, 1-kestose, or nystose, although its catalytic efficiency, defined by the k(cat)/K(m) ratio, indicates that it hydrolyzes sucrose approximately 4.2 times more efficiently than 1-kestose. Unlike other microbial beta-fructofuranosidases, the enzyme from X. dendrorhous produces neokestose as the main transglycosylation product, a potentially novel bifidogenic trisaccharide. Using a 41% (wt/vol) sucrose solution, the maximum fructooligosaccharide concentration reached was 65.9 g liter(-1). In addition, we isolated and sequenced the X. dendrorhous beta-fructofuranosidase gene (Xd-INV), showing that it encodes a putative mature polypeptide of 595 amino acids and that it shares significant identity with other fungal, yeast, and plant beta-fructofuranosidases, all members of family 32 of the glycosyl-hydrolases. We demonstrate that the Xd-INV could functionally complement the suc2 mutation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and, finally, a structural model of the new enzyme based on the homologous invertase from Arabidopsis thaliana has also been obtained.

Three endopolygalacturonases (endoPG Ia, Ib, and Ic) were isolated from the culture filtrate of Stereum purpureum, the causative fungus of apple silver-leaf disease. Their properties, including specific activities, optimum pHs, thermal stabilities, and kinetic parameters (K(m) and Vmax) were compared. Their properties were very similar to one another except for the substrate specificity and relative molecular mass. The sugar chains of endoPG Is were released by hydrazinolysis, and one major sugar chain common to endoPG Is was isolated. The pyridylamino sugar was characterized by a two-dimensional mapping method using HPLC, and identified as a high mannose type N-linked sugar chain, Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3)Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3) Man beta 1-4 GlcNAc beta 1-4 GlcNAc (designated as M5.1). Observation of the course of Western blot analysis for the proteins from the culture filtrate with endoPG I antibodies showed that the fungus secreted three endoPG Is into the culture broth during the growing period.

The nagA gene contained no intron and encoded a polypeptide of 603 amino acids with a putative 19-amino acid signal sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence was very similar to the sequence of Candida albicans Hex1 and Trichoderma harzianum Nag1. Yeast cells containing the nagA cDNA under the control of the GAL1 promoter expressed beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. The chromosomal nagA gene of A. nidulans was disrupted by replacement with the argB marker gene. The disruptant strains expressed low levels of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity and showed poor growth on a medium containing chitobiose as a carbon source. Aspergillus oryzae strain carrying the nagA gene under the control of the improved glaA promoter produced large amounts of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in a wheat bran solid culture. 
14524699	20031004	Biotechnol._Prog.	D003160 D023362 D016428 	Expression of a Phanerochaete chrysosporium manganese peroxidase gene in the yeast Pichia pastoris.	A gene encoding manganese peroxidase (mnp1) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium was cloned downstream of a constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Three different expression vectors were constructed: pZBMNP contains the native P. chrysosporium fungal secretion signal, palphaAMNP contains an alpha-factor secretion signal derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and pZBIMNP has no secretion signal and was used for intracellular expression. Both the native fungal secretion signal sequence and alpha-factor secretion signal sequence directed the secretion of active recombinant manganese peroxidase (rMnP) from P. pastoris transformants. The majority of the rMnP produced by P. pastoris exhibited a molecular mass (55-100 kDa) considerably larger than that of the wild-type manganese peroxidase (wtMnP, 46 kDa). Deletion of the native fungal secretion signal yielded a molecular mass of 39 kDa for intracellular rMnP in P. pastoris. Treatment of the secreted rMnP with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) resulted in a considerable decrease in the mass of rMnP, indicating N-linked hyperglycosylation. Partially purified rMnP showed kinetic characteristics similar to those of wtMnP. Both enzymes also had similar pH stability profiles. Addition of exogenous Mn(II), Ca(II), and Fe(III) conferred additional thermal stability to both enzymes. However, rMnP was slightly less thermostable than wtMnP, which demonstrated an extended half-life at 55 degrees C. 
9884411	19990113	Glycobiology	D016428 D013486 	A xyloglucan-specific endo-beta-1,4-glucanase from Aspergillus aculeatus: expression cloning in yeast, purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme.	A full-length c-DNA encoding a xyloglucan-specific endo -beta-1, 4-glucanase (XEG) has been isolated from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus by expression cloning in yeast. The colonies expressing functional XEG were identified on agar plates containing azurine-dyed cross-linked xyloglucan. The cDNA encoding XEG was isolated, sequenced, cloned into an Aspergillus expression vector, and transformed into Aspergillus oryzae for heterologous expression. The recombinant enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by anion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography. The recombinant XEG has a molecular mass of 23,600, an isoelectric point of 3.4, and is optimally stable at a pH of 3.4 and temperature below 30 degreesC. The enzyme hydrolyzes structurally diverse xyloglucans from various sources, but hydrolyzes no other cell wall component and can therefore be considered a xyloglucan-specific endo -beta-1, 4-glucanohydrolase. XEG hydrolyzes its substrates with retention of the anomeric configuration. The Kmof the recombinant enzyme is 3.6 mg/ml, and its specific activity is 260 micromol/min per mg protein. The enzyme was tested for its ability to solubilize xyloglucan oligosaccharides from plant cell walls. It was shown that treatment of plant cell walls with XEG yields only xyloglucan oligosaccharides, indicating that this enzyme can be a powerful tool in the structural elucidation of xyloglucans. 
15502357	20041027	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Cloning and expression of a novel Trichoderma viride laminarinase AI gene (lamAI).	The gene lamAI, which encodes a novel laminarinase AI of Trichoderma viride U-1, was cloned using RT-PCR in conjunction with the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. The open reading frame consisted of 2,277 bp encoding a protein of 759 amino acid residues, including a 32-residue signal prepropeptide. The protein showed 91% sequence similarity to the putative Trichoderma virens beta-1,3-glucanase BGN1, but no significant similarity to fungal beta-1,6-glucanases or beta-1,3-glucanases from other organisms. On 40 h incubation with a solo carbon source, northern analysis revealed that the gene was induced by 0.5% laminaran from Eisenia bicyclis but was not by the same concentration of glucose. The lamAI cDNA was functionally expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, resulting in a recombinant enzyme with as high activity against laminaran as native LAMAI. Based on these data, the probable existence of endo-beta-1,3:1,6-glucan hydrolases as a subclass of endo-beta-1,3-glucanases in some mycoparasitic fungi is suggested. 
7764306	19940101	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the cellobiohydrolase I gene from Trichoderma koningii G-39.	The cellobiohydrolase I gene, cbh1, has been cloned from an enhanced cellulase-producing strain, Trichoderma koningii G-39. Sequence comparisons show that T. koningii cbh1 is identical to that of T. reesei with the exception of 6 bp--two causing silent substitutions in the coding region, three differing in one of the introns, and one in 5'-noncoding region. Thus, it should encode an identical CBHI to that of T. reesei despite the differences in morphological characters of the two species. Analysis of approximately 1.4 kb of the 5' flanking region shows a number of surprisingly interesting putative regulatory features. There are no unusual features within about 600 bp upstream of the translation start ATG. However, prior to the 600-bp region, there are seven CAAT sequences, a number of direct and inverted repeats, and two C/T-rich regions. Also, there are five consensus 5'-(G/C)PyGGGG-3' sequences that have been identified to be carbon catabolite repressor binding sites of Aspergillus nidulans CREA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae MIG1 repressors. The structural organization around these consensus sequence regions is similar to those of A. nidulas alcR and alcA promoters. While the production of large amounts of CBHI by T. koningii upon induction apparently correlates with the large number of CAAT boxes in the 5' upstream untranslated region of cbh1, the presence of five CREA/MIG1 repressor-binding consensus sequences in the region suggests the wide-domain carbon catabolite repression regulatory system that controls the A. nidulans ethanol regulon, and yeast GAL genes transcription might also be operative and responsible for regulation of T. koningii cbh1 transcription.

D023362 D016428 D013485 	Heterologous expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PGU1 gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe yields an enzyme with more desirable properties for the food industry.	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PGU1 gene was successfully expressed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The optimum pH and temperature for the recombinant enzyme were 5 and 40 degrees C, respectively, these being around 0.5 U higher and 5 degrees C lower than those shown by the native enzyme. The K(m) value was about fourfold higher than that of the S. cerevisiae enzyme. The recombinant endopolygalacturonase was more efficient in reducing the viscosity of polygalacturonic acid and was also more stable at different pHs and temperatures than the native enzyme. 
9145516	19970401	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of a novel alpha-galactosidase from Mortierella vinacea.	A novel alpha-galactosidase, designated alpha-galactosidase II, was isolated from the culture filtrate of Mortierella vinacea. The molecular size of the purified enzyme estimated by gel filtration was 60 kDa, which agreed with that, 51-62 kDa, estimated by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme was thermolabile at neutral pH, but the addition of BSA to the enzyme solution at the concentration of 0.01% increased its stability considerably. The enzyme appears to be novel because it showed a distinct substrate specificity from other microbial alpha-galactosidases on galactomanno-oligosaccharides, prepared from galactomannan, that is, the enzyme liberated not only side-chain alpha-galactosyl residue from 6(3)-mono-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-beta-1,4-D-mannotetraose but also terminal alpha-galactosyl residue from 6(3)-mono-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-beta-1,4-D-mannotriose. In addition, the enzyme acted on galactomannans effectively. alpha-Galactosidase II cDNA was cloned and its nucleotides sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that the mature enzyme consisted of 376 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 41,334 Da. The derived amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed 31-49% sequence similarity with those of alpha-galactosidases from other origins. 
8837440	19961001	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning of genes encoding alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase and beta-xylosidase from Trichoderma reesei by expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	A cDNA expression library of Trichoderma reesei RutC-30 was constructed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two genes, abf1 and bxl1, were isolated by screening the yeast library for extracellular alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase activity with the substrate p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside. The genes abf1 and bxl1 encode 500 and 758 amino acids, respectively, including the signal sequences. The deduced amino acid sequence of ABFI displays high-level similarity to the alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase B of Aspergillus niger, and the two can form a new family of glycosyl hydrolases. The deduced amino acid sequence of BXLI shows similarities to the beta-glucosidases grouped in family 3. The yeast-produced enzymes were tested for enzymatic activities against different substrates. ABFI released L-arabinose from p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and arabinoxylans and showed some beta-xylosidase activity toward p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside. BXLI did not release L-arabinose from arabinoxylan. It showed alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, alpha-L-arabinopyranosidase, and beta-xylosidase activities against p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D- xylopyranoside, respectively, with the last activity being the highest. It was also able to hydrolyze xylobiose and slowly release xylose from polymeric xylan. ABFI and BXLI correspond to a previously purified alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase and a beta-xylosidase from T. reesei, respectively, as confirmed by partial amino acid sequencing of the Trichoderma-produced enzymes. Both enzymes produced in yeasts displayed hydrolytic properties similar to those of the corresponding enzymes purified from T. reesei. 
9140977	19970401	Mol._Microbiol.	D016428 	Molecular characterization of the Aspergillus nidulans treA gene encoding an acid trehalase required for growth on trehalose.	Aspergillus nidulans conidiospores contain high levels of the non-reducing disaccharide trehalose. We show that upon induction of conidiospore germination, the trehalose pool is rapidly degraded and a glycerol pool is transiently accumulated. A trehalase with an acidic pH optimum was purified from conidiospores. Characterization of the treA gene encoding this trehalase shows that it is homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar acid trehalase, the product of the ATH1 gene, and to two related proteins of unknown function identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. A. nidulans mutants that lack acid trehalase activity were constructed by gene replacement at the treA locus. Analysis of these mutants suggests that the treA gene product is localized in the conidiospore wall, is required for growth on trehalose as a carbon source, and is not involved in the mobilization of the intracellular pool of trehalose. Therefore, it is proposed that a cytoplasmic regulatory trehalase is controlling this latter process. 
1511691	19920815	Eur._J._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	The polygalacturonases of Aspergillus niger are encoded by a family of diverged genes.	Aspergillus niger produces several polygalacturonases that, with other enzymes, are involved in the degradation of pectin. One of the two previously characterized genes coding for the abundant polygalacturonases I and II (PGI and PGII) found in a commercial pectinase preparation was used as a probe to isolate five more genes by screening a genomic DNA library in phage lambda EMBL4 using conditions of moderate stringency. The products of these genes were detected in the culture medium of Aspergillus nidulans transformants on the basis of activity measurements and Western-blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody raised against PGI. These transformants were, with one exception, constructed using phage DNA. A. nidulans transformants secreted high amounts of PGI and PGII in comparison to the previously characterized A. niger transformants and a novel polygalacturonase (PGC) was produced at high levels by A. nidulans transformed with the subcloned pgaC gene. This gene was sequenced and the protein-coding region was found to be interrupted by three introns; the different intron/exon organization of the three sequenced A. niger polygalacturonase genes can be explained by the gain or loss of two single introns. The pgaC gene encodes a putative 383-amino-acid prepro-protein that is cleaved after a pair of basic amino acids and shows approximately 60% amino acid sequence similarity to the other polygalacturonases in the mature protein. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the A. niger polygalacturonases display characteristic amino acid insertions or deletions that are also observed in polygalacturonases of phytopathogenic fungi. In the upstream regions of the A. niger polygalacturonase genes, a sequence of ten conserved nucleotides comprising a CCAAT sequence was found, which is likely to represent a binding site for a regulatory protein as it shows a high similarity to the yeast CYC1 upstream activation site recognized by the HAP2/3/4 activation complex. 
16404950	20060113	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D016428 D013485 	The endo-beta-1,4-xylanase xyn11A is required for virulence in Botrytis cinerea.	Phytopathogenic fungi can degrade xylan, an abundant hemicellulose in plant cell walls, by the coordinate action of a group of extracellular enzymes. Among these, endo-beta-1,4-xylanases carry out the initial breakdown by cleaving internal bonds in the polymer backbone. We have isolated and characterized a gene, xyn11A, coding for an endo-beta-1,4-xylanase belonging to family 11 of glycosyl hydrolases. xyn11A was shown to be induced by xylan and repressed by glucose and to be expressed in planta. The disruption of xyn11A caused only a moderate decrease, about 30%, in the level of extracellular endo-beta-1-4-xylanase activity and in the growth rate, with beechwood xylan as the only carbon source. However, deletion of the gene had a more pronounced effect on virulence, delaying the appearance of secondary lesions and reducing the average lesion size by more than 70%. Reintroducing the wild-type gene into the mutant strains reversed this phenotype back to wild type.

Kluyveromyces marxianus NBRC1777 was identified as a thermotolerant yeast and was developed as a host for the expression of thermostable cellulase genes. The previously isolated genes for thermostable endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, cellobiohydrolase, and beta-glucosidase were introduced into the chromosome of K. marxianus and successfully expressed under the control of high-expression promoters. The recombinant K. marxianus expressing cellulase genes became able to grow in synthetic medium containing cellobiose or carboxymethyl-cellulose as the single carbon source. Moreover, the recombinant strain produced 43.4 g/L ethanol from 10% cellobiose. These results suggest that K. marxianus may afford a useful host system, which may be applicable to the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and the foundation of cellulose consolidated bioprocessing.

The xlnD gene encoding the 85-kDa beta-xylosidase was cloned from Aspergillus nidulans. The deduced primary structure of the protein exhibits considerable similarity to the primary structures of the Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidases and some similarity to the primary structures of the class 3 beta-glucosidases. xlnD is regulated at the transcriptional level; it is induced by xylan and D-xylose and is repressed by D-glucose. Glucose repression is mediated by the product of the creA gene. Although several binding sites for the pH regulatory protein PacC were found in the upstream regulatory region, it was not clear from a Northern analysis whether PacC is involved in transcriptional regulation of xlnD.

The white-rot fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora delignifies lignocellulose with high selectivity, but until now it has appeared to lack the specialized peroxidases, termed lignin peroxidases (LiPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs), that are generally thought important for ligninolysis. We screened the recently sequenced C. subvermispora genome for genes that encode peroxidases with a potential ligninolytic role. A total of 26 peroxidase genes was apparent after a structural-functional classification based on homology modeling and a search for diagnostic catalytic amino acid residues. In addition to revealing the presence of nine heme-thiolate peroxidase superfamily members and the unexpected absence of the dye-decolorizing peroxidase superfamily, the search showed that the C. subvermispora genome encodes 16 class II enzymes in the plant-fungal-bacterial peroxidase superfamily, where LiPs and VPs are classified. The 16 encoded enzymes include 13 putative manganese peroxidases and one generic peroxidase but most notably two peroxidases containing the catalytic tryptophan characteristic of LiPs and VPs. We expressed these two enzymes in Escherichia coli and determined their substrate specificities on typical LiP/VP substrates, including nonphenolic lignin model monomers and dimers, as well as synthetic lignin. The results show that the two newly discovered C. subvermispora peroxidases are functionally competent LiPs and also suggest that they are phylogenetically and catalytically intermediate between classical LiPs and VPs. These results offer new insight into selective lignin degradation by C. subvermispora.

For the development of an efficient gene expression system in a shoyu koji mold Aspergillus oryzae KBN616, the TEF1 gene, encoding translation-elongation factor 1 alpha, was cloned from the same strain and used for expression of polygalacturonase genes. The TEF1 gene comprised 1647 bp with three introns. The TEF1-alpha protein consisted of 460 amino acids possessing high identify to other fungal TEF proteins. Two nucleotide sequences homologous to the upstream activation sequence, characterized for the ribosomal protein genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as the pyrimidine-rich sequences were present in the TEF1 gene promoter region, suggesting that the A, oryzae TEF1 gene has a strong promoter activity. Two expression vectors, pTFGA300 and pTFGB200 for production of polygalacturonases A and B respectively, were constructed by using the TEF1 gene promoter. A polygalacturonase (PGB) gene cloned from the same strain comprised 1226 bp with two introns and encoded a protein of 367 amino acids with high similarity to other fungal polygalacturonases. PGA and PGB were secreted at approximately 100 mg/l in glucose medium and purified to homogeneity. PGA had a molecular mass of 41 kDa, a pH optimum of 5.0 and temperature optimum of 45 degrees C. PGB had a molecular mass of 39 kDa, a pH optimum of 5.0 and temperature optimum of 55 degrees C.

A new cellobiohydrolase (CBH) gene (cbh3) from Chaetomium thermophilum was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Pichia pastoris. Using RACE-PCR, a new thermostable CBH gene (cbh3) was cloned from C. thermophilum. The cDNA of the CBH was 1607 bp and contained a 1356 bp open reading frame encoding a protein CBH precursor of 451 amino acid residues. The mature protein structure of C. thermophilum CBH3 only comprises a catalytic domain and lacks cellulose-binding domain and a hinge region. The gene was expressed in P. pastoris. The recombinant CBH purified was a glycoprotein with a size of about 48.0 kDa, and exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 60 degrees C. The enzyme was more resistant to high temperature. The CBH could hydrolyse microcrystalline cellulose and filter paper. A new thermostable CBH gene of C. thermophilum was cloned, sequenced and overexpressed in P. pastoris. This CBH offers an interesting potential in saccharification steps in both cellulose enzymatic conversion and alcohol production. 
8000538	19941001	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485 	Arabinase gene expression in Aspergillus niger: indications for coordinated regulation.	Aspergillus niger secretes three glycosylated glycosyl hydrolases which are involved in degradation of the plant cell wall polysaccharide L-arabinan: alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases (ABF) A and B, and endo-1,5-alpha-L-arabinase (ABN) A. The nucleotide sequence of the previously cloned gene encoding ABF A (abfA) from A. niger was determined. The coding region contains seven introns. Mature ABF A comprises 603 amino acids with a molecular mass of 65.4 kDa as deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The secreted enzyme is N-glycosylated. The primary structures of the three A. niger arabinases characterized lack similarity. Regulation of arabinase expression upon induction by sugar beet pulp and by L-arabitol was studied as a function of time. This was done in wild-type A. niger as well as in transformants carrying multiple copies of either one of the ABF-encoding genes. Each arabinase gene responded differently upon a mycelial transfer to L-arabitol-containing medium. Extra copies of abfA or abfB led to a decreased expression level of ABN A, though the repression elicited by abfB is stronger and more persistent than that effected by abfA. Multiple copies of both abf genes influence expression of the other ABF similarly, but to a far less pronounced degree than they affect ABN A synthesis. Four putative promoter elements, shared by all three arabinase genes, could be involved in coordination of L-arabinan degradation by A. niger.

For the construction of an overexpression system of the intracellular 1,2-alpha-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.113) gene (msdS) from Aspergillus saitoi (now designated Aspergillus phoenicis), the N-terminal signal sequence of the gene was replaced with that of the aspergillopepsin I (EC 3.4.23.18) gene (apnS) signal, one of the same strains as described previously. Then the fused 1, 2-alpha-mannosidase gene (f-msdS) was inserted into the NotI site between P-No8142 and T-agdA in the plasmid pNAN 8142 (9.5 kbp) and thus the Aspergillus oryzae expression plasmid pNAN-AM1 (11.2 kbp) was constructed. The fused f-msdS gene has been overexpressed in a transformant A. oryzae niaD AM1 cell. The recombinant enzyme expressed in A. oryzae cells was purified to homogeneity in two steps. The system is capable of making as much as about 320 mg of the enzyme/litre of culture. The recombinant enzyme has activity with methyl-2-O-alpha-d-mannopyranosyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside at pH 5.0, while no activity was determined with methyl-3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside or methyl-6-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside. The substrate specificity of the enzyme was analysed by using pyridylaminated (PA)-oligomannose-type sugar chains, Man9-6(GlcNAc)2-PA (Man is mannose; GlcNAc is N-acetylglucosamine). The enzyme hydrolysed Man8GlcNAc2-PA (type 'M8A') fastest, and 'M6C' {Manalpha1-3[Manalpha1-2Manalpha1-3(Manalpha1-6) Manalpha1-6]Manbeta1- 4GlcNAcbeta1-4GlcNAc-PA} slowest, among the PA-sugar chains. Molecular-mass values of the enzyme were determined to be 63 kDa by SDS/PAGE and 65 kDa by gel filtration on Superose 12 respectively. The pI value of the enzyme was 4.6. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was GSTQSRADAIKAAFSHAWDGYLQY, and sequence analysis indicated that the signal peptide from apnS gene was removed. The molar absorption coefficient, epsilon, at 280 nm was determined as 91539 M-1.cm-1. Contents of the secondary structure (alpha-helix, beta-structure and the remainder of the enzyme) by far-UV CD determination were about 55, 38 and 7% respectively. The melting temperature, Tm, of the enzyme was 71 degrees C by differential scanning calorimetry. The calorimetric enthalpy, DeltaHcal, of the enzyme was calculated as 13.3 kJ.kg of protein-1. Determination of 1 g-atom of Ca2+/mol of enzyme was performed by atomic-absorption spectrophotometry.

Rhamnogalacturonase was purified from culture filtrate of Aspergillus aculeatus after growth in medium with sugar-beet pulp as carbon source. Purified protein was used to raise antibodies in mice and with the antiserum obtained a gene coding for rhamnogalacturonase (rhgA) was isolated from a lambda cDNA expression library. The cloned rhgA gene has an open-reading frame of 1320 base pairs encoding a protein of 440 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 45 962 Da. The protein contains a potential signal peptidase cleavage site behind Gly-18 and three potential sites for N-glycosylation. Limited homology with A. niger polygalacturonase amino acid sequences is found. A genomic clone of rhgA was isolated from a recombinant phage lambda genomic library. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed that the coding region of the gene is interrupted by three introns. Furthermore, amino acid sequences of four different peptides, derived from purified A. aculeatus rhamnogalacturonase, were also found in the deduced amino acid sequence of rhgA. A. aculeatus strains overexpressing rhamnogalacturonase were obtained by cotransformation using either the A. niger pyrA gene or the A. aculeatus pyrA gene as selection marker. For expression of rhamnogalacturonase in A. awamori the A. awamori pyrA gene was used as selection marker. Degradation patterns of modified hairy regions, determined by HPLC, show the recombinant rhamnogalacturonase to be active, and the enzyme was found to have a positive effect in the apple hot-mash liquefaction process.

Penicillium herquei IFO 4674 is a filamentous fungus that produces a large amount of hydrolases for fibrous polysaccharides. We purified two beta-xylosidases, S1 and S2. The molecular masses of S1 and S2 determined by MALDI-TOF-MS were 103,700 and 37,460 Da. The optimum pHs of S1 and S2 were 4.0 and 6.5, respectively. By several kinds of alcohols, especially glycerol, S1 was activated while S2 was unaffected or inhibited. S1 had a transxylosylation activity, while S2 did not. The s2 gene encoding xylosidase S2 was cloned by PCR with primers designed on the basis of partial amino acid sequences of S2. The s2 consisted of 1005 by encoding 335 amino acids (37,433 Da) and had no secretion signal sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence shows a high identity to that of Bacteroides ovatus xylosidase/arabinosidase (56%), which is a member of the family 43 glycoside hydrolase.

Its activity was increased by Mn(2+), completely inhibited by Cu(2+), and strongly inhibited by Al(3+), Ag(+), Fe(3+), Fe(2+), Ni(2+), Zn(2+), and Mg(2+). The product of hydrolysis of inulin by the recombinant exoinulinase was fructose. 
3240864	19881015	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Molecular analysis of a Phanerochaete chrysosporium lignin peroxidase gene.	The basidiomycete fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium produces a number of extracellular peroxidases which appear to be important for lignin degradation. We present here the isolation and complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of a gene (lpo) coding for lignin peroxidase (LPO), the coding region of which is identical to a lpo cDNA sequence which had previously been described [M. Tien and C.-P.D. Tu, Nature 326 (1987) 520-523]. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence corresponds to 372 aa residues and the coding region is interrupted by eight short introns that range in size from 50 to 62 nt. Southern blot experiments using the cloned lpo gene as hybridization probe revealed a complex restriction fragment pattern, indicating that there are a number of lpo-related nucleotide sequences present in P. chrysosporium DNA which cross-hybridize. We also present data on the in vivo expression of the lpo genes and show that they are regulated at the RNA level and that the structure of the transcripts as judged from S1 experiments is complex. These data are consistent with the idea that there are a number of related lpo genes in P. chrysosporium which constitute a gene family. 
8987553	19960801	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Acid xylanase from yeast Cryptococcus sp. S-2: purification, characterization, cloning, and sequencing.	A xylan-degrading enzyme produced by yeast Cryptococcus sp. S-2 was isolated and purified, and characterized as an endoxylanase (1,4-beta-D-xylan xylanohydrolase [EC 3.2.1.8]). We estimated the molecular weight and isoelectric point of purified xylanase (xyn-CS2) to be 22,000 and 7.4, respectively. This low-molecular-weight xylanase had an unusual pH optimum of 2.0, and showed 75% of maximal activity even at pH 1.0. An open reading frame of the cDNA specified 209 amino acids, including a putative signal peptide of 25 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of xyn-CS2 shared significant similarities with the family-G xylanases of B. pumilus, C. acetobutylicum, T. reesei, and A. kawachii. Xyn-CS2 included two unique cysteine residues in a putative catalytic region, raising the possibility that these residues are at least partially responsible for its acidophilic nature. 
8595661	19951201	Curr._Genet.	D003160 D016428 	Two family G xylanase genes from Chaetomium gracile and their expression in Aspergillus nidulans.	With oligonucleotides based on the amino-terminal and internal amino-acid sequences of a xylanase, two xylanase genes, cgxA and cgxB, were isolated and sequenced from Chaetomium gracile wild and mutant strains. Each gene isolated from both strains was essentially the same as far as nucleotide sequences were compared. The mature CgXA and CgXB xylanases comprise 189 and 211 amino acids, respectively, and share 68.5% homology. The CgXA was found to be the major enzyme in the mutant strain. Comparison of these amino-acid sequences with xylanase sequences from other origins showed that they have a high degree of identity to the family G xylanases. The cgxA and cgxB genes were introduced into Aspergillus nidulans and found to be expressed with their own promoters.

The mature peptide of Metarhizium anisopliae acid trehalase (ATM1) (EC3.2.1.28) was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris at high levels under the control of AOX1 promoter. The recombinant ATM1 (reATM1) was secreted into culture medium. After 48-h 0.5% methanol induction, the activity of reATM1 in the culture supernatant reached the peak, 5.35 U/mg. Enzyme with a histidine sequence appended to the C terminus was still active and was purified using metal-chelate affinity chromatography. The yield of purified reATM1 was 2.5 mg from 1L supernatant. The purified reATM1 exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 170 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The optimum temperature and pH of reATM1 were 30 degrees C and 6.0, respectively, and the K(m) and V(max) values for reATM1 were 2.6 mM and 0.305 mmol/min/mg, respectively. Studies showed that the enzymatic properties of reATM1 were similar to those of the native ATM1. 
22101785	20111122	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Cloning and expression in Pichia pastoris of an Irpex lacteus rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase tolerant to acetylated rhamnogalacturonan.	In order to produce a recombinant rhamnogalacturonase from the basidiomycete Irpex lacteus using a molecular approach, PCR primers were designed based on a sequence alignment of four known ascomycete rhamnogalacturonases. Using 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments, a 1,437-bp full-length cDNA containing an open reading frame of 1,329 bp was isolated. The corresponding putative protein sequence is of 443 amino acids and contains a secretion signal sequence of 22 amino acids. The theoretical mass of this protein is 44.6 kDa with a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.2. The amino acid sequence shared not only significant identities with ascomycete and basidiomycete putative rhamnogalacturonases but also complete similarity with peptides obtained from a recently purified rhamnogalacturonase from I. lacteus. The recombinant protein was successfully expressed in active form in Pichia pastoris. SDS-PAGE assay demonstrated that the recombinant enzyme was secreted in the culture medium and had a molar mass of 56 kDa. This recombinant rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase exhibited a pH optimum between 4.5 and 5 and a temperature optimum between 40°C and 50°C, which correspond to that of the native rhamnogalacturonase from I. lacteus. The study of its specificity through reaction products analysis showed that it was highly tolerant to the presence of acetyl groups on its substrate, even more than the native enzyme. 
12723619	20030502	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Cloning and overexpression of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase encoding gene nagA from Aspergillus oryzae and enzyme-catalyzed synthesis of human milk oligosaccharide.	We isolated a beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase encoding gene from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae, and designated it nagA. The nagA gene encoded a polypeptide of 600 amino acids with significant similarity to glucosaminidases and hexosaminidases of various eukaryotes. A. oryzae strain carrying the nagA gene under the control of the improved glaA promoter produced large amounts of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in a wheat bran solid culture. The beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase was purified from crude extracts of the solid culture by column chromatographies on Q-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200. This enzyme was used for synthesis of lacto-N-triose II, which is contained in human milk. By reverse hydrolysis reaction, lacto-N-triose II and its positional isomer were synthesized from lactose and D-N-acetylglucosamine in 0.21% and 0.15% yield, respectively. 
12167544	20020809	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of PG2, an early endoPG produced by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, expressed in yeast.	Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a plant pathogenic ascomycete, contains a neutral endopolygalacturonase (endoPG) subfamily of genes that was previously isolated. We report here that pg2, a member of this subfamily, is early and strongly expressed during the first steps of pathogenesis of sunflower cotyledons. The corresponding protein, PG2, was produced in the heterologous Kluyveromyces lactis system and purified. Characterization of the recombinant enzyme revealed a narrow pH activity curve with an optimal pH of 4.5. Hydrolysis of polygalacturonic acid by PG2 resulted in the accumulation of oligomers ranging from 2- to 9-mer. This degradation profile indicates a random attack on the polymer and demonstrates an endo-mode of action. These results provide evidence that pg2 contributes to the infection process during the early phase of host colonization. 
15784980	20050324	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of a novel alpha-glucuronidase from Aspergillus niger specific for O-alpha-D-glucosyluronic acid alpha-D-glucosiduronic acid.	A new alpha-glucuronidase that specifically hydrolyzed O-alpha-D-glucosyluronic acid alpha-D-glucosiduronic acid (trehalose dicarboxylate, TreDC) was purified from a commercial enzyme preparation from Aspergillus niger, and its properties were examined. The enzyme did not degrade O-alpha-D-glucosyluronic acid alpha-D-glucoside, O-alpha-D-glucosyluronic acid beta-D-glucosiduronic acid, O-alpha-D-glucosyluronic acid-(1-->2)-beta-D-fructosiduronic acid, p-nitrophenyl-O-alpha-D-glucosiduronic acid, methyl-O-alpha-D-glucosiduronic acid, or 6-O-alpha-(4-O-alpha-D-glucosyluronic acid)-D-glucosyl-beta-cyclodextrine. Furthermore, it showed no activity on alpha-glucuronyl linkages of 4-O-methyl-D-glucosyluronic acid-alpha-(1-->2)-xylooligosaccharides, derived from xylan, a supposed substrate of alpha-glucuronidases.The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 120 kDa by gel filtration and 58 kDa by SDS-PAGE suggesting, the enzyme is composed of two identical subunits. It was most active at pH 3.0-3.5 and at 40 degrees C. It was stable in pH 2.0-4.5 and below 30 degrees C. It hydrolyzed O-alpha-D-glucosyluronic acid alpha-D-glucosiduronic acid to produce alpha- and beta-anomers of D-glucuronic acid in an equimolar ratio. This result suggests that inversion of the anomeric configuration of the substrate is involved in the hydrolysis mechanism. 
8503847	19930515	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	Production, purification and characterization of the catalytic domain of glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger.	The catalytic domain of glucoamylases G1 and G2 from Aspergillus niger is produced in vitro in high yield by limited proteolysis using either subtilisin Novo or subtilisin Carlsberg. Purification by affinity chromatography on an acarbose-Sepharose column followed by ion-exchange chromatography on HiLoad Q-Sepharose leads to separation of a number of structurally closely related forms of domain. The cleavage occurs primarily between Val-470 and Ala-471 as indicated by C-terminal sequencing, whereas the N-terminus is intact. Subtilisin Carlsberg, in addition, produces a type of domain which is hydrolysed before Ser-444, an O-glycosylated residue. This leaves the fragment Ser-444-Val-470 disulphide-bonded to the large N-terminal part of the catalytic domain. Subtilisin Novo, in contrast, tends to yield a minor fraction of forms extending approx. 30-40 amino-acid residues beyond Val-470. The thermostability is essentially the same for the single-chain catalytic domain and the original glucoamylases G1 and G2, whereas the catalytic domain cut between Ser-443 and Ser-444 is less thermostable. For both types of domain the kinetic parameters, Km and kcat., for hydrolysis of maltose are very close to the values found for glucoamylases G1 and G2. 
9802217	19981105	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Purification and properties of the raw-starch-digesting glucoamylases from Corticium rolfsii.	Corticium rolfsii AHU 9627, isolated from a tomato stem, is one of the strongest producers of raw-starch-digesting amylase. The amylase system secreted by C. rolfsii AHU 9627 consisted of five forms of glucoamylase (G1-G5) and a small amount of alpha-amylase. Among these amylases, G1, G2 and G3 were able to hydrolyze raw starch. Five forms of glucoamylase were separated from each other and purified to an electrophoretically homogeneous state. The molecular masses were: G1 78 kDa, G2 78 kDa, G3 79 kDa, G4 70 kDa, and G5 69 kDa. The isoelectric points were: G1 3.85, G2 3.90, G3 3.85, G4 4.0, and G5 4.1. These glucoamylases showed nearly identical characteristics except that G4 and G5 were unable to hydrolyze raw starch. 
9732526	19980911	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	A chitinase encoding gene (chit1 gene) from the entomopathogen Metarhizium anisopliae: isolation and characterization of genomic and full-length cDNA.	There are no reports to date of entire gene sequences coding for chitinolytic enzymes from entomopathogenic fungi, even though these enzymes act synergistically with proteolytic enzymes to solubilize insect cuticle during the key step of host penetration, having considerable importance in the biological control of some insect pests. This paper reports the complete nucleotide sequence and analysis of the chromosomal and full-length cDNA copies of the regulated gene (chit1) coding one of the chitinases produced by the biocontrol agent Metarhizium anisopliae. Degenerated primers, encompassing conserved regions of other fungal chitinases, were used to amplify a 650-bp DNA fragment, which was used to isolate genomic and cDNA clones from M. anisopliae. Albeit at least two different chitinases are characterized in this fungus, only one chit gene was isolated. The chit1 gene is interrupted by three short typical fungal introns and has a 1,521-bp ORF, which encodes a protein of 423 amino acids with a stretch of 35 amino acid residues displaying characteristics of signal peptide. The deduced sequence of the mature protein predicts a 42-kDa protein with pI of 5.8. Southern analysis of genomic DNA indicates a single copy of chit1 in the M. anisopliae genome. 
16232432	20051020	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Isolation and transcriptional analysis of a cellulase gene (cell) from the basidiomycete Irpex lacteus.	A gene (named cell) homologous to the cellobiohydrolase I gene (cbhl) of Trichoderma reesei was isolated and sequenced from the white rot basidiomycete Irpex lacteus MC-2. The cell open reading frame consists of 1551 bp, which is interrupted by two introns, encoding a polypeptide of 517 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 54,522 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that CEL1 (the protein encoded by cell) has a modular structure consisting of a catalytic domain of 449 amino acids and a C-terminal cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of 36 amino acids separated by a proline-, serine-, threonine-rich linker region of 32 amino acids. The CEL1 catalytic domain is homologous with fungal cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) belonging to family 7 of the glycosyl hydrolases. The transcription of cell was induced in the presence of various cellulosic substrates and repressed by glucose. It was therefore concluded that the reported sequence represents the first cellulase gene isolated from the basidiomycete Irpex.

Using RT-PCR and rapid amplication of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques, a 1345bp full-length cDNA fragment was obtained from Aspergillus sulphureus. The gene, designated MANN, codes for a 383-residue with a calculated mass of 41,389Da. MANN displayed amino acid sequence similarity to the beta-mannanase of Aspergillus aculeatus and Trichoderma reesei, members of the glycoside hydrolase family 5. The recombinant beta-mannanase gene was successfully expressed in a fully active form in Pichia pastoris. Southern blot analysis showed that the recombinant beta-mannanase gene had successfully integrated into the P. pastoris X-33 genome. SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays demonstrated that the recombinant beta-mannanase, a 48kDa glycosylated protein, was secreted into the culture medium. The enzyme had high specific activity toward locust bean gum and an extremely broad pH range of 2.2-8.0. It showed highest activity at pH 2.4 and 50 degrees C and was stable at temperature below 40 degrees C. The K(m) and V(max) values for locust bean gum at 50 degrees C and pH 2.4 are 0.93mgmL(-1) and 344.83Umg(-1), respectively. The isoelectric point of the recombinant protein is 4.89. The enzymatic activity of recombinant A. sulphureus beta-mannanase was not significantly affected by a range of ions or EDTA.

Two new beta-glucanase-encoding genes, EXG2 and MLG2, were isolated from the plant-pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum using polymerase chain reaction based on amino acid sequences from the purified proteins. EXG2 encodes a 46.6-kDa exo-beta1,3-glucanase and is located on the same 3.5-Mb chromosome that contains the genes of HC-toxin biosynthesis. MLG2 encodes a 26.8-kDa mixed-linked (beta1,3-beta1,4) glucanase with low activity against beta1,4-glucan and no activity against beta1,3-glucan. Specific mutants of EXG2 and MLG2 were constructed by targeted gene replacement. Strains with multiple mutations (genotypes exg1/mlg1, exg2/mlg1, mlg1/mlg2, and exg1/exg2/mlg1/mlg2) were also constructed by sequential disruption and by crossing. Total mixed-linked glucanase activity in culture filtrates of mlg1/mlg2 and exg1/exg2/mlg1/mlg2 mutants was reduced by approximately 73%. Total beta1,3-glucanase activity was reduced by 10, 54, and 96% in exg2, mlg1, and exg1/exg2/mlg1/mlg2 mutants, respectively. The quadruple mutant showed only a modest decrease in growth on beta1,3-glucan or mixed-linked glucan. None of the mutants showed any decrease in virulence.

D003160 D016428 D013486 D013487 	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPR1 gene encodes a sporulation-specific exo-1,3-beta-glucanase which contributes to ascospore thermoresistance.	A number of genes have been shown to be transcribed specifically during sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yet their developmental function is unknown. The SPR1 gene is transcribed during only the late stages of sporulation. We have sequenced the SPR1 gene and found that it has extensive DNA and protein sequence homology to the S. cerevisiae EXG1 gene which encodes an exo-1,3-beta-glucanase expressed during vegetative growth (C. R. Vasquez de Aldana, J. Correa, P. San Segundo, A. Bueno, A. R. Nebrada, E. Mendez, and F. del Ray, Gene 97:173-182, 1991). We show that spr1 mutant cells do not hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside or laminarin in a whole-cell assay for exo-1,3-beta-glucanases. In addition to the absence of this enzymatic activity, spr1 mutant spores exhibit reduced thermoresistance relative to isogenic wild-type spores. These observations are consistent with the notion that SPR1 encodes a sporulation-specific exo-1,3-beta-glucanase.

One way of improving heterologous protein production is to use high cell density systems, one of the most attractive being the flocculating yeast production system. Also, lactose is available in large amounts as a waste product from cheese production processes. The construction of flocculent and non-flocculent brewer's yeast strains secreting beta-galactosidase and growing on lactose is presented. A plasmid was constructed coding for an extracellular beta-galactosidase of Aspergillus niger and having, as selective marker, the yeast CUP1 gene conferring resistance to copper. This selective marker allows for the transformation of wild-type yeasts. This work represents an important step towards the study of heterologous protein secretion by flocculent cells. 
12406766	20021031	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 	Engineering of polyploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae for secretion of large amounts of fungal glucoamylase.	We engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that produce large amounts of fungal glucoamylase (GAI) from Aspergillus awamori var. kawachi. To do this, we used the delta-sequence-mediated integration vector system and the heat-induced endomitotic diploidization method. delta-Sequence-mediated integration is known to occur mainly in a particular chromosome, and the copy number of the integration is variable. In order to construct transformants carrying the GAI gene on several chromosomes, haploid cells carrying the GAI gene on different chromosomes were crossed with each other. The cells were then allowed to form spores, which was followed by dissection. Haploid cells containing GAI genes on multiple chromosomes were obtained in this way. One such haploid cell contained the GAI gene on five chromosomes and exhibited the highest GAI activity (5.93 U/ml), which was about sixfold higher than the activity of a cell containing one gene on a single chromosome. Furthermore, we performed heat-induced endomitotic diploidization for haploid transformants to obtain polyploid mater cells carrying multiple GAI genes. The copy number of the GAI gene increased in proportion to the ploidy level, and larger amounts of GAI were secreted. 
18020405	20071121	J._Proteome_Res.	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486 	A proteomics strategy to discover beta-glucosidases from Aspergillus fumigatus with two-dimensional page in-gel activity assay and tandem mass spectrometry.	Economically competitive production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation is currently limited, in part, by the relatively high cost and low efficiency of the enzymes required to hydrolyze cellulose to fermentable sugars. Discovery of novel cellulases with greater activity could be a critical step in overcoming this cost barrier. beta-Glucosidase catalyzes the final step in conversion of glucose polymers to glucose. Despite the importance, only a few beta-glucosidases are commercially available, and more efficient ones are clearly needed. We developed a proteomics strategy aiming to discover beta-glucosidases present in the secreted proteome of the cellulose-degrading fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. With the use of partial or complete protein denaturing conditions, the secretory proteome was fractionated in a 2DGE format and beta-glucosidase activity was detected in the gel after infusion with a substrate analogue that fluoresces upon hydrolysis. Fluorescing spots were subjected to tryptic-digestion, and identification as beta-glucosidases was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. Two novel beta-glucosidases of A. fumigatus were identified by this in situ activity staining method, and the gene coding for a novel beta-glucosidase ( EAL88289 ) was cloned and heterologously expressed. The expressed beta-glucosidase showed far superior heat stability to the previously characterized beta-glucosidases of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae. Improved heat stability is important for development of the next generation of saccharifying enzymes capable of performing fast cellulose hydrolysis reactions at elevated temperatures, thereby lowering the cost of bioethanol production. The in situ activity staining approach described here would be a useful tool for cataloguing and assessing the efficiency of beta-glucosidases in a high throughput fashion. 
8299175	19931201	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of the abfB gene coding for the major alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase (ABF B) of Aspergillus niger.	Based on amino-acid sequence data from Aspergillus niger alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase B (ABF B), and cyanogen bromide fragments derived thereof, deoxyoligonucleotide mixtures were designed to be employed as primers in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on A. niger genomic DNA. This resulted in amplification of three related PCR products. The abfB gene encoding ABF B was isolated from a genomic library using such an amplification product as a probe. A 5.1-kb BamHI fragment was subcloned to result in plasmid pIM991. Upon introduction by co-transformation into both A. niger and A. nidulans uridine auxotrophic strains, pIM991 was shown to contain the functional gene since prototrophic transformants overproduced ABF B upon growth on the inducing carbon source sugar beet pulp. A plate assay was developed enabling quick selection of ABF B-overproducing transformants. The sequence of a 4122-bp long BamHI/SstI fragment was determined. The abfB gene does not contain introns and codes for a protein of 499 amino acids. The mature ABF B, 481 amino acids in length, has a deduced molecular weight of 50.7 kDa. A. niger abfB is the first eukaryotic gene encoding an ABF to be characterized.

The cDNA coding for Penicillium purpurogenum alpha-galactosidase (alphaGal) was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the alpha-Gal cDNA showed that the mature enzyme consisted of 419 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 46,334 Da. The derived amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed similarity to eukaryotic alphaGals from plants, animals, yeasts, and filamentous fungi. The highest similarity observed (57% identity) was to Trichoderma reesei AGLI. The cDNA was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the yeast GAL10 promoter. Almost all of the enzyme produced was secreted into the culture medium, and the expression level reached was approximately 0.2 g/liter. The recombinant enzyme purified to homogeneity was highly glycosylated, showed slightly higher specific activity, and exhibited properties almost identical to those of the native enzyme from P. purpurogenum in terms of the N-terminal amino acid sequence, thermoactivity, pH profile, and mode of action on galacto-oligosaccharides.

A full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) of Auxyn11D, a gene that encodes a novel endo-β-1,4-D-xylanase of Aspergillus usamii E001 (abbreviated to AuXyn11D), was obtained using 3'- and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. The cDNA sequence is 855 bp in length, containing 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions and a 696-bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 32-aa signal peptide and a 199-aa mature peptide (namely AuXyn11D). Multiple homology alignment of amino acid sequences verified that AuXyn11D belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 11. Moreover, a mature peptide-encoding cDNA fragment of Auxyn11D was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. One P. pastoris transformant expressing the highest recombinant AuXyn11D (reAuXyn11D) activity of 15.0 U/mL, labeled as P. pastoris GSAuXyn4-16, was chosen by shake flask test. SDS-PAGE assay demonstrated that the reAuXyn11D, a glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 32.0 kDa, was secreted into the medium. The purified reAuXyn11D displayed the highest activity at pH 4.5 and 55 °C. It was stable at a pH range of 3.5-6.5 and at a temperature of 50 °C or below. Its activity was not significantly affected by most of metal ions tested and EDTA, but increased by Ca(2+) and inhibited by Mn(2+). The K(m) and V(max) of the reAuXyn11D towards birchwood xylan were 6.32 mg/mL and 391.6 U/mg, respectively.

The glucoamylase from the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus has a molecular weight of 66 kDa and was characterized with isoelectric point, pH and temperature optimum of 3.8-4.0, 5.0 and 70 degrees C, respectively. In addition, the activation energy is 60.4 kJ/mol, Km is 3.5 mM and kcat is 25.3 s(-1). The glucoamylase was partially sequenced on the protein level, and the complete glucoamylase gene including its promoter (but excluding its terminator region) was cloned and sequenced. The glucoamylase protein comprises 617 amino acid residues and shows 60% identity with the glucoamylase from the thermophilic fungus Talaromyces emersonii. cDNA encoding Thermomyces lanuginosus glucoamylase was expression cloned into Pichia pastoris, producing approximately 7.4 U/ml. It was concluded that alternative mRNA splicing as it might occur in Aspergillus niger glucoamylase is not responsible for the occurrence of different glucoamylase isoforms in Thermomyces lanuginosus.

A high efficiency site (with 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and p-hydroquinone catalytic efficiencies of ∼70 and ∼700 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively) was localized at the same exposed Trp-164 responsible for high redox potential substrate oxidation (as shown by activity loss in the W164S variant). The second site, characterized by low catalytic efficiency (∼3 and ∼50 s(-1) mM(-1) for 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and p-hydroquinone, respectively) was localized at the main heme access channel. Steady-state and transient-state kinetics for oxidation of phenols and dyes at the latter site were improved when side chains of residues forming the heme channel edge were removed in single and multiple variants. Among them, the E140G/K176G, E140G/P141G/K176G, and E140G/W164S/K176G variants attained catalytic efficiencies for oxidation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) at the heme channel similar to those of the exposed tryptophan site. The heme channel enlargement shown by x-ray diffraction of the E140G, P141G, K176G, and E140G/K176G variants would allow a better substrate accommodation near the heme, as revealed by the up to 26-fold lower K(m) values (compared with native VP). The resulting interactions were shown by the x-ray structure of the E140G-guaiacol complex, which includes two H-bonds of the substrate with Arg-43 and Pro-139 in the distal heme pocket (at the end of the heme channel) and several hydrophobic interactions with other residues and the heme cofactor. 
20826217	20100910	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Expression and characterization of the Neurospora crassa endoglucanase GH5-1.	Filamentous fungi secrete a wide range of enzymes, including cellulases and hemicellulases, with potential applications in the production of lignocellulosic biofuels. Of the cellulolytic fungi, Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) is the best characterized in terms of cellulose degradation, but other cellulolytic fungi, such as the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, can serve a crucial role in building our knowledge about the fungal response to biomass due to the many molecular and genetic tools available for this organism. Here we cloned and expressed GH5-1 (NCU00762), a secreted endoglucanase in N. crassa. The protein was produced using a ccg-1 promoter under conditions in which no other cellulases are present. Native GH5-1 (nGH5-1) and this recombinant GH5-1 (rGH5-1) were purified to gauge differences in glycosylation and activity; both rGH5-1 and nGH5-1 were similarly glycosylated, with an estimated molecular weight of 52kDa. On azo-carboxymethylcellulose, rGH5-1 activity was equal to that of nGH5-1, and on cellulose (Avicel) rGH5-1 was 20% more active. The activity of a GH5-1-GFP fusion protein (rGH5-1-GFP-6xHis) was similar to rGH5-1 and nGH5-1. To determine the binding pattern of catalytically active rGH5-1-GFP-6xHis to plant cell walls, Arabidopsis seedlings were incubated with rGH5-1-GFP-6xHis or Pontamine Fast Scarlet 4B (S4B), a cellulose-specific dye. Confocal microscopy showed that rGH5-1-GFP-6xHis bound in linear, longitudinal patterns on seedling roots, similar to S4B. The functional expression and characterization of rGH5-1 and its GFP fusion derivative set important precedents for further investigation of biomass degradation by filamentous fungi, especially N. crassa, with applications for characterization and manipulation of novel enzymes. 
22160328	20111214	Biotechnol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	High-level expression and characterization of a highly thermostable chitosanase from Aspergillus fumigatus in Pichia pastoris.	The sequence of an endo-chitosanase gene (CSN) from Aspergillus fumigatus was optimized based on the preferred codons of Pichia pastoris and synthesized in vitro through overlapping PCR (CSN-P). The gene was cloned into a yeast expression vector, pHBM905A, and secretorily expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The yield of CSN-P reached ~3 mg/ml with a high-density fermentation in a 14 l fermenter and the enzyme activity was ~25,000 U/ml. The enzyme had half-lives of 2.5 h at 80°C, 1 h at 90°C and 32 min at 100°C. It retained 70% activity after incubation with 10 M urea at room temperature for 30 min. This enzyme was used for a large-scale preparation of oligosaccharides: 3 g enzyme converted 200 kg chitosan into oligosaccharides in 24 h at 60°C. 
16874542	20060729	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation, characterization, and transcriptional analysis of the chitinase chi2 Gene (DQ011663) from the biocontrol fungus Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae.	Metarhizium anisopliae infects arthropods via a combination of specialized structures and cuticle degradation. Hydrolytic enzymes are accepted as key factors for the host penetration step and include chitinases. The characterization of the chi2 chitinase gene from M. anisopliae var. anisopliae is reported. The chi2 gene is interrupted by two short introns and is 1,542-bp long, coding a predicted protein of 419 amino acids with a stretch of 19 amino acid residues displaying characteristics of signal peptide. The predicted chitinase molecular mass is 44 kDa with a mature protein of 42 kDa and a theoretical pI of 4.8. The comparison of the CHI2 predicted protein to fungal orthologues revealed similarity to the glycohydrolase family 18 and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted. The chi2 gene is up-regulated by chitin as a carbon source and in conditions of fungus autolysis, and is down-regulated by glucose. This regulation is consistent with the presence of putative CreA/Crel/Crr1 carbon catabolic repressor binding domains on the regulatory sequence. 
19809200	20091008	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and expression in Pichia pastoris of a Irpex lacteus exo-beta-(1-->3)-galactanase gene.	A gene encoding exo-beta-(1-->3)-galactanase from Irpex lacteus was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity with exo-beta-(1-->3)-galactanases from other sources. The molecular mass of the mature form was calculated to be 45,520 Da. The gene product expressed in Pichia pastoris specifically hydrolyzed beta-(1-->3)-galactooligosaccharides, as did other exo-beta-(1-->3)-galactanases. The recombinant enzyme showed high activity toward arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) from radish as well as beta-(1-->3)-galactan. Product analysis revealed that the enzyme released beta-(1-->6)-galactobiose, beta-(1-->6)-galactotriose, and alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1-->3)-beta-galactosyl-(1-->6)-galactose together with Gal from beta-(1-->3)-galactans attached with and without beta-(1-->6)-galactosyl branches prepared from acacia gum. These results indicate that the exo-beta-(1-->3)-galactanase from I. lacteus efficiently hydrolyzes beta-(1-->3)-galactan main chains of AGPs by bypassing beta-(1-->6)-galactosyl side chains. 
21442271	20110329	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	The α-glucuronidase Agu1 from Schizophyllum commune is a member of a novel glycoside hydrolase family (GH115).	Schizophyllum commune produces an α-glucuronidase that is active on polymeric xylan, while the ascomycete α-glucuronidases are only active on xylan oligomers. In this study, we have identified the gene (agu1) encoding this enzyme and confirmed the functionality by overexpression of the gene in S. commune and degradation of aldopentauronic acids, (MeGlcA)(3)-Xyl(4), in the cultivation medium of the transformants. Expression analysis demonstrated that agu1 is not co-regulated with the predominant xylanase-encoding gene (xynA) of S. commune. The detailed sequence analysis of Agu1 demonstrated that this gene belongs to a novel glycoside hydrolase family (GH115) that also contains candidate genes from ascomycete fungi and bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the fungal GH115 α-glucuronidases are distinctly separate from the prokaryotic clade and distributed over three branches. The identification of putative genes encoding this enzyme in industrial fungi, such as Aspergillus oryzae and Hypocrea jecorina, will provide a starting point for further analysis of the importance of this enzyme for the hydrolysis of plant biomass. 
19690850	20090820	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and characterization of a bifunctional xylanolytic enzyme from Neocallimastix patriciarum.	A cDNA encoding a bifunctional acetylxylan esterase/xylanase, XynS20E, was cloned from the ruminal fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum. A putative conserved domain of carbohydrate esterase family 1 was observed at the N-terminus and a putative conserved domain of glycosyl hydrolase family 11 was detected at the C-terminus of XynS20E. To examine the enzyme activities, XynS20E was expressed in Escherichia coli as a recombinant His(6) fusion protein and purified by immobilized metal ion-affinity chromatography. Response surface modeling combined with central composite design and regression analysis was then applied to determine the optimal temperature and pH conditions of the recombinant XynS20E. The optimal conditions for the highest xylanase activity of the recombinant XynS20E were observed at a temperature of 49 degrees C and a pH of 5.8, while those for the highest carbohydrate esterase activity were observed at a temperature of 58 degrees C and a pH of 8.2. Under the optimal conditions for the enzyme activity, the xylanase and acetylxylan esterase specific activities of the recombinant XynS20E toward birchwood xylan were 128.7 and 873.1 U mg(-1), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bifunctional xylanolytic enzyme with acetylxylan esterase and xylanase activities from rumen fungus. 
18722595	20080830	Carbohydr._Res.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a novel fungal chitosanase Csn2 from Gongronella sp. JG.	A 28kDa chitosanase designated as Csn2 was purified from the culture broth of the fungus Gongronella sp. JG through three chromatography steps: CM-Sepharose FF, Superdex 200 and SP-Sepharose FF. Its optimal reaction pH and temperature were pH 5.6 and between 55 degrees C and 60 degrees C. The half-lives of Csn2 at 50 degrees C and 55 degrees C were estimated to be 30min and 11min, respectively. The K(m) value of Csn2 in sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.6) at 55 degrees C was 8.86mg/mL. Mn(2+), Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) were activators of Csn2; ETDA was an inhibitor. Cu(2+) stimulated Csn2 at 1mM, but inhibited Csn2 activity at 10mM. Csn2 displayed strong activity on colloidal chitosan, but did not hydrolyze colloidal chitin and carboxylmethyl cellulose. Thin layer chromatography analysis showed the end products of colloidal chitosan hydrolyzed by Csn2 were chitobiose, chitotriose and chitotetraose with chitotriose as the major product. The N terminus of Csn2 was determined to be YQLPANLKKIYDSHKSGTC. Part of the genomic DNA sequence corresponding to Csn2 was cloned. Sequence alignment showed DNA sequence of Csn2 was partly identical to chitosanase genes from Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum, Hypocrea lixii and Aspergillus fumigatus. Based on sequence similarity, Csn2 was classified as a GH-75 chitosanase.

D003160 D016428 D013485 	The feruloyl esterase system of Talaromyces stipitatus: production of three discrete feruloyl esterases, including a novel enzyme, TsFaeC, with a broad substrate specificity.	Several extracellular feruloyl esterases were produced by the mesophilic fungus Talaromyces stipitatus when grown on selective carbon sources in liquid media. Type-A and Type-B feruloyl esterases, as defined by their substrate specificity against methyl hydroxycinnamates, were produced during growth on wheat bran and sugar beet pulp, respectively. In addition, Tal. stipitatus produced a new type of esterase (TsFaeC) during growth on sugar beet pulp with a broader spectrum of activity (Type-C) against the (hydroxy)cinnamate esters than those previously described. All three enzymes were purified and N-terminal amino acid sequences and internal peptide sequences determined. The TsFaeC sequences were used to amplify a gene fragment from Tal. stipitatus genomic DNA. The flanking sequences were identified with the aid of RACE-RTPCR, and a full-length clone constructed. The faeC gene is present as a single copy and contains a single intron. The complete cDNA fragment contains an ORF of 1590bp, faeC, which is predicted to encode a 530 amino acid pre-protein, including a 25-residue signal peptide, and to produce a mature protein of M(R) 55 340Da. There was no evidence for a carbohydrate-binding domain in TsFaeC. 
16232670	20051020	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Transcriptional analysis of two endoinulinase genes inuA and inuB in Aspergillus niger and nucleotide sequences of their promoter regions.	Aspergillus niger 12 contained two copies of endoinulinase genes (inuA and inuB) in the genome (K. Ohta et al., Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 62, 1731-1738, 1998). The inuA- and inuB-specific DNA probes were constructed according to the respective 3'-noncoding sequences that diverged from each other. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from mycelia grown on inulin, fructose, or glucose in submerged culture. Three endoinulinase cDNA sequences that corresponded to the coding regions and their 5'- and 3'-flanking regions were obtained by reverse transcription and subsequent polymerase chain reaction. Southern blot analysis revealed that the amplified cDNA 3'-noncoding sequences hybridized to the inuB probe but not to the inuA probe, regardless of the carbon source. The data suggest that only the inuB gene was transcribed constitutively. Four distinct 5' ends of the transcripts were observed at positions -80(A), -72(G), -69(A), and -65(A) from the start codon. The inuB mRNAs were polyadenylated at various sites between 94 and 297 bp downstream of the stop codon. We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the 1201- and 1017-bp 5'-noncoding regions of the inuA and inuB genes, respectively. The inuB promoter region included a putative TATA box at -116 (TATATA). 
20333513	20100325	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of the family GH54 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases in Penicillium funiculosum, including a novel protein bearing a cellulose-binding domain.	The soil deuteromycete Penicillium funiculosum is characterized by its remarkable capacity to produce a wide variety of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes. In the course of the genome sequencing of this industrial fungus, four different genes encoding glycosyl hydrolase family 54 (GH54)22 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases were identified. Three of them termed PfabfB1, PfabfB3, and PfabfB4 were highly similar, encoding proteins of 507, 508, and 505 amino acids, respectively. They exhibited structural features typical of GH54 enzymes, including an N-terminal catalytic domain connected to a C-terminal arabinose-binding domain (ABD). The fourth gene termed PfafbB2 codes for an unusual 400 amino acid length GH54 alpha-L: -arabinofuranosidase, in which the ABD was replaced by a fungal cellulose-binding domain (fCBD). This domain was shown to be functional since it allowed this protein to be retained onto microcrystalline cellulose, and the fusion of this CBD to the C-terminal end of PfAbfB1 allowed this protein to bind to cellulose. Expression analysis of the four PfabfB genes during an industrial-like process fermentation on complex carbohydrates revealed that PfafB2 was expressed more than 20,000-fold, while PfabfB3 and PfabfB4 were increased moderately at the end of the fermentation. In contrast, the transcript levels of PfabfB1 remained unchanged throughout the process. This new type of GH54 alpha-arabinofuranosidase encoded by PfabfB2 showed enzymatic properties slightly different to those of other GH54 enzymes characterized so far, including a higher thermostability, an optimum pH, and temperature of 2.6 and 50 degrees C, instead of 3.5 and 60 degrees C as found for PfAbfB1. Nonetheless, like other GH54 alpha-arabinofuranosidases, PfAbfB2 was able to release arabinose from various sources of branched arabinoxylan and arabinan. 
7984103	19940701	Mol._Microbiol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	A novel, small endoglucanase gene, egl5, from Trichoderma reesei isolated by expression in yeast.	A method is presented for the isolation of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes without any knowledge of the corresponding proteins. cDNA made from the organism of interest is cloned into a yeast vector to construct an expression library in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Colonies producing hydrolytic enzymes are screened by activity plate assays. In this work, we constructed a yeast expression library from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei and isolated a new beta-1,4-endoglucanase gene on plates containing beta-glucan. This gene, egl5, codes for a previously unknown small protein of 242 amino acids. Despite its small size, the protein contains two conservative domains found in Trichoderma cellulases, namely the cellulose-binding domain (CBD) and the linker region that connects the CBD to the catalytic core domain. Molecular modelling of the EGV CBD revealed some interesting structural differences compared to the CBD of the major cellulase CBHI from T. reesei. The catalytic core of EGV is unusually small for a cellulase and represents a new family of cellulases (Family K) and of glycosyl hydrolases (Family 45) together with the endoglucanase B of Pseudomonas fluorescens and the endoglucanase V of Humicola insolens on the basis of hydrophobic cluster analysis. 
11829749	20020207	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	Purification, characterization, gene cloning and preliminary X-ray data of the exo-inulinase from Aspergillus awamori.	Extracellular exo-inulinase has been isolated from a solid-phase culture of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus awamori var. 2250. The apparent molecular mass of the monomer enzyme was 69 +/- kDa, with a pI of 4.4 and a pH optimum of 4.5. The enzyme hydrolysed the beta-(2-->1)-fructan (inulin) and beta-(2-->6)-fructan (levan) via exo-cleavage, releasing fructose. The values for the Michaelis constants K(m) and V(max) in the hydrolysis of inulin were 0.003 +/- 0.0001 mM and 175 +/- 5 micromol.min(-1).mg(-1). The same parameters in the hydrolysis of levan were 2.08 +/- 0.04 mg/ml and 1.2 +/- 0.02 micromol/min per mg, respectively. The gene and cDNA encoding the A. awamori exo-inulinase were cloned and sequenced. The amino acid sequence indicated that the protein belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 32. A surprisingly high similarity was found to fructosyltransferase from Aspergillus foetidus (90.7% on the level of the amino acid sequence), despite the fact that the latter enzyme is unable to hydrolyse inulin and levan. Crystals of the native exo-inulinase were obtained and found to belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with cell parameters a=64.726 A (1A=0.1 nm), b=82.041 A and c=136.075 A. Crystals diffracted beyond 1.54 A, and useful X-ray data were collected to a resolution of 1.73 A. 
20851958	20100921	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	New insights into the fructosyltransferase activity of Schwanniomyces occidentalis ß-fructofuranosidase, emerging from nonconventional codon usage and directed mutation.	Schwanniomyces occidentalis β-fructofuranosidase (Ffase) releases β-fructose from the nonreducing ends of β-fructans and synthesizes 6-kestose and 1-kestose, both considered prebiotic fructooligosaccharides. Analyzing the amino acid sequence of this protein revealed that it includes a serine instead of a leucine at position 196, caused by a nonuniversal decoding of the unique mRNA leucine codon CUG. Substitution of leucine for Ser196 dramatically lowers the apparent catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of the enzyme (approximately 1,000-fold), but surprisingly, its transferase activity is enhanced by almost 3-fold, as is the enzymes' specificity for 6-kestose synthesis. The influence of 6 Ffase residues on enzyme activity was analyzed on both the Leu196/Ser196 backgrounds (Trp47, Asn49, Asn52, Ser111, Lys181, and Pro232). Only N52S and P232V mutations improved the transferase activity of the wild-type enzyme (about 1.6-fold). Modeling the transfructosylation products into the active site, in combination with an analysis of the kinetics and transfructosylation reactions, defined a new region responsible for the transferase specificity of the enzyme.

D003160 D016428 	A lichenase-like family 12 endo-(1-->4)-beta-glucanase from Aspergillus japonicus: study of the substrate specificity and mode of action on beta-glucans in comparison with other glycoside hydrolases.	Using anion-exchange chromatography on Source 15Q followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on Source 15 Isopropyl, a lichenase-like endo-(1-->4)-beta-glucanase (BG, 28kDa, pI4.1) was isolated from a culture filtrate of Aspergillus japonicus. The enzyme was highly active against barley beta-glucan and lichenan (263 and 267 U/mg protein) and had much lower activity toward carboxymethylcellulose (3.9 U/mg). The mode of action of the BG on barley beta-glucan and lichenan was studied in comparison with that of Bacillus subtilis lichenase and endo-(1-->4)-beta-glucanases (EG I, II, and III) of Trichoderma reesei. The BG behaved very similar to the bacterial lichenase, except the tri- and tetrasaccharides formed as the end products of beta-glucan hydrolysis with the BG contained the beta-(1-->3)-glucoside linkage at the non-reducing end, while the lichenase-derived oligosaccharides had the beta-(1-->3)-linkage at the reducing end. The BG was characterized by a high amino acid sequence identity to the EG of Aspergillus kawachii (UniProt entry Q12679) from a family 12 of glycoside hydrolases (96% in 162 identified aa residues out of total 223 residues) and also showed lower sequence similarity to the EglA of Aspergillus niger (O74705). 
1479358	19921101	J._Gen._Microbiol.	D016428 	A novel polysaccharide hydrolase cDNA (celD) from Neocallimastix patriciarum encoding three multi-functional catalytic domains with high endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase and xylanase activities.	A plant polysaccharide hydrolase cDNA, designated celD, was isolated from a cDNA library of the rumen fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum. The enzyme encoded by celD had endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase and xylanase activities. Deletion analysis revealed that celD cDNA can be truncated to code for three catalytically active domains. Each domain had the same substrate specificity as the enzyme produced by the untruncated celD and also possessed cellulose-binding capacity. Substrate competition studies showed that carboxymethylcellulose and xylan appear to compete with methylumbelliferyl cellobioside for the same active site within each domain. Expression of celD transcript in the rumen fungus was constitutive and was not affected by the presence of cellulose in the culture medium. 
22750808	20120704	Biochimie	D016428 D013485 	First crystal structure of an endo-inulinase, INU2, from Aspergillus ficuum: discovery of an extra-pocket in the catalytic domain responsible for its endo-activity.	Endo-inulinase is a member of glycosidase hydrolase family 32 (GH32) degrading fructans of the inulin type with an endo-cleavage mode and is an important class of industrial enzyme. In the present study, we report the first crystal structure of an endo-inulinase, INU2, from Aspergillus ficuum at 1.5 Å. It was solved by molecular replacement with the structure of exo-inulinase as search model. The 3D structure presents a bimodular arrangement common to other GH32 enzymes: a N-terminal 5-fold β-propeller catalytic domain with four β-sheets and a C-terminal β-sandwich domain organized in two β-sheets with five β-strands. The structural analysis and comparison with other GH32 enzymes reveal the presence of an extra pocket in the INU2 catalytic site, formed by two loops and the conserved motif W-M(I)-N-D(E)-P-N-G. This cavity would explain the endo-activity of the enzyme, the critical role of Trp40 and particularly the cleavage at the third unit of the inulin(-like) substrates. Crystal structure at 2.1 Å of INU2 complexed with fructosyl molecules, experimental digestion data and molecular modelling studies support these hypotheses.

D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of a gene for an alpha-glucosidase from Saccharomycopsis fibuligera homologous to family GH31 of yeast glucoamylases.	Cloning of cDNA encoding an alpha-glucosidase from the dimorphous yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera and characterization of the gene product were performed. The cDNA of the putative alpha-glucosidase gene consists of 2,886 bp, which includes an open reading frame encoding a 19 amino acid signal peptide at the N-terminal end and a 944 amino acid mature protein with a predicted molecular mass of 105.4 kDa and pI value of 4.52. The deduced amino acid sequence shows a high degree of identity (70%) with two yeast glucoamylases, namely, the extracellular glucoamylase Gam from Schwanniomyces occidentalis and the cell surface glucoamylase Gca from Candida albicans. The recombinant product, synthesized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is localized on the cell surface and hydrolyses maltooligosaccharides exclusively without the ability to digest soluble starch, which is consistent with the specificity characteristic of alpha-glucosidase, EC. 3.2.1.20. 
23719223	20130531	Fungal_Biol	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a recombinant α-glucuronidase from Aspergillus fumigatus.	The degradation of xylan requires the action of glycanases and esterases which hydrolyse, in a synergistic fashion, the main chain and the different substituents which decorate its structure. Among the xylanolytic enzymes acting on side-chains are the α-glucuronidases (AguA) (E.C. 3.2.1.139) which release methyl glucuronic acid residues. These are the least studies among the xylanolytic enzymes. In this work, the gene and cDNA of an α-glucuronidase from a newly isolated strain of Aspergillus fumigatus have been sequenced, and the gene has been expressed in Pichia pastoris. The gene is 2523 bp long, has no introns and codes for a protein of 840 amino acid residues including a putative signal peptide of 19 residues. The mature protein has a calculated molecular weight of 91,725 and shows 99 % identity with a putative α-glucuronidase from A. fumigatus A1163. The recombinant enzyme was expressed with a histidine tag and was purified to near homogeneity with a nickel nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight near 100,000. It is inactive using birchwood glucuronoxylan as substrate. Activity is observed in the presence of xylooligosaccharides generated from this substrate by a family 10 endoxylanase and when a mixture of aldouronic acids are used as substrates. If, instead, family 11 endoxylanase is used to generate oligosaccharides, no activity is detected, indicating a different specificity in the cleavage of xylan by family 10 and 11 endoxylanases. Enzyme activity is optimal at 37 °C and pH 4.5-5. The enzyme binds cellulose, thus it likely possesses a carbohydrate binding module. Based on its properties and sequence similarities the catalytic module of the newly described α-glucuronidase can be classified in family 67 of the glycosyl hydrolases. The recombinant enzyme may be useful for biotechnological applications of α-glucuronidases.

The exo-beta-(1,3)-glucanase from Candida albicans hydrolyzes cell wall beta-glucans via a double-displacement mechanism involving a glycosyl enzyme intermediate. Reaction of the enzyme with 2',4'-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-glucopyranoside resulted in the time-dependent inactivation of this enzyme via the accumulation of a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glycosyl-enzyme intermediate as monitored also by electrospray mass spectrometry. The catalytic competence of this intermediate is demonstrated by its reactivation through hydrolysis (kreact = 0.0019 min-1) and by transglycosylation to benzyl thio-beta-D-glucopyranoside (kreact = 0.024 min-1; Kreact = 56 mM). Peptic digestion of the labeled enzyme followed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis in the neutral loss mode allowed detection of two glycosylated active site peptides, the sequences of which were identified as NVAGEW and NVAGEWSAA. A crucial role for Glu-330 is confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis at this site and kinetic analysis of the resultant mutant. The activity of the Glu-330 --> Gln mutant is reduced over 50,000-fold compared to the wild type enzyme. The glutamic acid, identified in the exoglucanase as Glu-330, is completely conserved in this family of enzymes and is hereby identified as the catalytic nucleophile. 
22132148	20111202	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 	The putative endoglucanase PcGH61D from Phanerochaete chrysosporium is a metal-dependent oxidative enzyme that cleaves cellulose.	Many fungi growing on plant biomass produce proteins currently classified as glycoside hydrolase family 61 (GH61), some of which are known to act synergistically with cellulases. In this study we show that PcGH61D, the gene product of an open reading frame in the genome of Phanerochaete chrysosporium, is an enzyme that cleaves cellulose using a metal-dependent oxidative mechanism that leads to generation of aldonic acids. The activity of this enzyme and its beneficial effect on the efficiency of classical cellulases are stimulated by the presence of electron donors. Experiments with reduced cellulose confirmed the oxidative nature of the reaction catalyzed by PcGH61D and indicated that the enzyme may be capable of penetrating into the substrate. Considering the abundance of GH61-encoding genes in fungi and genes encoding their functional bacterial homologues currently classified as carbohydrate binding modules family 33 (CBM33), this enzyme activity is likely to turn out as a major determinant of microbial biomass-degrading efficiency. 
16374635	20051224	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Hydrolysis of beta-1,3/1,6-glucan by glycoside hydrolase family 16 endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	When Phanerochaete chrysosporium was grown with laminarin (a beta-1,3/1,6-glucan) as the sole carbon source, a beta-1,3-glucanase with a molecular mass of 36 kDa was produced as a major extracellular protein. The cDNA encoding this enzyme was cloned, and the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that this enzyme belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 16; it was named Lam16A. Recombinant Lam16A, expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, randomly hydrolyzes linear beta-1,3-glucan, branched beta-1,3/1,6-glucan, and beta-1,3-1,4-glucan, suggesting that the enzyme is a typical endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6) with broad substrate specificity for beta-1,3-glucans. When laminarin and lichenan were used as substrates, Lam16A produced 6-O-glucosyl-laminaritriose (beta-D-Glcp-(1->6)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->3)-D-Glc) and 4-O-glucosyl-laminaribiose (beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->3)-D-Glc), respectively, as one of the major products. These results suggested that the enzyme strictly recognizes beta-D-Glcp-(1->3)-D-Glcp at subsites -2 and -1, whereas it permits 6-O-glucosyl substitution at subsite +1 and a beta-1,4-glucosidic linkage at the catalytic site. Consequently, Lam16A generates non-branched oligosaccharide from branched beta-1,3/1,6-glucan and, thus, may contribute to the effective degradation of such molecules in combination with other extracellular beta-1,3-glucanases. 
19655217	20090806	Extremophiles	D016428 D013485 	A thermophilic and acid stable family-10 xylanase from the acidophilic fungus Bispora sp. MEY-1.	A complete gene, xyl10C, encoding a thermophilic endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (XYL10C), was cloned from the acidophilic fungus Bispora sp. MEY-1 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. XYL10C shares highest nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of 57.3 and 49.7%, respectively, with a putative xylanase from Aspergillus fumigatus Af293 of glycoside hydrolase family 10. A high expression level in P. pastoris (73,400 U ml(-1)) was achieved in a 3.7-l fermenter. The purified recombinant XYL10C was thermophilic, exhibiting maximum activity at 85 degrees C, which is higher than that reported from any fungal xylanase. The enzyme was also highly thermostable, exhibiting approximately 100% of the initial activity after incubation at 80 degrees C for 60 min and >87% of activity at 90 degrees C for 10 min. The half lives of XYL10C at 80 and 85 degrees C were approximately 45 and 3 h, respectively. It had two activity peaks at pH 3.0 and 4.5-5.0 (maximum), respectively, and was very acid stable, retaining more than 80% activity after incubation at pH 1.5-6.0 for 1 h. The enzyme was resistant to Co(2+), Mn(2+), Cr(3+) and Ag(+). The specific activity of XYL10C for oat spelt xylan was 18,831 U mg(-1). It also had wide substrate specificity and produced simple products (65.1% xylose, 25.0% xylobiose and 9.9% xylan polymer) from oat spelt xylan. 
12665550	20030401	J._Cell._Sci.	D016428 D013485 	The endo-beta-1,3-glucanase eng1p is required for dissolution of the primary septum during cell separation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.	Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells divide by medial fission throughout contraction of an actomyosin ring and deposition of a multilayered division septum that must be cleaved to release the two daughter cells. Although many studies have focused on the actomoysin ring and septum assembly, little information is available concerning the mechanism of cell separation. Here we describe the characterization of eng1+, a new gene that encodes a protein with detectable endo-beta-1,3-glucanase activity and whose deletion is not lethal to the cells but does interfere in their separation. Electron microscopic observation of mutant cells indicated that this defect is mainly due to the failure of the cells to degrade the primary septum, a structure rich in beta-1,3-glucans, that separates the two sisters cells. Expression of eng1+ varies during the cell cycle, maximum expression being observed before septation, and the protein localizes to a ring-like structure that surrounds the septum region during cell separation. This suggests that it could also be involved in the cleavage of the cylinder of the cell wall that covers the division septum. The expression of eng1+ during vegetative growth is regulated by a C2H2 zinc-finger protein (encoded by the SPAC6G10.12c ORF), which shows significant sequence similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ScAce2p, especially in the zinc-finger region. Mutants lacking this transcriptional regulator (which we have named ace2+) show a severe cell separation defect, hyphal growth being observed. Thus, ace2p may regulate the expression of the eng1+ gene together with that of other genes whose products are also involved in cell separation. 
8975597	19960301	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Expression of a Trichoderma reesei beta-xylanase gene (XYN2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	The XYN2 gene encoding the main Trichoderma reesei QM 6a endo-beta-1,4-xylanase was amplified by PCR from first-strand cDNA synthesized on mRNA isolated from the fungus. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment was verified to contain a 699-bp open reading frame that encodes a 223-amino-acid propeptide. The XYN2 gene, located on URA3-based multicopy shuttle vectors, was successfully expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase II (ADH2) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) gene promoters and terminators, respectively. The 33-amino-acid leader peptide of the Xyn2 beta-xylanase was recognized and cleaved at the Kex2-like Lys-Arg residues, enabling the efficient secretion and glycosylation of the heterologous beta-xylanase. The molecular mass of the recombinant beta-xylanase was estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 27 kDa. The construction of fur1 ura3 S. cerevisiae strains allowed for the autoselection of the URA3-based XYN2 shuttle vectors in nonselective complex medium. These autoselective S. cerevisiae strains produced 1,200 and 160 nkat of beta-xylanase activity per ml under the control of the ADH2 and PGK1 promoters in rich medium, respectively. The recombinant enzyme showed highest activity at pH 6 and 60 degrees C and retained more than 90% of its activity after 60 min at 50 degrees C. 
22776993	20120711	J._Ind._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Redefining XynA from Penicillium funiculosum IMI 378536 as a GH7 cellobiohydrolase.	The secretome of Penicillium funiculosum contains two family GH7 enzymes, one of which (designated XynA) has been described as a xylanase. This is unusual because it is the only xylanase in family GH7, which is mainly composed of cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases, and also because XynA is highly similar to the cellobiohydrolase I from Talaromyces emersonii and Trichoderma reesei (72 and 65 % identity, respectively). To probe this enigma, we investigated the biochemical properties of XynA, notably its activity on xylans and β-D-glucans. A highly pure sample of XynA was obtained and used to perform hydrolysis tests on polysaccharides. These revealed that XynA is 100-fold more active on β-1,4-glucan than on xylan. Likewise, XynA was active on both 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-lactopyranoside (pNP-β-D-Lac) and 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside (pNP-cellobiose), which shows that XynA is principally an exo-acting type 1 cellobiohydrolase enzyme that displays 5.2-fold higher performance on pNP-cellobiose than on pNP-β-D-Lac. Finally, analyses performed using cellodextrins as substrate revealed that XynA mainly produced cellobiose (C2) from substrates containing three or more glucosyl subunits, and that C2 inhibits XynA at high concentrations (IC(50) (C2) = 17.7 μM). Overall, this study revealed that XynA displays typical cellobiohydrolase 1 activity and confirms that the description of this enzyme in public databases should be definitively amended. Moreover, the data provided here complete the information provided by a previous proteomics investigation and reveal that P. funiculosum secretes a complete set of cellulose-degrading enzymes. 
18071262	20071212	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Molecular cloning and characterization of an alpha-amylase from Pichia burtonii 15-1.	An alpha-amylase secreted by Pichia burtonii 15-1 isolated from a traditional starter murcha of Nepal, named Pichia burtonii alpha-amylase (PBA), was studied. The gene was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. PBA was deduced to consist of 494 amino acid residues. It shared certain degrees of amino acid sequence identity with other homologous proteins: 60% with Schwanniomyces occidentalis alpha-amylase, 58% with Saccharomycopsis sp. alpha-amylase, and 47% with Taka-amylase A from Aspergillus oryzae. A three-dimensional structural model of PBA generated using the known three-dimensional structure of Taka-amylase A as a template suggested high structural similarity between them. Kinetic analysis revealed that the K(m) values of PBA were lower than those of Taka-amylase A for the oligosaccharides. Although the k(cat) values of PBA were lower than those of Taka-amylase A for the oligosaccharide substrates, the k(cat)/K(m) values of PBA were higher. 
10636904	20000115	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 	Biochemical analysis of recombinant fungal mutanases. A new family of alpha1,3-glucanases with novel carbohydrate-binding domains.	Nucleotide sequence analysis shows that Trichoderma harzianum and Penicillium purpurogenum alpha1,3-glucanases (mutanases) have homologous primary structures (53% amino acid sequence identity), and are composed of two distinct domains: a NH(2)-terminal catalytic domain and a putative COOH-terminal polysaccharide-binding domain separated by a O-glycosylated Pro-Ser-Thr-rich linker peptide. Each mutanase was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae host under the transcriptional control of a strong alpha-amylase gene promoter. The purified recombinant mutanases show a pH optimum in the range from pH 3.5 to 4.5 and a temperature optimum around 50-55 degrees C at pH 5.5. Also, they exhibit strong binding to insoluble mutan with K(D) around 0.11 and 0.13 microM at pH 7 for the P. purpurogenum and T. harzianum mutanases, respectively. Partial hydrolysis showed that the COOH-terminal domain of the T. harzianum mutanase binds to mutan. The catalytic domains and the binding domains were assigned to a new family of glycoside hydrolases and to a new family of carbohydrate-binding domains, respectively. 
16233094	20051020	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of an acidophilic xylanase from Aureobasidium pullulans var. melanigenum and sequence analysis of the encoding gene.	An extracellular endo-1,4-beta-xylanase was purified from the culture supernatant of Aureobasidium pullulans var. melanigenum (ATCC 20524) grown on oat-spelt xylan. The purified enzyme showed a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent M(r) of 24 kDa and had an isoelectric point of 6.7. Xylanase activity was optimal at pH 2.0 and 50 degrees C. The genomic DNA and cDNAs encoding this protein were cloned and sequenced. Southern blot analysis indicated that the xylanase gene (xynI) was present as a single copy in the genome. An open reading frame, consisting of 663 bp, encoded a presumed prepropeptide of 34 amino acids and a mature protein of 187 amino acid. The DNA region encoding the prepeptide was interrupted by a 59-bp intron. A single transcription start point was observed at position -46 (A) from the start codon. The 5'-noncoding region had a putative TATA box at -91 (TATATAA) and two possible CCAAT boxes at -247 (CAAT) and -283 (CCAAT). A cloned xynI cDNA was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 94% identity with that of a previously reported equivalent gene (xynA) encoding a xylanase with an optimal pH of 4.8 from a color variant strain, NRRL Y-2311-1, of A. pullulans. A neighbor-joining tree showed that the Aureobasidium enzymes are closely related to several other family-11 xylanases from black aspergilli and Penicillium purpurogenum. 
12623067	20030308	Arch._Biochem._Biophys.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and 3D structure prediction of the first raw-starch-degrading glucoamylase without a separate starch-binding domain.	Raw-starch-degrading glucoamylases have been known as multidomain enzymes consisting of a catalytic domain connected to a starch-binding domain (SBD) by an O-glycosylated linker region. A molecular genetics approach has been chosen to find structural differences between two related glucoamylases, raw-starch-degrading Glm and nondegrading Glu, from the yeasts Saccharomycopsis fibuligera IFO 0111 and HUT 7212, respectively. We have found that Glm and Glu show a high primary (77%) and tertiary structure similarity. Glm, although possessing a good ability for raw starch degradation, did not show consensus amino acid residues to any SBD found in glucoamylases or other amylolytic enzymes. Raw starch binding and digestion by Glm must thus depend on the existence of a site(s) lying within the intact protein which lacks a separate SBD. The enzyme represents a structurally new type of raw-starch-degrading glucoamylase.

D016428 D013485 	Cloning, expression, and characterization of a thermostable GH7 endoglucanase from Myceliophthora thermophila capable of high-consistency enzymatic liquefaction.	An endoglucanase gene from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila, belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 7, was functionally expressed in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The putative endoglucanase from the genomic DNA was successfully cloned in P. pastoris X-33 and the recombinant enzyme was purified to its homogeneity (65 kDa) and subsequently characterized. Substrate specificity analysis revealed that the enzyme exhibits high activity on substrates containing β-1,4-glycosidic bonds such as carboxymethyl cellulose, barley β-glucan, and cello-oligosaccharides, as well as activity on xylan-containing substrates, including arabinoxylan and oat spelt xylan. MtEG7a was proved to liquefy rapidly and efficiently pretreated wheat straw, indicating its key role to the initial step of hydrolysis of high-solids lignocellulose substrates. High thermostability of the endoglucanase reflects potential commercial significance of the enzyme. 
11956748	20020417	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Construction of a flocculent Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain secreting high levels of Aspergillus niger beta-galactosidase.	A flocculent Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain secreting Aspergillus niger beta-galactosidase activity was constructed by transforming S. cerevisiae NCYC869-A3 strain with plasmid pVK1.1 harboring the A. niger beta-galactosidase gene, lacA, under the control of the ADH1 promoter and terminator. Compared to other recombinant S. cerevisiae strains, this recombinant yeast has higher levels of extracellular beta-galactosidase activity. In shake-flask cultures, the beta-galactosidase activity detected in the supernatant was 20 times higher than that obtained with previously constructed strains (Domingues et al. 2000a). In bioreactor culture, with cheese-whey permeate as substrate, a yield of 878.0 nkat/gsubstrate was obtained. The recombinant strain is an attractive alternative to other fungal beta-galactosidase production systems as the enzyme is produced in a rather pure form. Moreover, the use of flocculating yeast cells allows for enzyme production with high productivity in continuous fermentation systems with facilitated downstream processing. 
8640604	19960501	Can._J._Microbiol.	D016428 	Production of beta-glucosidase and diauxic usage of sugar mixtures by Candida molischiana.	The fermentation of cellobiose is a rare trait among yeasts. Of the 308 yeast species that utilize cellobiose aerobically, only 12 species ferment it, and only 2 species, Candida molischiana and Candida wickerhamii, also ferment cellodextrins. Candida molischiana produced beta-glucosidase activity on all carbon sources tested, except glucose, mannose, and fructose. When these sugars were added to cultures growing on cellobiose, the synthesis of beta-glucosidase ceased. However, the total amount of enzyme activity remained constant, indicating that the C. molischiana beta-glucosidase is catabolite repressed and not catabolite inactivated. When grown in medium initially containing glucose plus xylose, cellobiose, maltose, mannitol, or glucitol, C. molischiana preferentially utilized glucose and produced little beta-glucosidase activity until glucose was nearly depleted from the medium. When grown in medium containing cellobiose plus either fructose or mannose, the yeast preferentially utilized the monosaccharides and produced little beta-glucosidase activity. Candida molischiana produced beta-glucosidase and co-utilized cellobiose and xylose, maltose, or trehalose. Glucose and fructose, mannose, or trehalose were co-utilized; however, no beta-glucosidase activity was detected. Thus, the order of substrate preference groups appeared to be (glucose, trehalose, fructose, mannose) > (cellobiose, maltose, xylose) > (mannitol, glucitol).

D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a protease-resistant α-galactosidase from the thermophilic fungus Rhizomucor miehei and its application in removal of raffinose family oligosaccharides.	The α-galactosidase gene, RmGal36, from Rhizomucor miehei was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene has an open reading frame of 2256bp encoding 751 amino acid residues. RmGal36 was optimally active at pH 4.5 and 60°C, but is stable between pH 4.5 and 10.0 and at a temperature of up to 55°C for 30min retaining more than 80% of its relative activity. It displayed remarkable resistance to proteases and its activity was not inhibited by galactose concentrations of 100mM. The relative specificity of RmGal36 towards various substrates is in the order of p-nitrophenyl α-galactopyranoside>melibiose>stachyose>raffinose, with a K(m) of 0.36, 16.9, 27.6, and 47.9mM, respectively. The enzyme completely hydrolyzed raffinose and stachyose present in soybeans and kidney beans at 50°C within 60min. These features make RmGal36 useful in the food and feed industries and in processing of beet-sugar. 
18676702	20080805	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of an endoglucanase belonging to a new subfamily of glycoside hydrolase family 45 of the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	The wood decay fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has served as a model system for the study of lignocellulose conversions, but aspects of its cellulolytic system remain uncertain. Here, we report identifying the gene that encodes the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 45 endoglucanase (EG) from the fungus, cloning the cDNA, determining its heterologous expression in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, and characterizing the recombinant protein. The cDNA consisted of 718 bp, including an open reading frame encoding a 19-amino-acid signal peptide, a 7-amino-acid presequence at the N-terminal region, and a 180-amino-acid mature protein, which has no cellulose binding domain. Analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed that the protein has a low similarity (<22%) to known fungal EGs belonging to the GH family 45 (EGVs). No conserved domain of this family was found by a BLAST search, suggesting that the protein should be classified into a new subdivision of this GH family. The recombinant protein has hydrolytic activity toward amorphous cellulose, carboxylmethyl cellulose, lichenan, barley beta-glucan, and glucomannan but not xylan. Moreover, a synergistic effect was observed with the recombinant GH family 6 cellobiohydrolase from the same fungus toward amorphous cellulose as a substrate, indicating that the enzyme may act in concert with other cellulolytic enzymes to hydrolyze cellulosic biomass in nature. 
15866877	20050504	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 	An exo-beta-1,3-galactanase having a novel beta-1,3-galactan-binding module from Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	An exo-beta-1,3-galactanase gene from Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The complete amino acid sequence of the exo-beta-1,3-galactanase indicated that the enzyme consists of an N-terminal catalytic module with similarity to glycoside hydrolase family 43 and an additional unknown functional domain similar to carbohydrate-binding module family 6 (CBM6) in the C-terminal region. The molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was estimated as 55 kDa based on SDS-PAGE. The enzyme showed reactivity only toward beta-1,3-linked galactosyl oligosaccharides and polysaccharide as substrates but did not hydrolyze beta-1,4-linked galacto-oligosaccharides, beta-1,6-linked galacto-oligosaccharides, pectic galactan, larch arabinogalactan, arabinan, gum arabic, debranched arabinan, laminarin, soluble birchwood xylan, or soluble oat spelled xylan. The enzyme also did not hydrolyze beta-1,3-galactosyl galactosaminide, beta-1,3-galactosyl glucosaminide, or beta-1,3-galactosyl arabinofuranoside, suggesting that it specifically cleaves the internal beta-1,3-linkage of two galactosyl residues. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the hydrolysis products showed that the enzyme produced galactose from beta-1,3-galactan in an exo-acting manner. However, no activity toward p-nitrophenyl beta-galactopyranoside was detected. When incubated with arabinogalactan proteins, the enzyme produced oligosaccharides together with galactose, suggesting that it is able to bypass beta-1,6-linked galactosyl side chains. The C-terminal CBM6 did not show any affinity for known substrates of CBM6 such as xylan, cellulose, and beta-1,3-glucan, although it bound beta-1,3-galactan when analyzed by affinity electrophoresis. Frontal affinity chromatography for the CBM6 moiety using several kinds of terminal galactose-containing oligosaccharides as the analytes clearly indicated that the CBM6 specifically interacted with oligosaccharides containing a beta-1,3-galactobiose moiety. When the degree of polymerization of galactose oligomers was increased, the binding affinity of the CBM6 showed no marked change.

D016428 	Cloning of the alpha-amylase cDNA of Aspergillus shirousamii and its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	alpha-Amylase cDNA was cloned and sequenced from Aspergillus shirousamii RIB2504. The putative protein deduced from the cDNA open reading frame (ORF) consisted of 499 amino acids with a molecular weight of 55,000. The amino acid sequence was identical to that of the ORF of the Taka-amylase A gene of Aspergillus oryzae, while the nucleotide sequence was different at two and six positions in the cDNA ORF and 3' non-coding regions, respectively, so far determined. The alpha-amylase cDNA was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the yeast ADH1 promoter using a YEp-type plasmid, pYcDE1. The cDNA of glucoamylase, which was previously cloned from the same organism, was also expressed under the same conditions. Consequently, active alpha-amylase and glucoamylase were efficiently secreted into the culture medium. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal regions of these enzymes purified from the yeast culture medium confirmed that the signal sequences of these enzymes were cleaved off at the same positions as those of the native enzymes of A. shirousamii. 
16202538	20051006	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 	Characteristics of transxylosylation by beta-xylosidase from Aspergillus awamori K4.	The Aspergillus awamori K4 beta-xylosidase gene (Xaw1) sequence was deduced by sequencing RT-PCR and PCR products. The ORF was 2,412 bp and the predicted peptide was 804 amino acids long, corresponding to a molecular weight of 87,156 Da. The mature protein was 778 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 84,632 Da. A homology search of the amino acid sequence revealed that it was very similar to the Aspergillus niger beta-xylosidase gene with only five amino acid differences. K4 beta-xylosidase had the same catalytic mechanism as family 3 beta-glucosidases, involving Asp in region A. At an early stage in the reaction with xylobiose and xylotriose, the hydrolysis rate was much lower than the transxylosylation rate, decreasing gradually as the substrate concentration increased, whereas the transxylosylation rate increased greatly. Aspergillus awamori K4 beta-xylosidase had broad acceptor specificity toward alcohols, hydroxybenzenealcohols, sugar alcohols and disaccharides. A consensus portion involving the hydroxymethyl group of the acceptor was confirmed in the major transfer products 1(4)-O-beta-D-xylosyl erythritol, (2-hydroxyl)-phenyl-methyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside, 6S-O-beta-D-xylosyl maltitol (S: sorbitol residue) and 6G-O-beta-D-xylosyl palatinose (G: glucosyl residue). This might suggest that the methylene in the hydroxymethyl group facilitates base-catalyzed hydroxyl group attack of the anomeric center of the xylosyl-enzyme intermediate.

The phytopathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis exists in a yeast-like haploid form and as a filamentous dikaryon. Only the dikaryon can infect corn plants. We have isolated a gene, egl1, that is not expressed in haploid cells but strongly induced in the filament. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that egl1 encodes a cellulase. By immunogold labelling, secreted protein could be detected at the hyphal tip. Mutants deleted for egl1 are viable and are affected neither in filament formation nor in pathogenic development under the conditions tested.

Aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO), an extracellular enzyme characteristic of fungi from the genus Pleurotus, constitutes a source for H2O2 required in lignin biodegradation. The gene aao has been cloned, sequenced and characterized for the first time in Pleurotus eryngii. Both cDNA and genomic libraries were screened with probes obtained by PCR using as primers oligonucleotides corresponding to the N-terminus and internal sequences of AAO. DNA sequences from positive clones showed a unique open reading frame of 1779 nucleotides interrupted by 12 introns. The conceptual translation of the protein agrees with the partial amino acid sequences obtained from protein sequencing. A search for proteins with related amino-acid sequences revealed that glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger has 33% identity and 51% similarity. A comparison with other oxidoreductases showed common motifs in both N- and C-terminal regions corresponding, respectively, to the FAD-binding region and the enzyme active site. However, AAO probably has structural differences with other oxidases, as deduced from its unique ability to generate H2O2 from the oxidation of aromatic alcohols. 
18499053	20080524	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and properties of family-10 endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from Penicillium citrinum and structural organization of encoding gene.	An extracellular endo-1,4-beta-xylanase was purified from the culture filtrate of a filamentous fungus, Penicillium citrinum strain FERM P-15944, grown on birch-wood xylan. The purified enzyme showed a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent M(r) of 31.6 kDa. The xylanase activity was optimal at pH 6.0 and 50 degrees C. Southern blot analysis indicated that the xylanase gene (xynB) was present as a single copy in the genome. The genomic DNA and cDNAs encoding this protein were cloned and sequenced. An open reading frame of xynB was interrupted by nine introns and encoded a presumed prepropeptide of 25 amino acids and a mature protein of 302 amino acids. Sequence alignment and the constructed neighbor-joining tree showed that the P. citrinum enzyme belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 10 and is closely related to several other xylanases from penicillia and black aspergilli. The xynB cDNA was functionally expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. 
18550352	20080614	Mycol._Res.	D016428 D013485 	A family 51 alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase from Penicillium purpurogenum: purification, properties and amino acid sequence.	The soft rot fungus Penicillium purpurogenum secretes a wide variety of xylanolytic enzymes to the medium, among them three alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases. This work refers to arabinofuranosidase 2 (ABF 2). This enzyme was purified to homogeneity and characterized; it is a glycosylated monomer with a molecular weight of 70 000 and an isoelectric point of 5.3. When assayed with p-nitrophenyl alpha-l-arabinofuranoside (pNPAra) the enzyme followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K(M) of 0.098mm. The optimum pH is 5 and the optimal temperature 60 degrees C. ABF 2 showed weak activity on natural polymeric substrates, such as sugar beet arabinan, debranched arabinan, and arabinoxylan. These results, together with its low K(M) (pNPAra) and its activity towards short arabinooligosaccharides, suggest that the enzyme belongs to the exo alpha-l-arabinosyl hydrolases not active on polymers. The abf2 gene and its cDNA were sequenced, and the gene was found to possess seven introns. The mature protein is 618 amino acids long with a calculated molecular weight of 67 212. Amino acid sequence alignments show that the enzyme belongs to family 51 of the glycosyl hydrolases, although it differs in some properties from other enzymes of this family. 
19502758	20090609	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of glycoside hydrolase family 6 enzymes from Coprinopsis cinerea.	Recombinants, Cel6 from Coprinopsis cinerea (CcCel6)A, -B, and -C, were expressed by Escherichia coli. These enzymes produced cellobiose from phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose. When Avicel was used as the substrate, CcCel6A showed higher activity toward the substrate than CcCel6B or -C. In reaction with carboxymethylcellulose, CcCel6B and -C hydrolyzed the substrate, whereas CcCel6A failed to react. 
11157256	20010207	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Expression of cmg1, an exo-beta-1,3-glucanase gene from Coniothyrium minitans, increases during sclerotial parasitism.	During sclerotial infection of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum the mycoparasite Coniothyrium minitans penetrates through the host cell wall, which contains beta-1,3-glucan as its major component. A PCR-based strategy was used to clone a beta-1,3-glucanase-encoding gene, designated cmg1, from a cDNA library of the fungus. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of this gene showed high levels of similarity to the sequences of other fungal exo-beta-1,3-glucanase genes. The calculated molecular mass of the deduced protein (without the predicted 24-amino-acid N-terminal secretion signal peptide) was 83,346 Da, and the estimated pI was 4.73. Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1 expressing the cmg1 gene secreted a approximately 100-kDa beta-1,3-glucanase enzyme (as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) into the culture medium. N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified recombinant enzyme revealed that the secreted enzyme starts at Ala-32, seven amino acids downstream from the predicted signal peptidase cleavage site. The purified recombinant glucanase inhibited in vitro mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum by 35 and 85% at concentrations of 300 and 600 microg x ml(-1), respectively. A single copy of the cmg1 gene is present in the genome of C. minitans. Northern analyses indicated increases in the transcript levels of cmg1 due to both carbon starvation and the presence of ground sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum; only slight repression was observed in the presence of 2% glucose. Expression of cmg1 increased during parasitic interaction with S. sclerotiorum. 
16328626	20051206	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of the CaENG1 gene encoding an endo-1,3-beta-glucanase involved in cell separation in Candida albicans.	The Candida albicans CaENG1 gene encoding an endo-1,3-beta-glucanase was cloned by screening a genomic library with a DNA probe obtained by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotides designed according to conserved regions found between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae endo-1,3-beta-glucanases (Eng1p and Eng2p). The gene contains a 3435-bp open reading frame (ORF), capable of encoding a protein of 1145 amino acids (124,157 Da), that contains no introns. Comparison of the ScEng1p sequence with partial C. albicans genomic sequences revealed the presence of a second protein with sequence similarity (the product of the Ca20C1.22c ORF, which was named CaENG2). Disruption of the CaENG1 gene in C. albicans had no dramatic effects on the growth rate of the strains, but it resulted in the formation of chains of cells, suggesting that the protein is involved in cell separation. Expression of CaENG1 in S. cerevisiae cells afforded a 12-fold increase in the 1,3-beta-glucanase activity detected in culture supernatants, showing that the protein has similar enzymatic activity to that of the S. cerevisiae Eng1p. In addition, when the C. albicans protein was expressed under its native promoter in S. cerevisiae eng1 mutant cells, it was able to complement the separation defect of this mutant, indicating that these two proteins are true functional homologues. 
21653698	20110610	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Endo-beta-1,3-galactanase from winter mushroom Flammulina velutipes.	Arabinogalactan proteins are proteoglycans found on the cell surface and in the cell walls of higher plants. The carbohydrate moieties of most arabinogalactan proteins are composed of β-1,3-galactan main chains and β-1,6-galactan side chains, to which other auxiliary sugars are attached. For the present study, an endo-β-1,3-galactanase, designated FvEn3GAL, was first purified and cloned from winter mushroom Flammulina velutipes. The enzyme specifically hydrolyzed β-1,3-galactan, but did not act on β-1,3-glucan, β-1,3:1,4-glucan, xyloglucan, and agarose. It released various β-1,3-galactooligosaccharides together with Gal from β-1,3-galactohexaose in the early phase of the reaction, demonstrating that it acts on β-1,3-galactan in an endo-fashion. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that FvEn3GAL is member of a novel subgroup distinct from known glycoside hydrolases such as endo-β-1,3-glucanase and endo-β-1,3:1,4-glucanase in glycoside hydrolase family 16. Point mutations replacing the putative catalytic Glu residues conserved for enzymes in this family with Asp abolished activity. These results indicate that FvEn3GAL is a highly specific glycoside hydrolase 16 endo-β-1,3-galactanase. 
23129650	20121107	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Identification and treatment of heme depletion attributed to overexpression of a lineage of evolved P450 monooxygenases.	Recent advances in metabolic engineering have demonstrated that microbial biosynthesis can provide a viable alternative to chemical synthesis for the production of bulk and fine chemicals. Introduction of a new biosynthetic pathway typically requires the expression of multiple heterologous enzymes in the production host, which can impose stress on the host cell and, thereby, limit performance of the pathway. Unfortunately, analysis and treatment of the host stress response can be difficult, because there are many sources of stress that may interact in complex ways. We use a systems biological approach to analyze the stress imposed by expressing different enzyme variants from a lineage of soluble P450 monooxygenases, previously evolved for heterologous activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our analysis identifies patterns of stress imposed on the host by heterologous enzyme overexpression that are consistent across the evolutionary lineage, ultimately implicating heme depletion as the major stress. We show that the monooxygenase evolution, starting from conditions of either high or low stress, caused the cellular stress to converge to a common level. Overexpression of rate-limiting enzymes in the endogenous heme biosynthetic pathway alleviates the stress imposed by expression of the P450 monooxygenases and increases the enzymatic activity of the final evolved P450 by an additional 2.3-fold. Heme overexpression also increases the total activity of an endogenous cytosolic heme-containing catalase but not a heterologous P450 that is membrane-associated. This work demonstrates the utility of combining systems and synthetic biology to analyze and optimize heterologous enzyme expression.

A family 12 endoglucanase with a molecular mass of 23,926 Da (EG-II) from the brown-rot basidiomycete Fomitopsis palustris was purified and characterized. One of the roles of EG-II in wood degradation is thought to be to loosen the polysaccharide network in cell walls by disentangling hemicelluloses that are associated with cellulose. 
9153431	19970513	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 	Identification of the catalytic nucleophile of endoglucanase I from Fusarium oxysporum by mass spectrometry.	The endoglucanase EG I from Fusarium oxysporum catalyzes the hydrolysis of cellulose via a double-displacement mechanism involving the formation and hydrolysis of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Treatment of EG I with 2',4'-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-cellobioside results in the time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme (k(i) = 1.36 min(-1), Ki = 0.88 mM) via trapping of a covalent 2-deoxy-2-fluorocellobiosyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate is, however, catalytically competent undergoing transglycosylation, thus reactivation, in the presence of D-cellobiose. Analysis of a peptic digest of the inactivated enzyme by HPLC/ESMS/MS in the neutral loss mode allowed identification of a 2-fluorocellobiosyl-labeled peptide containing Glu197. This was confirmed by comparative mapping studies and subsequent Edman degradation analysis. This residue is completely conserved in glycosidase family 7, to which EG I belongs, consistent with its key role as the catalytic nucleophile. 
8358833	19930701	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterisation of an Aspergillus niger invertase and its DNA sequence.	A secreted invertase was purified 23-fold by ultrafiltration, ion-exchange, and gel filtration chromatography from the culture supernatant of 18 h sucrose-grown cultures of Aspergillus niger. The purified enzyme hydrolysed sucrose and raffinose but there was no detectable hydrolysis of inulin, melezitose or PNPG. Invertase activity was optimal at pH 5.5 and 50 degrees C. The molecular mass of reduced invertase was 115 kDa, as determined by SDS gel electrophoresis. The native molecular weight of between 225 kDa and 250 kDa, estimated by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, suggests that the protein is a dimer of identical subunits. The suc1 gene encoding this protein was completely-sequenced. The translated sequence yields a protein of 566 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 61 kDa, suggesting that carbohydrates represent about 50% of the mass of the protein.

Secretion of endo-1,5-alpha-L-arabinase A (ABN A) by an Aspergillus niger xylulose kinase mutant upon mycelium transfer to medium containing L-arabitol was immunochemically followed with time to monitor its induction profile. A cDNA expression library was made from polyA+ RNA isolated from the induced mycelium. This library was immunochemically screened and one ABN A specific clone emerged. The corresponding abnA gene was isolated from an A. niger genomic library. Upon Southern blot analysis, a 3.1-kb HindIII fragment was identified and subcloned to result in plasmid pIM950. By means of co-transformation using the A. niger pyrA gene as selection marker, the gene was introduced in both A. niger and A. nidulans uridine auxotrophic mutants. Prototrophic A. niger and A. nidulans transformants overproduced A. niger ABN A upon growth in medium containing sugar beet pulp as the sole carbon source, thereby establishing the identity and functionality of the cloned gene. The DNA sequence of the complete HindIII fragment was determined and the structure of the abnA gene as well as of its deduced gene product were analysed. Gene abnA contains three introns within its structural region and codes for a protein of 321 amino acids. Signal peptide processing results in a mature protein of 302 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 32.5 kDa. A. niger abnA is the first gene encoding an ABN to be isolated and characterized. 
12850270	20030710	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 	Cel6A, a major exoglucanase from the cellulosome of the anaerobic fungi Piromyces sp. E2 and Piromyces equi.	Anaerobic fungi possess high cellulolytic activities, which are organised in high molecular mass (HMM) complexes. Besides catalytic modules, the cellulolytic enzyme components of these complexes contain non-catalytic modules, known as dockerins, that play a key role in complex assembly. Screening of a genomic and a cDNA library of two Piromyces species resulted in the isolation of two clones containing inserts of 5.5 kb (Piromyces sp. E2) and 1.5 kb (Piromyces equi). Both clones contained the complete coding region of a glycoside hydrolase (GH) from family 6, consisting of a 20 amino acid signal peptide, a 76 (sp. E2)/81 (P. equi) amino acid stretch comprising two fungal non-catalytic docking domains (NCDDs), a 24 (sp. E2)/16 (P. equi) amino acid linker, and a 369 amino acid catalytic module. Homology modelling of the catalytic module strongly suggests that the Piromyces enzymes will be processive cellobiohydrolases. The catalytic residues and all nearby residues are conserved. The reaction is thus expected to proceed via a classical single-displacement (inverting) mechanism that is characteristic of this family of GHs. The enzyme, defined as Cel6A, encoded by the full-length Piromyces E2 sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein expressed had a molecular mass of 55 kDa and showed activity against Avicel, supporting the observed relationship of the sequence to those of known cellobiohydrolases. Affinity-purified cellulosomes of Piromyces sp. E2 were analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) electrophoresis. A major band was detected with the molecular weight of Cel6A. A tryptic fingerprint of this protein confirmed its identity.

Endoglucanase gene egIV was cloned from Trichoderma viride AS 3.3711, an important cellulose-producing fungus, by using an RT-PCR protocol. The egIV cDNA is 1,297 bp in length and contains a 1,035 bp open reading frame encoding a 344 amino acid protein with an estimated molecular mass of 35.5 kDa and isoelectronic point (pI) of 5.29. The expression of gene egIV in T. viride AS 3.3711 could be induced by sucrose, corn straw, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), or microcrystalline cellulose, but especially by CMC. The transcripts of egIV were regulated under these substrates, but the expression level of the egIV gene could be inhibited by glucose and fructose. Three recombinant vectors, pYES2-xegIV, pYES2Malpha-egIV, and pYES2Malpha-xegIV, were constructed to express the egIV gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae H158. The CMCase activity of yeast transformants IpYES2Malpha-xegIV was higher than that of transformant IpYES2-xegIV or IpYES2Malpha-egIV, with the highest activity of 0.13 U/ml at induction for 48 h, illustrating that the modified egIV gene could enhance CMCase activity and that MFalpha signal peptide from S. cerevisiae could regulate exogenous gene expression more effectively in S. cerevisiae. The recombinant EGIV enzyme was stable at pH 3.5 to 7.5 and temperature of 35 degrees C to 65 degrees C. The optimal reaction condition for EGIV enzyme activity was at the temperature of 55 degrees C, pH of 5.0, 0.75 mM Ba²⁺, and using CMC as substrate. Under these conditions, the highest activity of EGIV enzyme in transformant IpYES2Malpha-xegIV was 0.18 U/ml. These properties would provide technical parameters for utilizing cellulose in industrial bioethanol production. 
11997095	20020509	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 	A highly expressed family 1 beta-glucosidase with transglycosylation capacity from the anaerobic fungus Piromyces sp. E2.	Anaerobic fungi have very high cellulolytic activities and thus degrade cellulose very efficiently. In cellulose hydrolysis, beta-glucosidases play an important role in prevention of product inhibition because they convert oligosaccharides to glucose. A beta-glucosidase gene (cel1A) was isolated from a cDNA library of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces sp. E2. Sequence analysis revealed that the gene encodes a modular protein with a calculated mass of 75800 Da and a pI of 5.05. A secretion signal was followed by a negatively charged domain with unknown function. This domain was coupled with a short linker to a catalytic domain that showed high homology with glycosyl hydrolases belonging to family 1. Southern blot analysis revealed the multiplicity of the gene in the genome. Northern analysis showed that growth on fructose resulted in a high expression of cel1A. The cel1A gene was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. The purified heterologously expressed protein was shown to be encoded by the cel1A gene by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of a tryptic digest. Purified heterologous Cel1A was active towards several artificial and natural substrates with beta-1-4 linked glucose molecules with a remarkably high activity on cellodextrins. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by D-glucono-1,5-delta-lactone (K(i)=22 microM), but inhibition by glucose was much less (K(i)=9.5 mM). pH and temperature optimum were 6 and 39 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was fairly stable, retaining more than 75% of its activity when incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 weeks. Transglycosylation activity could be demonstrated by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of products formed during degradation of cellopentaose.

A gene encoding a thermo-stable endo-beta-1,4-glucanase was isolated from the thermophilic fungus, Thermoascus aurantiacus IFO9748, and designated as eg1. Induction of this gene expression at 50 degrees C was stronger than at 30 degrees C. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by eg1 showed that it belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 5. The cloned gene was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the gene product was purified and characterized. No significant activity loss was detected over 2 h at 70 degrees C and the product was stable from pH 3-10. The enzyme was optimally active at 70 degrees C over 20 min and the optimal pH was 6.

A 2.1-kb DNA fragment containing the SWA2 gene determining an alpha-amylase from Schwanniomyces occidentalis has been sequenced. It contains an open reading frame of 1521 bp which has the potential to encode a 507 amino-acid protein of M(r) 55966. Its deduced amino-acid sequence shows significant similarities to the sequence of other studied alpha-amylases. These similarities identify a consensus sequence, F(LIV)(ED)NHD, which is shared in addition by most maltases, invertases and glucoamylases.

Hydrolytic enzymes from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum have been described as critical elements of the mycoparasitic action of Trichoderma against fungal plant pathogens. In this report we describe the first genomic and cDNA clones encoding a beta-1,6-endoglucanase gene. The deduced protein sequence has limited homology with other beta-glucanases. Northern experiments show a marked repression of mRNA accumulation by glucose. The protein has been successfully produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon construction of a transcriptional fusion of the cDNA with a yeast promoter. This S. cerevisiae recombinant strain shows a strong lytic action on agar plates containing beta-1,6-glucan.

Production of extracellular a-galactosidases by the filamentous fungus Penicillium simplicissimum (previously P. janthinellum) VTT-D-78090 was studied on different carbon sources. Steam-exploded oat husks were chosen as the best carbon source for enzyme production. Three a-galactosidases (AGL) were purified from the culture filtrate using ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration. The isoelectric points of AGLI, AGLII and AGLIII were 5.2, 4.4 and 7.0, and the molecular masses as determined by SDS/PAGE were 61, 84 and 61 kDa, respectively. All enzymes were glycosylated. The optimum pH for the activity of AGLI and AGLIII was between 3.0 and 4.5 and that of AGLII was between 4.0 and 5.0. AGLII was more stable and more resistant to product inhibition by galactose than the other two enzymes. AGLI and AGLIII were also inhibited by p-nitrophenol-a-D-galactopyranoside, the substrate used for enzyme activity assay. The gene encoding AGLI was cloned and sequenced. The gene, agl1, encodes 435 amino acids including the signal sequence. It showed similarity with the other a-galactosidases belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 27. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of AGLIII was also similar to the sequences of other members of family 27, whereas the N-terminus of AGLII was completely different from the sequences of other reported hydrolases. 
18072936	20071213	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	A xyloglucan-specific family 12 glycosyl hydrolase from Aspergillus niger: recombinant expression, purification and characterization.	A new GH12 (glycosyl hydrolase 12) family XEG [xyloglucan-specific endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.151)] from Aspergillus niger, AnXEG12A, was overexpressed, purified and characterized. Whereas seven xyloglucanases from GH74 and two xyloglucanases from GH5 have been characterized previously, this is only the third characterized example of a GH12 family xyloglucanase. GH12 enzymes are structurally and mechanistically distinct from GH74 enzymes. Although over 100 GH12 sequences are now available, little is known about the structural and biochemical bases of xyloglucan binding and hydrolysis by GH12 enzymes. Comparison of the AnXEG12A cDNA sequence with the genome sequence of A. niger showed the presence of two introns, one in the coding region and the second one in the 333-nt-long 3'-untranslated region of the transcript. The enzyme was expressed recombinantly in A. niger and was readily purified from the culture supernatant. The isolated enzyme appeared to have been processed by a kexin-type protease, which removed a short prosequence. The substrate specificity was restricted to xyloglucan, with cleavage at unbranched glucose in the backbone. The apparent kinetic parameters were similar to those reported for other xyloglucan-degrading endoglucanases. The pH optimum (5.0) and temperature resulting in highest enzyme activity (50-60 degrees C) were higher than those reported for a GH12 family xyloglucanase from Aspergillus aculeatus, but similar to those of cellulose-specific endoglucanases from the GH12 family. Phylogenetic, sequence and structural comparisons of GH12 family endoglucanases helped to delineate features that appear to be correlated to xyloglucan specificity.

8688436	19960709	Biochemistry	D016428 D013486 D013487 	Characterization of manganese(II) binding site mutants of manganese peroxidase.	A series of site-directed mutants, E35Q, E39Q, and E35Q-D179N, in the gene encoding manganese peroxidase isozyme 1 (mnp1) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium, was created by overlap extension, using the polymerase chain reaction. The mutant genes were expressed in P. chrysosporium during primary metabolic growth under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. The mutant manganese peroxidases (MnPs) were purified and characterized. The molecular masses of the mutant proteins, as well as UV-vis spectral features of their oxidized states, were very similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. Resonance Raman spectral results indicated that the heme environment of the mutant MnP proteins also was similar to that of the wild-type protein. Steady-state kinetic analyses of the E35Q and E39Q mutant MnPs yielded K(m) values for the substrate MnII that were approximately 50-fold greater than the corresponding K(m) value for the wild-type enzyme. Likewise, the kcat values for MnII oxidation were approximately 300-fold lower than that for wild-type MnP. With the E35Q-D179N double mutant, the K(m) value for MnII was approximately 120-fold greater, and the kcat value was approximately 1000-fold less than that for the wild-type MnP1. Transient-state kinetic analysis of the reduction of MnP compound II by MnII allowed the determination of the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) and first- order rate constants for the mutant proteins. The KD values were approximately 100-fold higher for the single mutants and approximately 200-fold higher for the double mutant, as compared with the wild-type enzyme. The first-order rate constants for the single and double mutants were approximately 200-fold and approximately 4000-fold less, respectively, than that of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the K(m) values for H2O2 and the rates of compound I formation were similar for the mutant and wild-type MnPs. The second-order rate constants for p-cresol and ferrocyanide reduction of the mutant compounds II also were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. 
8437	19760501	J._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and properties of an endo-cellulase of avicelase type from Irpex lacteus (Polyporus tulipiferae).	A culture filtrate of Irpex lacteus (Polyporus tulipiferae) was fractionated initially by salting out with ammonium sulfate, and a cellulase [EC 3.2.1.4.] fraction with high Avicel-hydrolyzing activity (formerly called Avicelase) was extensively purified by a series of column chromatography procedures. This purified endo-cellulase showed a less random hydrolytic mechanism, and was obtained in a yield of 0.04% with respect to the starting material. Its specific activity was enhanced approximately 30 times over that of the starting material. The cellulase component showed a single peak on both ultracentrifugal and acrylamide disc electrophoretic analyses. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 56,000. It contained 12.2% carbohydrate; the major sugar constituents were glucose and mannose. Regarding the amino acid composition, the contents of aspartic acid and glycine were highest, followed by those of glutamic acid, serine, and theonine. The cellulase component was not markedly inhibited by most metal ions tested excepted for Hg2+. This purified endo-cellulase attacked a series of cellooligosaccharides, beta-cellobioside, CM-cellulose, and insoluble, cellulosic substrates. In the digests from insoluble substrates, glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, and cellotetraose were detectable, but the amount of cellobiose was the largest by far. In constrast, cellobiose and glucose were produced in almost equal amounts from beta-cellobioside. 
12073090	20020620	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Cloning and relational analysis of 15 novel fungal endoglucanases from family 12 glycosyl hydrolase.	Cellulases belong to the large family of glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) and are produced by a variety of bacteria and fungi. These extracellular enzymes act as endoglucanases (EGs), cellobiohydrolases or beta-glucosidases. In this paper, we describe molecular screening for EGs from the GH family 12. Using three homologous sequence boxes deduced from five previously known members of the family, we analysed 22 cellulase-producing fungal strains obtained from a diverse area of the fungal kingdom. Polymerase chain reactions using degenerate primers designed to the homologous protein boxes were used to identify the family 12 homologues. Several fungi showed the presence of multiple versions of the gene, while amino acid sequence analysis showed diversity in 15 novel members of the family, ranging from 26% to 96% similarity. Our sequence analysis shows that the phylogenetic tree of family 12 EGs can be divided into four subfamilies: 12-1 (fungal group I), 12-2 (fungal group II), 12-3 ( Streptomyces group in which Rhodothermus marinus fits) and 12-4 ( Thermophiles group). Erwinia carotovora may form a new subgroup. 
10682284	20000222	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and enzymatic characterization of a Trichoderma reesei 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidase.	A cDNA encoding 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidase mds 1 from Trichoderma reesei was cloned. The largest open reading frame occupied 1571 bp. The predicted sequence contains 523 amino acid residues for a calculated molecular mass of 56,266 Da and shows high similarity to the amino acid sequences of 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidases from Aspergillus saitoi and Penicillium citrinum (51.6 and 51.0% identity, respectively). T. reesei mannosidase was produced as a recombinant enzyme in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Replacement of the N-terminal part with the prepro-signal peptide of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-mating factor resulted in high amounts of secreted enzyme. A three-step purification protocol was designed and the enzymatic properties were analyzed. The enzyme was characterized as a class-I mannosidase. 
9335167	19971023	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Enzymatic properties of cellulases from Humicola insolens.	We present the analysis of the activities towards soluble and insoluble substrates of seven cellulases cloned from the saprophytic fungus Humicola insolens. The activity on the soluble polymer substrate carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was used to determine the pH activity profiles of the five endoglucanases (EG), whereas cellotriose and reduced cellohexaose were used to determine the pH activity profiles of cellobiohydrolase I (CBH) and CBH II. All the EGs show optimal activity between pH 7 and 8.5, while CBH I and CBH II peak around pH 5.5 and 9, respectively. The catalytic activities of five of these cellulases were investigated under neutral and alkaline conditions using reduced cellohexaose as a substrate in a cellobiose oxidase coupled assay. EG I and CBH I both belong to family (7) according to a recent classification of glycosyl hydrolases. They both have activity against cellotriose. Therefore, they were studied using a coupled assay involving glucose oxidase. The activity on insoluble substrate (phosphoric-acid swollen cellulose) was assessed by the formation of reducing groups. The presence of a cellulose binding domain (CBD) lowers the apparent KM. This can be explained by the dispersing action of CBD. However, the CBD also reduces the apparent k(cat) probably by slowing down the mobility. EG I, EG II and EG III show similar activity towards CMC and amorphous cellulose, while EG V, EG VI, CBH I and CBH II have the highest catalytic rate on amorphous cellulose. In summary, Humicola insolens possesses a battery of cellulose-degrading enzymes which cooperate in the efficient hydrolysis of cellulose. 
2227420	19900901	Gene	D016428 D013486 	Characterization of a gene encoding a manganese peroxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	The complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of a gene (mnp-1) encoding manganese peroxidase isozyme 1 (MnP-1) (pI = 4.9) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been determined. The sequence of 2539 bp includes 526 bp of 5'-flanking sequence and 368 bp 3' to the poly(A) site. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences indicates six introns varying in size from 57-72 bp. Intron splice-junction sequences all adhere to the GT---AG rule. The positions of the introns show little similarity to the intron positions in the closely related lignin peroxidase-encoding genes. The 5' upstream region of the mnp-1 gene contains a TATAA element and three inverted CCAAT elements (ATTGG) at nt positions -81, -181, -195, and -304, respectively, relative to the start codon. In addition, the mnp-1 gene contains three putative heat-shock (HS) elements similar to the consensus C--GAA--TTC--G sequence, and two consensus metal response elements located within 500 bp upstream from the start codon. Furthermore, Northern-blot analysis demonstrates that mnp gene transcription is regulated by HS. 
1979298	19901030	Gene	D003160 D016428 	Cloning of the Schwanniomyces occidentalis glucoamylase gene (GAM1) and its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	The Schwanniomyces occidentalis glucoamylase (GAM)-encoding gene (GAM1) was isolated from a lambda Charon4A genomic library using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides as probes. GAM1 contains an ORF of 2874 nucleotides (nt) coding for 958 amino acids. S1 mapping revealed that the transcript has only a very short 5'-untranslated leader of 8-12 nt. Disruption and displacement of the GAM1 gene in Sc. occidentalis resulted in loss of the ability to grow on starch efficiently. The gam1 strains still exhibit low GAM activity suggesting that at least a second weakly expressed GAM-encoding gene (GAM2) is present in Sc. occidentalis. Expression of the Sc. occidentalis GAM1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was achieved after promoter exchange. S. cerevisiae cells transformed with centromere plasmids carrying the GAM1 gene fused to promoters of different S. cerevisiae genes, namely GAL1, PDC1 and ADH1, efficiently secrete GAM and are able to grow with soluble starch as a sole carbon source. The essential enzymatic properties of the GAMs secreted from S. cerevisiae and Sc. occidentalis are identical, although the modifications of the proteins are different. 
21626020	20110601	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Biochemical characterization of Magnaporthe oryzae β-glucosidases for efficient β-glucan hydrolysis.	β-Glucosidases designated MoCel3A and MoCel3B were successfully overexpressed in Magnaporthe oryzae. MoCel3A and MoCel3B showed optimal activity at 50 °C and pH 5.0-5.5. MoCel3A exhibited higher activity on higher degree of polymerization (DP) oligosaccharides and on β-1,3-linked oligosaccharides than on β-1,4-linked oligosaccharides. Furthermore, MoCel3A could liberate glucose from polysaccharides such as laminarin, 1,3-1,4-β-glucan, phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose, and pustulan, of which laminarin was the most suitable substrate. Conversely, MoCel3B preferentially hydrolyzed lower DP oligosaccharides such as cellobiose, cellotriose, and laminaribiose. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of combining enzymes including MoCel3A and MoCel3B were investigated. Depolymerization of 1,3-1,4-β-glucan by M. oryzae cellobiohydrolase (MoCel6A) enhanced the production of glucose by the actions of MoCel3A and MoCel3B. In these reactions, MoCel3A hydrolyzed higher DP oligosaccharides, resulting in the release of glucose and cellobiose, and MoCel3B preferentially hydrolyzed lower DP oligosaccharides including cellobiose. On the other hand, MoCel3A alone produced glucose from laminarin at levels equivalent to 80% of maximal hydrolysis obtained by the combined action of MoCel3A, MoCel3B, and endo-1,3-β-glucanase. Therefore, MoCel3A and MoCel3B activities yield glucose from not only cellulosic materials but also hemicellulosic polysaccharides. 
11193399	20010224	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of an endoinulinase gene from Penicillium sp. strain TN-88.	A genomic DNA segment and cDNAs encoding an extracellular endoinulinase of Penicillium sp. strain TN-88 were cloned and sequenced. Southern blot analysis indicated that the endoinulinase gene (inuC) was present as a single copy in the genome. An open reading frame, consisting of 1,545 bp, was not interrupted by introns, and it encoded a 25 amino acid signal peptide and a 490 amino acid mature protein. The mature protein contained three Cys residues and ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Three distinct transcriptional start points were observed at positions -242 (A), -215 (A), and -75 (C) from the start codon. The 5'-noncoding region had a putative TATA box at position -120 (TATATATA) and two contiguous CAAT sequences at -159 to -151. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 72 and 85% identities with those of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium purpurogenum endoinulinase genes, respectively. A neighbor-joining tree showed that fungal endoinulinases form a distinct cluster from other members of the beta-fructofuranosidase superfamily and that they are more closely related to bacterial levanases than to a fungal fructosyltransferase, yeast invertases, or a yeast exoinulinase. 
1368837	19920801	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Cloning and molecular analysis of cDNA encoding a carboxymethylcellulase of the yeast Cryptococcus flavus.	A cDNA copy for carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase 1) of the yeast Cryptococcus flavus was cloned by screening an expression cDNA library with anti-CMCase 1 antibody. The sequence of the cDNA had an open reading frame of 1023 bp that encoded a preprotein of 341 amino acids with a molecular weight of 35,698. The putative precursor begins with a hydrophobic segment that possibly acts as a signal sequence for secretion, which is followed by a presumed prosequence and a sequence consistent with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of secreted CMCase 1. No potential N-glycosylation site was found in the sequence of putative pro-CMCase 1. Comparison of the deduced protein sequence shows that the C. flavus CMCase 1 is partially homologous to the Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase EGIII. Alignment of the cDNA copy and the chromosomal DNA showed seven putative introns of 45 to 134 bp. When introduced into E. coli, the cDNA directed the synthesis of CMCase 1 as seen by CMCase activity and Western blotting using anti-CMCase 1 antibody. 
9682473	19980731	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, molecular characterization, and expression of an endo-polygalacturonase-encoding gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae IM1-8b.	A structural polygalacturonase-encoding gene (PGU1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae IM1-8b was cloned and sequenced. The predicted protein comprises 361 amino acids, with a signal peptide between residues 1 and 18 and two potential glycosylation points in residues 318 and 330. The putative active site is a conserved histidine in position 222. This polygalacturonase showed 54% homology with the fungal ones and only 24% homology with their plant and bacterial counterparts. The gene is present in a single gene copy per haploid genome and it is detected in all strains, regardless of their phenotype. The expression of PGU1 gene in several strains of S. cerevisiae revealed that the polygalacturonase activity depended on the plasmid used and also on the genetic background of each strain but in all cases the enzymatic activity increased. 
16614858	20060415	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Unusual hydrophobic linker region of beta-glucosidase (BGLII) from Thermoascus aurantiacus is required for hyper-activation by organic solvents.	A gene encoding a putative beta-glucosidase was isolated from Thermoascus aurantiacus IFO9748 and designated as bgl2. The recombinant enzyme showed beta-glucosidase activity when p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucose (pNP-Glc) was used as substrate. We also found that the enzyme activity was increased in the presence of organic solvents. An addition of 20 % (v/v) 1-octanol resulted in 54-fold higher activity of pNP-Glc hydrolysis, and transglycosylation activity was also found to be activated. The results of tryptophan fluorescence spectral analysis revealed the changes in the tertiary structure of the enzyme in the presence of 1-hexanol that may cause increased enzyme activity. BGLII has a distinctive hydrophobic linker region between N- and C-terminal domains. A chimeric enzyme in which the linker region was substituted by the corresponding region of another beta-glucosidase failed to be activated by organic solvents, suggesting that the hydrophobic linker region may act as a molecular switch in BGLII. 
20070371	20100115	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 	Molecular characterization of lignin peroxidase from the white-rot basidiomycete Trametes cervina: a novel fungal peroxidase.	The lignin peroxidase (LiP) from Trametes cervina was cloned, characterized, and identified as a novel fungal peroxidase. The sequence of T. cervina LiP encodes the essential amino acids for shaping the heme cavity and calcium-binding sites, which are conserved in plant and fungal peroxidases. However, a sequence homology analysis showed that T. cervina LiP has two unique features: it lacks the conserved tryptophan residue corresponding to the substrate-oxidation site (Trp171) of Phanerochaete chrysosporium LiP and it has a tyrosine residue (Tyr181) that has never been reported in other lignin peroxidases. A tertiary model of T. cervina LiP showed that Tyr181 sterically adjacent to the 6-propionate group of heme is surrounded by acidic amino acids and is exposed to the exterior. These attributes indicate that Tyr181 could be a T. cervina LiP substrate-oxidation site. A phylogenetic analysis showed that T. cervina LiP does not cluster with any other fungal peroxidases, suggesting that it is a unique molecule that is evolutionarily distant from other peroxidases. Thus, we concluded that T. cervina LiP could be a novel secreted peroxidase, among those produced by fungi, with a new oxidation mechanism probably involving Tyr181.

The avi2 gene encoding Avi2, which is a major cellulase produced by Humicola insolens FERM BP-5977, was cloned and sequenced. Avi2 showed high homology with other family 6 cellulases. The expression vector pNCE4 containing the avi2 gene was constructed, and this strain was transformed using a protoplast method. As a result, the pNCE4 transformant secreted 8-fold more Avi2 than the recipient strain. 
10525153	19991019	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013486 	Characterization of genes encoding two manganese peroxidases from the lignin-degrading fungus Dichomitus squalens(1).	Genes encoding two manganese peroxidases from the white-rot basidiomycete Dichomitus squalens were cloned and sequenced. The mnp1 and mnp2 genes encode mature proteins of 369 and 365 amino acids, respectively. The amino acids involved in peroxidase function, those forming the Mn(II) binding site, and those forming the five disulfide bonds in other Mn peroxidases are conserved in these sequences. Both predicted D. squalens proteins contain multiple acidic residues in their C-terminal sequences, which may be involved in additional metal binding. Both genes contain seven small introns, the locations of which align with each other. The promoters of both D. squalens genes contain putative AP-2 sites, which may be involved in their regulation by nutrient nitrogen. Southern blot analysis of genomic PCR fragments suggests that these sequences represent separate genes rather than allelic variants. 
11255010	20010320	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Cloning of maltase gene from a methylotrophic yeast, Hansenula polymorpha.	The Hansenula polymorpha maltase structural gene (HPMAL1) was isolated from a genomic library by hybridization of the library clones with maltase-specific gene probe. An open reading frame of 1695 nt encoding a 564 amino-acid protein with calculated molecular weight of 65.3 kD was characterized in the genomic DNA insert of the plasmid p51. The protein sequence deduced from the HPMAL1 exhibited 58 and 47% identity with maltases from Candida albicans and Saccharomyces carlsbergesis encoded by CAMAL2 and MAL62, respectively, and 44% identity with oligo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase from Bacillus cereus. The recombinant Hansenula polymorpha maltase produced in Escherichia coli hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (PNPG), sucrose, maltose and alpha-methylglucoside and did not act on melibiose, cellobiose, trehalose and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG). The affinity of the recombinant enzyme for its substrates increased in the order maltose <alpha-methylglucoside <sucrose <PNPG. Southern analysis revealed presence of a single maltase gene in H. polymorpha. This is the first report on the maltase gene sequence from a methylotrophic yeast. 
20109094	20100130	Med._Mycol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning, characterization and expression analysis of two beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase homologs of Coccidioides posadasii.	Two full-length cDNAs were isolated from Coccidioides posadasii that encode two deduced proteins (CpHEX1 and CpHEX2) with homology to the glycosyl hydrolase 20 family of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases. CpHEX1 consists of 595 amino acids, has a predicted molecular mass of 68 kDa and shares the highest identity with the N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAGA) of Aspergillus nidulans, while CpHEX2 consists of 603 amino acids, has a predicted molecular mass of 68.5 kDa and shares the highest identity with NAG1 from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. CpHEX1 and CpHEX2 share only 23% identity and have dissimilar homologies showing more identity with other fungal beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases than with each other. Phylogenetic analysis of selected beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases placed CpHEX1 in a cluster with the orthologs from A. nidulans, Aspergillus oryzae, Penicillium chrysogenum and Candida albicans, while CpHEX2 grouped with the orthologs from P. brasiliensis and the Trichoderma spp. beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity and transcripts encoding CpHEX1 and CpHEX2 were detected in vitro during the spherule-endospore (SE) phase. Expression of the Cphex1 transcript exhibited a temporal increase that correlated with beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity, while the Cphex2 transcript remained relatively constant. The addition of N-acetylglucosamine to the cultures increased beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity and the expression of the Cphex1 transcript. A native beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase enzyme was purified from in vitro SE phase and identified as CpHEX1 by mass spectrometric analysis. Both the CpHEX1 and CpHEX2 cDNAs were expressed as recombinant fusion proteins and purified under denaturing conditions to apparent homogeneity but they lacked enzymatic activity. 
1369024	19921101	Biotechnology_(N.Y.)	D016428 D013485 	The two major xylanases from Trichoderma reesei: characterization of both enzymes and genes.	As a first step to exploit the potential of Trichoderma reesei to produce hemicellulases, we have purified two endo-beta-1,4-xylanases (1,4-beta-D-xylan xylanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.8) and cloned their genes. The enzymes were isolated from culture filtrates of T. reesei C30 grown on xylan as a carbon source, using two steps of cation exchange chromatography. They exhibited molecular weights of 19 (XYN I) and 21 (XYN II) kD, and isoelectric points of 5.2 and 9.0, respectively. These enzymes differed in their pH optimum for activity and affinity for xylan, and accounted for more than 90% of the total xylanolytic activity of the fungus. The purified enzymes were subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis, and after cleavage with trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C the resulting peptides were sequenced. Oligonucleotides based on these sequences were used to clone gene fragments via PCR, and these were used as probes to isolate full-length copies of xyn1 and xyn2 from a lambda gene bank of T. reesei. The products of xyn1 and xyn2 share considerable homology, but the enzyme encoded by xyn2 appears to more closely resemble several other bacterial and fungal xylanases than does that of xyn1. 
9128738	19970401	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	beta-Xylosidase activity, encoded by xlnD, is essential for complete hydrolysis of xylan by Aspergillus niger but not for induction of the xylanolytic enzyme spectrum.	Two proteins exhibiting beta-D-xylosidase activity were identified upon fractionation and purification of a culture filtrate of an arabinoxylan-grown Aspergillus niger. A single band of 110 kDa by SDS/PAGE was obtained in both cases and these were active on xylo-oligosaccharides and on xylan. Partial xlnD cDNA clones were immunochemically identified and isolated from a lambda cDNA expression library. Sequence analysis showed that all cDNA clones correspond to a single gene. A genomic clone was isolated and overexpressed in A. niger and A. nidulans. The xlnD gene has an ORF of 2412 nucleotides, encodes a protein of 804 amino acids and contains a potential signal peptide of 26 amino acids. This results in a mature protein of 778 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 85 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.5. The protein is N-glycosylated and contains 15 potential N-glycosylation sites. Sequence similarity is found with beta-D-glucosidases both of bacterial and fungal origin. Both beta-xylosidase proteins purified have high activity on the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xylopyranoside (XylNp) and a side activity on p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside. A niger strains in which the xlnD gene was disrupted accumulate mainly xylobiose and xylotriose when grown on xylan and have no significant beta-xylosidase activity in the culture medium, indicating that this gene encodes the major extracellular beta-xylosidase. 
10376824	19990622	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485 D013486 	A unique eukaryotic beta-xylosidase gene from the phytopathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum.	The plant-pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum secretes one major beta-xylosidase (Xyp1) when grown on xylan or maize cell walls. cDNA and genomic DNA encoding Xyp1 were isolated using PCR primers based on peptide sequences from the purified protein. XYP1 contains three introns, has 5' and 3' untranslated regions of 74 and 145 bp, respectively, and is predicted to encode a protein of 328 amino acids (Mr 36700) with four N-glycosylation sites. Although it is secreted, Xyp1 has no predicted signal peptide. Furthermore, Xyp1 appears not to be processed at the N-terminus because one of the peptides isolated from the mature protein is located only six amino acids downstream of the translational start methionine. The primary sequence of Xyp1 is unrelated to any known eukaryotic beta-xylosidase but has 35% overall identity to two bacterial bifunctional beta-xylosidase/alpha-arabinosidases. Mutation of XYP1 by targeted gene replacement resulted in the loss of the major beta-xylosidase activity corresponding to the product of XYP1, but a significant amount of secreted beta-xylosidase activity (25% of wild-type) remained in the culture filtrates. The xyp1 mutant was still fully pathogenic on maize. 
16776296	20060617	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of a novel invertase from the obligate biotroph Uromyces fabae and analysis of expression patterns of host and pathogen invertases in the course of infection.	Invertases are key enzymes in carbon partitioning in higher plants. They gain additional importance in the distribution of carbohydrates in the event of wounding or pathogen attack. Although many researchers have found an increase in invertase activity upon infection, only a few studies were able to determine whether the source of this activity was host or parasite. This article analyzes the role of invertases involved in the biotrophic interaction of the rust fungus Uromyces fabae and its host plant, Vicia faba. We have identified a fungal gene, Uf-INV1, with homology to invertases and assessed its contribution to pathogenesis. Expression analysis indicated that transcription began upon penetration of the fungus into the leaf, with high expression levels in haustoria. Heterologous expression of Uf-INV1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris allowed a biochemical characterization of the enzymatic activity associated with the secreted gene product INV1p. Expression analysis of the known vacuolar and cell-wall-bound invertase isoforms of V. faba indicated a decrease in the expression of a vacuolar invertase, whereas one cell-wall-associated invertase exhibited increased expression. These changes were not confined to the infected tissue, and effects also were observed in remote plant organs, such as roots. These findings hint at systemic effects of pathogen infection. Our results support the hypothesis that pathogen infection establishes new sinks which compete with physiological sink organs. 
19453169	20090521	J._Agric._Food_Chem.	D016428 D013485 	An acidophilic beta-galactosidase from Bispora sp. MEY-1 with high lactose hydrolytic activity under simulated gastric conditions.	BgalA, a full-length gene (3,009 bp) that encodes a beta-galactosidase, was cloned from the meso-acidophilic fungus Bispora sp. MEY-1 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The deduced amino acid sequence of BgalA shares highest identity (55.5%) with the beta-galactosidase from Aspergillus phoenicis, which belongs to the glycoside hydrolyase family 35. Purified recombinant BgalA is acidophilic, exhibiting maximum activity at pH 1.5, which is lower than that reported for other beta-galactosidases. The enzyme has high pH and thermal stability and is resistant to proteases and cations found in milk. The K(m) and V(max) of BgalA for 2-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside and lactose are 5.22 mM and 120.8 micromol/(min x mg), and 0.31 mM and 137.3 micromol/(min x mg), respectively. Under simulated gastric conditions, BgalA has greater stability ( approximately 100%) and hydrolysis ratio (>80%) toward milk lactose than the commercially available beta-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (ATCC 20423). Thus, BgalA may be a better digestive supplement for alleviating symptoms associated with lactase deficiency. 
15291818	20040805	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 	Val216 decides the substrate specificity of alpha-glucosidase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Differences in the substrate specificity of alpha-glucosidases should be due to the differences in the substrate binding and the catalytic domains of the enzymes. To elucidate such differences of enzymes hydrolyzing alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages, two alpha-glucosidases, maltase and isomaltase, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were cloned and analyzed. The cloned yeast isomaltase and maltase consisted of 589 and 584 amino acid residues, respectively. There was 72.1% sequence identity with 165 amino acid alterations between the two alpha-glucosidases. These two alpha-glucosidase genes were subcloned into the pKP1500 expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified alpha-glucosidases showed the same substrate specificities as those of their parent native glucosidases. Chimeric enzymes constructed from isomaltase by exchanging with maltase fragments were characterized by their substrate specificities. When the consensus region II, which is one of the four regions conserved in family 13 (alpha-amylase family), is replaced with the maltase type, the chimeric enzymes alter to hydrolyze maltose. Three amino acid residues in consensus region II were different in the two alpha-glucosidases. Thus, we modified Val216, Gly217, and Ser218 of isomaltase to the maltase-type amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis. The Val216 mutant was altered to hydrolyze both maltose and isomaltose but neither the Gly217 nor the Ser218 mutant changed their substrate specificity, indicating that Val216 is an important residue discriminating the alpha-1,4- and 1,6-glucosidic linkages of substrates. 
14523125	20031003	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485 D013487 	Disruption of the gene encoding the ChiB1 chitinase of Aspergillus fumigatus and characterization of a recombinant gene product.	The gene encoding a major, inducible 45 kDa chitinase of Aspergillus fumigatus was cloned and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence identified a chitinase of the fungal/bacterial class which was designated ChiB1. Recombinant ChiB1, expressed in Pichia pastoris, was shown to function by a retaining mechanism of action. That is, the beta-conformation of the chitin substrate linkage was preserved in the product in a manner typical of family 18 chitinases. Cleavage patterns with the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) oligosaccharide substrates GlcNAc(4), GlcNAc(5) and GlcNAc(6) indicated that the predominant reaction involved hydrolysis of GlcNAc(2) from the non-reducing end of each substrate. Products of transglycosylation were also identified in each incubation. Following disruption of chiB1 by gene replacement, growth and morphology of disruptants and of the wild-type strain were essentially identical. However, during the autolytic phase of batch cultures the level of chitinase activity in culture filtrate from a disruptant was much lower than the activity from the wild-type. The search for chitinases with morphogenetic roles in filamentous fungi should perhaps focus on chitinases of the fungal/plant class although such an investigation will be complicated by the identification of at least 11 putative active site domains for family 18 chitinases in the A. fumigatus TIGR database (http://www.tigr.org/).

D016428 D013485 	Cloning, expression, purification, and properties of an endoglucanase gene (glycosyl hydrolase family 12) from Aspergillus niger VTCC-F021 in Pichia pastoris.	A gene coding for an endoglucanase (EglA), of the glycosyl hydrolase family 12 and derived from Aspergillus niger VTCC-F021, was cloned and sequenced. The cDNA sequence, 717 bp, and its putative endoglucanase, a 238 aa protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26 kDa and a pI of 4.35, exhibited 98.3-98.7% and 98.3-98.6% identities, respectively, with cDNA sequences and their corresponding endoglucanases from Aspergillus niger strains from the GenBank. The cDNA was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 under the control of an AOX1 promoter with a level of 1.59 U/ml culture supernatant, after 72 h of growth in a YP medium induced with 1% (v/v) of methanol. The molecular mass of the purified EglA, determined by SDS-PAGE, was 33 kDa, with a specific activity of 100.16 and 19.91 U/mg toward 1% (w/v) of beta-glucan and CMC, respectively. Optimal enzymatic activity was noted at a temperature of 55°C and a pH of 5. The recombinant EglA (rEglA) was stable over a temperature range of 30- 37°C and at pH range of 3.5-4.5. Metal ions, detergents, and solvents tested indicated a slightly inhibitory effect on rEglA activity. Kinetic constants (K(m), V(max), k(cat), and k(cat)/ K(m)) determined for rEglA with beta-glucan as a substrate were 4.04 mg/ml, 102.04 U/mg, 2,040.82 min-1, and 505.05, whereas they were 10.17 mg/ml, 28.99 U/mg, 571.71 min-1, and 57.01 with CMC as a substrate, respectively. The results thus indicate that the rEglA obtained in this study is highly specific toward beta-glucan. The biochemical properties of rEglA make it highly valuable for downstream biotechnological applications, including potential use as a feed enzyme. 
12649442	20030322	Protein_Sci.	D003160 D016428 D013486 	Comparison of family 12 glycoside hydrolases and recruited substitutions important for thermal stability.	As part of a program to discover improved glycoside hydrolase family 12 (GH 12) endoglucanases, we have studied the biochemical diversity of several GH 12 homologs. The H. schweinitzii Cel12A enzyme differs from the T. reesei Cel12A enzyme by only 14 amino acids (93% sequence identity), but is much less thermally stable. The bacterial Cel12A enzyme from S. sp. 11AG8 shares only 28% sequence identity to the T. reesei enzyme, and is much more thermally stable. Each of the 14 sequence differences from H. schweinitzii Cel12A were introduced in T. reesei Cel12A to determine the effect of these amino acid substitutions on enzyme stability. Several of the T. reesei Cel12A variants were found to have increased stability, and the differences in apparent midpoint of thermal denaturation (T(m)) ranged from a 2.5 degrees C increase to a 4.0 degrees C decrease. The least stable recruitment from H. schweinitzii Cel12A was A35S. Consequently, the A35V substitution was recruited from the more stable S. sp. 11AG8 Cel12A and this T. reesei Cel12A variant was found to have a T(m) 7.7 degrees C higher than wild type. Thus, the buried residue at position 35 was shown to be of critical importance for thermal stability in this structural family. There was a ninefold range in the specific activities of the Cel12 homologs on o-NPC. The most and least stable T. reesei Cel12A variants, A35V and A35S, respectively, were fully active. Because of their thermal tolerance, S. sp. 11AG8 Cel12A and T. reesei Cel12A variant A35V showed a continual increase in activity over the temperature range of 25 degrees C to 60 degrees C, whereas the less stable enzymes T. reesei Cel12A wild type and the destabilized A35S variant, and H. schweinitzii Cel12A showed a decrease in activity at the highest temperatures. The crystal structures of the H. schweinitzii, S. sp. 11AG8, and T. reesei A35V Cel12A enzymes have been determined and compared with the wild-type T. reesei Cel12A enzyme. All of the structures have similar Calpha traces, but provide detailed insight into the nature of the stability differences. These results are an example of the power of homolog recruitment as a method for identifying residues important for stability. 
10671536	20000215	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, expression, characterization, and nucleophile identification of family 3, Aspergillus niger beta-glucosidase.	The beta-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger (CMI CC 324262) was purified, and an N-terminal sequence and two internal sequences were determined. BglI genomic gene and the cDNA were cloned from a genomic library and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The cDNA was successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. Sequence analysis revealed that the gene encodes a 92-kDa enzyme that is a member of glycosidase family 3. (1)H-NMR analysis of the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme confirmed that, in common with other family 3 glycosidases, this enzyme hydrolyzes with net retention of anomeric configuration. Accordingly, the enzyme was inactivated by 2-deoxy-2-fluoro beta-glucosyl fluoride, with kinetic parameters of k(i) = 4.5 min(-1), K(I) = 35.4 mM, through the trapping of a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate. The catalytic competence of this intermediate was demonstrated by the fact that incubation with linamarin resulted in reactivation, presumably via a transglycosylation mechanism. Peptic digestion of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucosyl enzyme and subsequent analysis of high pressure liquid chromatography eluates by electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in the neutral loss mode allowed the localization of a 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucosyl-peptide. Sequence determination of this labeled peptide by tandem mass spectrometry in the daughter ion scan mode permitted the identification of Asp-261 as the catalytic nucleophile within the sequence VMSDW. Asp-261 is fully conserved within this family, consistent with its key role, and aligns with the aspartic acid residue previously identified in the Aspergillus wentii enzyme by labeling with conduritol B epoxide (Bause, E., and Legler, G. (1974) Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 355, 438-442). 
2070799	19910715	Eur._J._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Kluyveromyces lactis toxin has an essential chitinase activity.	The Kluyveromyces lactis toxin is a protein containing three subunits (alpha, beta and gamma) which causes sensitive yeast cells to arrest proliferation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Despite the toxin's complex structure, the gamma subunit appears to be the only component required for it to arrest proliferation since intracellular expression of the gamma polypeptide alone in a sensitive yeast strain mimics the effect of the exogenous native toxin. The toxin alpha subunit shows sequence similarity to a variety of chitinases and here we report that the toxin is a potent exochitinase. The exochitinase activity is absolutely required for its biological activity against sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and allosamidin, a specific inhibitor of chitinases, abolishes the biological activity of the toxin. However, since the alpha subunit is not required for the G1 arrest induced by the toxin, the chitinase activity of the toxin cannot be directly responsible for the ultimate effect of the toxin and most likely plays a role in the initial interaction of the toxin with sensitive cells. 
9406391	19971224	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Two cellulases, CelA and CelC, from the polycentric anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces strain PC-2 contain N-terminal docking domains for a cellulase-hemicellulase complex.	Two cDNAs encoding two cellulases, CelA and CelC, were isolated from a cDNA library of the polycentric anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2 constructed in Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the celA cDNA (1,558 bp) and celC cDNA (1,628 bp) had open reading frames encoding polypeptides of 459 (CelA) and 449 (CelC) amino acids, respectively. The two cDNAs were 76.9 and 67.7% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that starting from the N termini, both CelA and CelC had signal peptides, which were followed by noncatalytic repeated peptide domains (NCRPD) containing two repeated sequences of 33 to 40 amino acid residues functioning as docking domains. The NCRPDs and the catalytic domains were separated by linker sequences. The NCRPDs were homologous to those found in several hydrolases of anaerobic fungi, whereas the catalytic domains were homologous to the catalytic domains of fungal cellobiohydrolases and bacterial endoglucanases. The linker sequence of CelA contained predominantly glutamine and proline residues, while that of CelC contained mainly threonine residues. CelA and CelC did not have a typical cellulose binding domain (CBD). CelA and CelC expressed in E. coli rapidly decreased the viscosity of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), indicating that there was endoglucanase activity. In addition, they produced cellobiose from CMC, acid-swollen cellulose, and cellotetraose, suggesting that they had cellobiohydrolase activity. The optimal activity conditions with CMC as the substrate were pH 4.3 to 6.8 and 50 degrees C for CelA and pH 4.6 to 7.0 and 40 degrees C for CelC. Despite the lack of a CBD, CelC displayed a high affinity for microcrystalline cellulose, whereas CelA did not.

During the screening of xylanolytic enzymes from locally isolated fungi, one strain BCC14405, exhibited high enzyme activity with thermostability. This fugal strain was identified as Aspergillus cf. niger based on its morphological characteristics and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. An enzyme with xylanolytic activity from BCC14405 was later purified and characterized. It was found to have a molecular mass of ca. 21 kDa, an optimal pH of 5.0, and an optimal temperature of 55 degrees C. When tested using xylan from birchwood, it showed K(m) and V(max) values of 8.9 mg/ml and 11,100 U/mg, respectively. The enzyme was inhibited by CuSO(4) EDTA, and by FeSO(4) The homology of the 20-residue N-terminal protein sequence showed that the enzyme was an endo-1,4-beta-xylanase. The full-length gene encoding endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from BCC14405 was obtained by PCR amplification of its cDNA. The gene contained an open reading frame of 678 bp, encoding a 225 amino acid protein, which was identical to the endo-1,4-a-xylanase B previously identified in A. niger. 
9805384	19981107	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, sequencing, and expression of an endoglucanase gene from the rumen anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix frontalis MCH3.	A cDNA clone encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from a rumen fungus, Neocallimastix frontalis MCH3, was isolated. The nucleotide sequence showed that the gene, celA, encoded a multidomain enzyme containing a family 5 catalytic domain and a reiterated sequence that is involved in the association of a multienzyme complex, the cellulosome. The enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli showed the highest activity against carboxymethylcellulose at 40 degrees C and pH 8.5. 
16232837	20051020	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Molecular cloning and high-level expression in Escherichia coli of fungal alpha-galactosidase from Absidia corymbifera IFO 8084.	A cDNA encoding the alpha-galactosidase of Absidia corymbifera IFO 8084 was cloned and sequenced. The cloned DNA has a single open-reading frame consisting of 2190 base pairs, and the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the mature enzyme consisted of 730 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 82,712 Da. The native structure of the alpha-galactosidase of A. corymbifera IFO 8084 was determined to be a tetramer. Comparison with amino acid sequences of other alpha-galactosidase showed high homology with sequences of members of family 36. An expression vector, pET32Trx/galalpha, was constructed by introducing the cDNA coding region into a thioredoxin fusion system, pET32-Ek/LIC. The resulting transformant, pET32Trx/galalpha, overproduced the active enzyme as a thioredoxin fused form in the host Escherichia coli. By using His-binding metal affinity chromatography, recombinant alpha-galactosidase was purified to homogeneity in a single step. The purified recombinant fusion alpha-galactosidase showed properties very similar to the native alpha-galactosidase from A. corymbifera IFO 8084. 
8522511	19951201	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013486 	Cloning of a novel constitutively expressed pectate lyase gene pelB from Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi (Nectria haematococca, mating type VI) and characterization of the gene product expressed in Pichia pastoris.	Since plant-pathogenic fungi must penetrate through pectinaceous layers of the host cell wall, pectin-degrading enzymes are thought to be important for pathogenesis. Antibodies prepared against a pectin-inducible pectate lyase (pectate lyase A [PLA]) produced by a phytopathogenic fungus, Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi (Nectria haematococca, mating type VI), was previously found to protect the host from infection. The gene (pelA) and its cDNA were cloned and sequenced. Here we report the isolation of a new pectate lyase gene, pelB, from a genomic library of F. solani f. sp. pisi with the pelA cDNA as the probe. A 2.6-kb DNA fragment containing pelB and its flanking regions was sequenced. The coding region of pelB was amplified by reverse transcription-mediated PCR, using total RNA isolated from F. solani pisi culture grown in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source. The predicted open reading frame of pelB would encode a 25.6-kDa protein of 244 amino acids which has 65% amino acid sequence identity with PLA from F. solani f. sp. pisi but no significant homology with other pectinolytic enzymes. The first 16 amino acid residues at the N terminus appeared to be a signal peptide. The pelB cDNA was expressed in Pichia pastoris, yielding a pectate lyase B (PLB) which was found to be a glycoprotein of 29 kDa. PLB was purified to homogeneity by using a two-step procedure involving ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Superdex G75 gel filtration chromatography. Purified PLB showed optimal lyase activity at pH 10.0. A rapid drop in the viscosity of the substrate and Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography of the products generated by the lyase showed that PLB cleaved polygalacturonate chains in an endo fashion. Western blotting (immunoblotting) with antibodies raised against PLA showed that PLB and PLA are immunologically related to each other. The 5' flanking regions of both pelA and pelB were translationally fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene and introduced into F. solani f. sp. pisi, and beta-glucuronidase activities of the transformants were measured. Expression of the marker gene by the transformants showed that pelA expression is induced by pectin and repressed by glucose, whereas expression of pelB is constitutive and is not subject to glucose repression. Reverse transcription-mediated PCR showed that both pelA and pelB are expressed when F. solani f. sp. pisi infects pea epicotyl. 
20645085	20100721	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	High-level expression of a specific beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from the thermophilic fungus Paecilomyces thermophila in Pichia pastoris.	In this study, a novel beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase gene (designated as PtLic16A) from Paecilomyces thermophila was cloned and sequenced. PtLic16A has an open reading frame of 945 bp, encoding 314 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence shares the highest identity (61%) with the putative endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase from Neosartorya fischeri NRRL 181. PtLic16A was cloned into a vector pPIC9K and was expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris as active extracellular beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase. The recombinant beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase (PtLic16A) was secreted predominantly into the medium which comprised up to 85% of the total extracellular proteins and reached a protein concentration of 9.1 g l(-1) with an activity of 55,300 U ml(-1) in 5-l fermentor culture. The enzyme was then purified using two steps, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 38.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE. It was optimally active at pH 7.0 and a temperature of 70 degrees C. Furthermore, the enzyme exhibited strict specificity for beta-1,3-1,4-D: -glucans. This is the first report on the cloning and expression of a beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase gene from Paecilomyces sp.

15580593	20041208	Yeast	D016428 D013485 	Development of a semi-quantitative plate-based alpha-galactosidase gene reporter for Schizosaccharomyces pombe and its use to isolate a constitutively active Mam2.	To extend the tools available for biochemical and genetical analysis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe we have investigated the development of gene reporter systems using the secreted alpha-galactosidase encoded by the Sz. pombe ORF SPAC869.07c (CAB60017), which we propose naming Mel1p to reflect its structural and functional similarity to MEL1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The alpha-galactosidase activity can be monitored in liquid assays and converted the colourless substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (X-alpha-gal) into an insoluble blue product that was suitable for semi quantitative plate-based assays; colonies expressing the highest levels of alpha-galactosidase developed the most intense blue colour. Unlike assays based on beta-galactosidase, the Sz. pombe colonies develop the blue colouration under normal growth conditions, avoiding the need to replicate colonies to fresh plates for analysis. It is therefore suitable for screening large numbers of colonies. To illustrate the use of mel1 as a reporter we linked expression to the sxa2 gene promoter to provide a convenient readout for signalling through the pheromone response pathway. The sxa2 > mel1 strain identified constitutively active Mam2 pheromone receptors from a randomly mutagenised library. There was an approximate correlation between the intensity of the blue colour developed by each mutant colony and its level of constitutive activity and we identified a subset of mutants with low constitutive activity that could not have been isolated by a previous screen using nutritional selection. The mel1 alpha-galactosidase activity identified and characterised in this study can be easily adapted to provide a gene reporter for many biological processes and is a new addition to the research tools available in Sz. pombe.

A novel β-glucosidase gene, bgl1G5, was cloned from Phialophora sp. G5 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. Sequence analysis indicated that the gene consists of a 1,431-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 476 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of bgl1G5 showed a high identity of 85% with a characterized β-glucosidase from Humicola grisea of glycoside hydrolase family 1. Compared with other fungal counterparts, Bgl1G5 showed similar optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 50 °C and was stable at pH 5.0-9.0. Moreover, Bgl1G5 exhibited good thermostability at 50 °C (6 h half-life) and higher specific activity (54.9 U mg⁻¹). The K (m) and V (max) values towards p-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) were 0.33 mM and 103.1 μmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹, respectively. The substrate specificity assay showed that Bgl1G5 was highly active against pNPG, weak on p-nitrophenyl β-D-cellobioside (pNPC) and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG), and had no activity on cellobiose. This result indicated Bgl1G5 was a typical aryl β-glucosidase. 
22080345	20111115	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	A family GH51 α-L-arabinofuranosidase from Pleurotus ostreatus: identification, recombinant expression and characterization.	An α-L-arabinofuranosidase produced by Pleurotus ostreatus (PoAbf) during solid state fermentation on tomato pomace was identified and the corresponding gene and cDNA were cloned and sequenced. Molecular analysis showed that the poabf gene carries 26 exons interrupted by 25 introns and has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 646 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 20 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence similar to the other α-L-arabinofuranosidases indicated that the enzyme encoded by poabf can be classified as a family 51 glycoside hydrolase. Heterologous recombinant expression of PoAbf was carried out in the yeasts Pichia pastoris and Kluyveromyces lactis achieving the highest production level of the secreted enzyme (180 mg L(-1)) in the former host. rPoAbf produced in P. pastoris was purified and characterized. It is a glycosylated monomer with a molecular weight of 81,500 Da in denaturing conditions. Mass spectral analyses led to the localization of a single O-glycosylation site at the level of Ser160. The enzyme is highly specific for α-L-arabinofuranosyl linkages and when assayed with p-nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside it follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K (M) of 0.64 mM and a k (cat) of 3,010 min(-1). The optimum pH is 5 and the optimal temperature 40°C. It is worth noting that the enzyme shows a very high stability in a broad range of pH. The more durable activity showed by rPoAbf in comparison to the other α-L-arabinofuranosidases enhances its potential for biotechnological applications and increases interest in elucidating the molecular bases of its peculiar properties. 
19507018	20090610	Biochem._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of a novel chitinase chi58 from Chaetomium cupreum in Pichia pastoris.	A gene encoding a novel chitinase chi58 was cloned from the fungus Chaetomium cupreum by using inverse PCR. The DNA sequence of chi58 contains a 1,602 bp open reading frame and two introns that are 52 and 201 bp in length. Regarding our in silico analysis, chi58 is a modular enzyme composed of a family-18 catalytic domain, which is responsible for chitinase activity, and a chitin-binding domain containing several cysteines. Apparently, the function of these domains is to anchor the enzyme tightly onto the large insoluble polymeric substrate. Chi58 has a pI of 4.47 and a deduced molecular mass of 58 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature conditions were determined to be 5.8 and 45 degrees C, respectively, when colloidal chitin was used as the substrate. SDS-PAGE and zymogram analyses indicated the presence of a single active chitinase. Cells with pPIC9K-chi58 produced an extracellular chitinase that had an activity of 39 U/ml protein. Metal ions such as Ba(2+), Mg(2+), K(+), Cu(2+), Fe(3+), Zn(2+), and Co(2+) also influenced the activity of the recombinant enzyme. 
23508952	20130320	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	SUN proteins belong to a novel family of β-(1,3)-glucan-modifying enzymes involved in fungal morphogenesis.	SUN proteins are involved in yeast morphogenesis, but their function is unknown. SUN protein plays a role in the Aspergillus fumigatus morphogenesis. Biochemical properties of recombinant SUN proteins were elucidated. Both Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus sun proteins show a β-(1,3)-glucanase activity. The mode of action of SUN proteins on β-(1,3)-glucan is unique, new, and original. In yeasts, the family of SUN proteins has been involved in cell wall biogenesis. Here, we report the characterization of SUN proteins in a filamentous fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus. The function of the two A. fumigatus SUN genes was investigated by combining reverse genetics and biochemistry. During conidial swelling and mycelial growth, the expression of AfSUN1 was strongly induced, whereas the expression of AfSUN2 was not detectable. Deletion of AfSUN1 negatively affected hyphal growth and conidiation. A closer examination of the morphological defects revealed swollen hyphae, leaky tips, intrahyphal growth, and double cell wall, suggesting that, like in yeast, AfSun1p is associated with cell wall biogenesis. In contrast to AfSUN1, deletion of AfSUN2 either in the parental strain or in the AfSUN1 single mutant strain did not affect colony and hyphal morphology. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant AfSun1p and Candida albicans Sun41p showed that both proteins had a unique hydrolysis pattern: acting on β-(1,3)-oligomers from dimer up to insoluble β-(1,3)-glucan. Referring to the CAZy database, it is clear that fungal SUN proteins represent a new family of glucan hydrolases (GH132) and play an important morphogenetic role in fungal cell wall biogenesis and septation.

D016428 D013485 D013486 	Properties of a recombinant beta-glucosidase from polycentric anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces PC-2 and its application for cellulose hydrolysis.	A beta-glucosidase (BglA, EC 3.2.1.21) gene from the polycentric anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces PC-2 was cloned and sequenced. The enzyme containing 657 amino acid residues was homologous to certain animal, plant, and bacterial beta-glucosidases but lacked significant similarity to those from aerobic fungi. Neither cellulose- nor protein-binding domains were found in BglA. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the enzyme was secreted in two forms with masses of about 110 kDa and also found in two forms associated with the yeast cells. Km and Vmax values of the secreted BglA were 0.762 mM and 8.20 micromol/(min x mg), respectively, with p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) as the substrate and 0.310 mM and 6.45 micromol/(min.mg), respectively, for the hydrolysis of cellobiose. Glucose competitively inhibited the hydrolysis of pNPG with a Ki of 3.6 mM. Beta-glucosidase significantly enhanced the conversion of cellulosic materials into glucose by Trichoderma reesei cellulase preparations, demonstrating its potential for use in biofuel and feedstock chemical production.

A cDNA fragment of the Anman5A, a gene that encodes an acidophilic β-mannanase of  Aspergillus niger  LW-1 (abbreviated as AnMan5A), was cloned and functionally expressed in  Pichia pastoris . Homology alignment of amino acid sequences verified that the AnMan5A belongs to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) assay demonstrated that the recombinant AnMan5A (reAnMan5A), a N-glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 52.0 kDa, was secreted into the medium. The highest reAnMan5A activity expressed by one  P. pastoris  transformant, labeled as GSAnMan4-12, reached 29.0 units/mL. The purified reAnMan5A displayed the highest activity at pH 3.5 and 70 °C. It was stable at a pH range of 3.0-7.0 and at a temperature of 60 °C or below. Its activity was not significantly affected by an array of metal ions and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The K(m) and V(max) of the reAnMan5A, toward locust bean gum, were 1.10 mg/mL and 266.7 units/mg, respectively.

A fragment coding for a putative extracellular alpha-amylase, from the genomic library of the yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera KZ, has been subcloned into yeast expression vector pVT100L and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence revealed an ORF of 1,485 bp coding for a 494 amino acid residues long protein with 99% identity to the alpha-amylase Sfamy from S. fibuligera HUT 7212. The S. fibuligera KZ alpha-amylase (Sfamy KZ) belongs to typical extracellular fungal alpha-amylases classified in the glycoside hydrolase family 13, subfamily 1, as supported also by clustering observed in the evolutionary tree. Sfamy KZ, in addition to the essential GH13 alpha-amylase three-domain arrangement (catalytic TIM barrel plus domains B and C), does not contain any distinct starch-binding domain. Sfamy KZ was expressed as a recombinant protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The enzyme had a molecular mass 53 kDa and contained about 2.5% of carbohydrate. The enzyme exhibited pH and temperature optima in the range of 5-6 and 40-50 degrees C, respectively. Stable adsorption of the enzyme to starch granules was not detected but a low degradation of raw starch in a concentration-dependent manner was observed. 
22340848	20120221	Microb._Cell_Fact.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a thermostable β-glucosidase from Aspergillus fumigatus Z5, and its functional expression in Pichia pastoris X33.	Recently, the increased demand of energy has strongly stimulated the research on the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into reducing sugars for the subsequent production, and β-glucosidases have been the focus because of their important roles in a variety fundamental biological processes and the synthesis of useful β-glucosides. Although the β-glucosidases of different sources have been investigated, the amount of β-glucosidases are insufficient for effective conversion of cellulose. The goal of this work was to search for new resources of β-glucosidases, which was thermostable and with high catalytic efficiency. In this study, a thermostable native β-glucosidase (nBgl3), which is secreted by the lignocellulose-decomposing fungus Aspergillus fumigatus Z5, was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Internal sequences of nBgl3 were obtained by LC-MS/MS, and its encoding gene, bgl3, was cloned based on the peptide sequences obtained from the LC-MS/MS results. bgl3 contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 2622 bp and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 91.47 kDa; amino acid sequence analysis of the deduced protein indicated that nBgl3 is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 3. A recombinant β-glucosidase (rBgl3) was obtained by the functional expression of bgl3 in Pichia pastoris X33. Several biochemical properties of purified nBgl3 and rBgl3 were determined - both enzymes showed optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 60°C, and they were stable for a pH range of 4-7 and a temperature range of 50 to 70°C. Of the substrates tested, nBgl3 and rBgl3 displayed the highest activity toward 4-Nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), with specific activities of 103.5 ± 7.1 and 101.7 ± 5.2 U mg-1, respectively. However, these enzymes were inactive toward carboxymethyl cellulose, lactose and xylan. An native β-glucosidase nBgl3 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the crude extract of A. fumigatus Z5. The gene bgl3 was cloned based on the internal sequences of nBgl3 obtained from the LC-MS/MS results, and the gene bgl3 was expressed in Pichia pastoris X33. The results of various biochemical properties of two enzymes including specific activity, pH stability, thermostability, and kinetic properties (Km and Vmax) indicated that they had no significant differences. 
15988573	20050701	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and properties of a family-10 xylanase from Aureobasidium pullulans ATCC 20524 and characterization of the encoding gene.	An extracellular endo-1,4-beta-xylanase was purified from the culture supernatant of the ascomycete Aureobasidium pullulans ATCC 20524 grown on xylan. The purified enzyme was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing, which showed an apparent M (r) of 39 kDa and a pI of 8.9, respectively. Xylanase activity was optimal at pH 6.0 and 70 degrees C. The genomic DNA and cDNAs encoding this protein were cloned and sequenced. The xylanase gene (xynII) encoded a 26 amino acid signal peptide and a 335 amino acid mature protein. DNA regions encoding the signal sequence and the mature protein were interrupted by introns of 56 and 73 bp, respectively. The xynII 5'-noncoding region had two consensus binding sites (5'-GCCARG-3') for the transcription factor PacC mediating pH regulation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the transcription levels at pH 6.0 and 8.0 were 8-fold and 22-fold higher than that at pH 2.7, respectively. A cloned xynII cDNA was expressed and secreted in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that the XynII belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 10 and that it is evolutionarily distant from two clusters formed by other family-10 xylanases. 
2337347	19900515	Arch._Biochem._Biophys.	D016428 D013486 D013487 	Lignin peroxidase H2 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium: purification, characterization and stability to temperature and pH.	The wood-destroying fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium secretes extracellular enzymes known as lignin peroxidases that are involved in the biodegradation of lignin and a number of environmental pollutants. Several lignin peroxidases are produced in liquid cultures of this fungus. However, only lignin peroxidase isozyme H8 has been extensively characterized. In agitated nutrient nitrogen-limited culture, P. chrysosporium produces two lignin peroxidases in about equal proportions. The molecular weights of these two major proteins (H2 and H8) as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 38,500 (H2) and 42,000 (H8). The isoelectric points of these enzymes were 4.3 for H2 and 3.65 for H8. All subsequent experiments in this study were performed with H2 as it contributed the most (42%) to total activity and had the highest specific activity (57.3 U/mg). The Km values of lignin peroxidase H2 for H2O2 and veratryl alcohol were calculated to be 47 microM and 167 microM at pH 3.5, respectively. The pH optima for veratryl alcohol oxidase activity were pH 2.5 at 25 degrees C, pH 3.0 at 35 degrees C, and pH 3.5 at 45 degrees C. In the same manner the temperature optimum shifted from 25 degrees C at pH 2.5 to 45 degrees C at pH 3.5 and approximately 45-60 degrees C at pH 4.5. During storage the resting enzyme was relatively stable for 48 h up to 50 degrees C. Above this temperature the enzyme lost all activity within 6 h at 60 degrees C. At 70 degrees C all activity was lost within 10 min. The resting enzyme retained approximately 80% of its initial activity when stored at 40 degrees C for 21 h at a pH range of 4.0-6.5. Above pH 7.5 and below 4.0, the enzyme lost all activity in less than 5 h. During turnover the enzyme remained active at pH 5.5 for over 2 h whereas the enzyme activity was lost after 45 min at pH 2.5. The oxidation of veratryl alcohol was inhibited by EDTA, azide, cyanide, and by the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, but not by chloride. In the absence of another reducing substrate incubation of lignin peroxidase H2 with excess H2O2 resulted in partial and irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. The spectral characteristics of lignin peroxidase H2 are similar to those of other peroxidases. The suitability of lignin peroxidases for industrial applications is discussed.

A thermostable xylanase from the filamentous fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus (DSM 5826) was purified. This enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 24-26 kDa as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cDNA and genomic DNA fragments coding for this enzyme were cloned and sequenced. The cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 225 amino acids and was functionally expressed in E. coli as a LacZ fusion protein. Comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic DNA sequence showed that the xylanase was encoded by two exons interrupted by an intron of 106 bp. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence to other published xylanases revealed high homology to xylanases of the family G glycanases. 
8856078	19960915	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Primary structure and characterization of an exopolygalacturonase from Aspergillus tubingensis.	From the culture fluid of the hyphal fungus Aspergillus tubingensis, an exopolygalacturonase with a molecular mass of 78 kDa, an isoelectric point in the pH-range 3.7-4.4 and a pH optimum of 4.2 was purified. The enzyme has been characterized as an exopolygalacturonase [poly(1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide)galacturonohydrolase] that cleaves monomer units from the non-reducing end of the substrate molecule. K(m) and Vmax for polygalacturonic acid hydrolysis were 3.2 mg ml-1 and 3.1 mg ml-1 and 255 U mg-1 and 262 U mg-1 for the wild-type and recombinant enzymes, respectively. The kinetic data of exopolygalacturonase on oligogalacturonates of different degree of polymerization (2-7) were interpreted in terms of a subsite model to obtain more insight into catalysis and substrate binding. On oligogalacturonates of different degrees of polymerization (2-7), the Michaelis constant (K(m)) decreased with increasing chain length (n). The Vmax value increased with chain length up to n = 4, then reached a plateau value. The enzyme was competitively inhibited by galacturonic acid (Ki = 0.3 mM) as well as by reduced digalacturonate (Ki = 0.4 mM). The exopolygalacturonase gene (pgaX) was cloned by reverse genetics and shows only 13% overall amino acid sequence identity with A. niger endopolygalacturonases. The exopolygalacturonase is most related to plant polygalacturonases. Only four small stretches of amino acids are conserved between all known endogalacturonases and exopolygalacturonases. Expression of the pgaX gene is inducible with galacturonic acid and is subject to catabolite repression. A fusion between the promoter of the A. niger glycolytic gene encoding pyruvate kinase and the pgaX-coding region was used to achieve high level production of exopolygalacturonase under conditions where no endopolygalacturonases were produced. 
12543554	20030125	Carbohydr._Res.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of an endo-beta-(1-->6)-galactanase from Trichoderma viride.	An endo-beta-(1-->6)-galactanase from Onozuka R-10, a commercial cellulase preparation from Trichoderma viride, was purified 57-fold. Apparent Mr values of the purified enzyme, estimated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, were 47,000 and 17,000, respectively. The enzyme was assayed with a galactan from Prototheca zopfii, which has a high proportion of beta-(1-->6)-linked galactosyl residues. It exhibited maximal activity toward the galactan at pH 4.3. The enzyme hydrolyzed specifically beta-(1-->6)-galactooligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization higher than 3 and their acidic derivatives with 4-O-methyl-glucosyluronic or glucosyluronic groups at the nonreducing terminals. The methyl beta-glycoside of beta-(1-->6)-galactohexaose was degraded to reducing galactooligomers with a degree of polymerization 2-5 as the products at the initial stage of hydrolysis, and galactose and galactobiose at the final stage, indicating that the enzyme can be classified as an endo-galactanase. The extent of hydrolysis of the carbohydrate portion of a radish root arabinogalactan-protein (AGP) increased when alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residues attached to beta-(1-->6)-linked galactosyl side chains of the AGP were removed in advance. The enzyme released galactose, beta-(1-->6)-galactobiose, and 4-O-methyl-beta-glucuronosyl-(1-->6)-galactose as major hydrolysis products when allowed to act exhaustively on the modified AGP. 
1368603	19900801	Agric._Biol._Chem.	D003160 D016428 	Molecular cloning of the glucoamylase gene of Aspergillus shirousami and its expression in Aspergillus oryzae.	The glucoamylase enzyme (GAase) gene from Aspergillus shirousami was cloned and sequenced from genomic and cDNA libraries. The genomic gene was located in the 5.4 kb EcoRI fragment. The deduced amino acid sequence of GAase contained 639 amino acid residues with a relative molecular mass of approximately 68,000 daltons (non-glycosylated form). The genomic gene of A. shirousami GAase was introduced into Aspergillus oryzae. These transformants had increased GAase and raw starch degradation (RSD) activity in culture media and in rice-koji extracts. Analysis by Southern, Northern, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot techniques confirmed the foreign gene was correctly transcribed, translated, and expressed in A. oryzae. 
15262228	20040721	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of Acremonium implicatum alpha-glucosidase having regioselectivity for alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkage.	alpha-Glucosidase with a high regioselectivity for alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages for hydrolysis and transglucosylation was purified from culture broth of Acremonium implicatum. The enzyme was a tetrameric protein (M.W. 440,000), of which the monomer (M.W. 103,000; monomeric structure was expected from cDNA sequence) was composed of two polypeptides (M.W. 51,000 and 60,000) formed possibly by posttranslational proteolysis. Nigerose and maltose were hydrolyzed by the enzyme rapidly, but slowly for kojibiose. The k(0)/K(m) value for nigerose was 2.5-fold higher than that of maltose. Isomaltose was cleaved slightly, and sucrose was not. Maltotriose, maltotetraose, p-nitrophenyl alpha-maltoside and soluble starch were good substrates. The enzyme showed high affinity for maltooligosaccharides and p-nitrophenyl alpha-maltoside. The enzyme had the alpha-1,3- and alpha-1,4-glucosyl transfer activities to synthesize oligosaccharides, but no ability to form alpha-1,2- and alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages. Ability for the formation of alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkage was two to three times higher than that for alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage. Eight kinds of transglucosylation products were synthesized from maltose, in which 3(2)-O-alpha-nigerosyl-maltose and 3(2)-O-alpha-maltosyl-maltose were novel saccharides. 
15716038	20050218	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 	Mutational analysis of a feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus awamori involved in substrate discrimination and pH dependence.	We cloned the feruloyl esterase A gene from Aspergillus awamori (AwfaeA) and engineered it to study substrate specificity and pH dependence of catalysis. Based on the crystal structures of two type-A feruloyl esterases (FAE-III and AnFAEA) from Aspergillus niger, residues located in the flap region of AwFAEA (Asp71, Thr72, Asp77, and Tyr80) were replaced with corresponding amino acid residues (Ile, Arg, Asn, and Phe), respectively, found in the lid of lipases from Rhizomucor miehei (RmLIP) and Humicola lanuginose (HlLIP). Furthermore, Asp77 of AwFAEA, which is conserved in Aspergillus FAEs and lipases, was replaced with a hydrophobic residue (Ile). Kinetic analysis of the mutant enzymes showed that the higher catalytic efficiency of the D77I and Y80F mutants toward alpha-naphthylbutyrate (C4) and alpha-naphthylcaprylate (C8), respectively, was due to a lower K(m) value. The higher catalytic efficiency of D77N toward C4 substrate was due to a combination of decreased K(m) and considerably increased k(cat). The D71I and Y80F mutants showed some activity toward long-acyl chain esters. On the other hand, the D77I mutant had no detectable activity toward phenolic acid methyl esters and feruloylated arabinoxylan. Moreover, the pH optima of the D77I, D77N, and Y80F mutants increased from 5.0 to 7.0-8.0, 7.0, and 6.0, respectively. 
8477731	19930401	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Amino acid sequence of Coprinus macrorhizus peroxidase and cDNA sequence encoding Coprinus cinereus peroxidase. A new family of fungal peroxidases.	Sequence analysis and cDNA cloning of Coprinus peroxidase (CIP) were undertaken to expand the understanding of the relationships of structure, function and molecular genetics of the secretory heme peroxidases from fungi and plants. Amino acid sequencing of Coprinus macrorhizus peroxidase, and cDNA sequencing of Coprinus cinereus peroxidase showed that the mature proteins are identical in amino acid sequence, 343 residues in size and preceded by a 20-residue signal peptide. Their likely identity to peroxidase from Arthromyces ramosus is discussed. CIP has an 8-residue, glycine-rich N-terminal extension blocked with a pyroglutamate residue which is absent in other fungal peroxidases. The presence of pyroglutamate, formed by cyclization of glutamine, and the finding of a minor fraction of a variant form lacking the N-terminal residue, indicate that signal peptidase cleavage is followed by further enzymic processing. CIP is 40-45% identical in amino-acid sequence to 11 lignin peroxidases from four fungal species, and 42-43% identical to the two known Mn-peroxidases. Like these white-rot fungal peroxidases, CIP has an additional segment of approximately 40 residues at the C-terminus which is absent in plant peroxidases. Although CIP is much more similar to horseradish peroxidase (HRP C) in substrate specificity, specific activity and pH optimum than to white-rot fungal peroxidases, the sequences of CIP and HRP C showed only 18% identity. Hence, CIP qualifies as the first member of a new family of fungal peroxidases. The nine invariant residues present in all plant, fungal and bacterial heme peroxidases are also found in CIP. The present data support the hypothesis that only one chromosomal CIP gene exists. In contrast, a large number of secretory plant and fungal peroxidases are expressed from several peroxidase gene clusters. Analyses of three batches of CIP protein and of 49 CIP clones revealed the existence of only two highly similar alleles indicating less peroxidase polymorphism in C. cinereus strains than observed in plants and white-rot fungi. 
9145525	19970401	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Cloning and sequence analysis of cDNA encoding endopolygalacturonase I from Stereum purpureum.	Endopolygalacturonase (endoPG) I was obtained from Stereum purpureum by an improved easier purification procedure. It was found that EndoPG I consisted of three glycosilated proteins with the same isoelectric point and different molecular masses, 42, 45, and 48 kDa, respectively. However, the enzymatic deglycosilation product of endoPG I gave a single band at the position corresponding to 39kDa on SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, the N-terminal amino acid sequences of three endoPGs were identical one another up to 20 residues. A cDNA library was constructed and positive cDNA clones encoding endoPG I were isolated by using antibody raised against the purified endoPG I. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA disclosed a 1212-bp open reading frame that encoded 403 amino acid residues. The N-terminal amino acid sequence (residues 1-20) of endoPG I coincided with the deduced amino acid sequence starting from the 25th residue. Therefore, the sequence of the first 24 residues represented a signal peptide and the remaining sequence, consisting of 379 residues, was the mature protein with molecular mass of 39.1 kDa. The deduced sequence of endoPG I showed 30-45% similarity in comparison with those of bacterial and fungal endoPGs, and the sequence of putative active site residues reported for the endoPGs was highly conserved in the sequence of endoPG I. 
10572260	19991126	Yeast	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of the EXG1 gene from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.	The YlEXG1 gene of Yarrowia lipolytica, encoding an exo-1, 3-beta-glucanase, was isolated by screening a genomic library with a DNA probe obtained by PCR amplification, using oligonucleotides designed according to conserved regions in the EXG1, EXG2 and SSG1 genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. YlEXG1 consists of a 1263 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 421 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 48 209 Da. Northern blot analysis revealed a unique YlEXG1-specific transcript, 1.4 kb long. A putative pre(signal)-peptide of 15 amino acids is proposed at the N-terminal domain of the primary translation product. The deduced amino acid sequence shares a high degree of homology with exo-1, 3-beta-glucanases from other yeast species, including S. cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia angusta and Debaryomyces occidentalis. YlExg1p contains the invariant amino acid positions which have been shown to be important in the catalytic function of family 5 glycosyl hydrolases. Chromoblot analysis indicated that YlEXG1 is located on chromosome VI. Disruption of YlEXG1 did not result in a phenotype under laboratory conditions and did not prevent the yeast-hypha transition. The sequence data reported in this paper have been assigned EMBL Accession No. Z46872. 
12427996	20021113	Plant_Physiol.	D016428 D013486 	Endophytic fungal beta-1,6-glucanase expression in the infected host grass.	Mutualistic fungal endophytes infect many grass species and often confer benefits to the hosts such as reduced herbivory by insects and animals. The physiological interactions between the endophytes and their hosts have not been well characterized. Fungal-secreted proteins are likely to be important components of the interaction. In the interaction between Poa ampla and the endophyte Neotyphodium sp., a fungal beta-1,6-glucanase is secreted into the apoplast, and activity of the enzyme is detectable in endophyte-infected plants. Sequence analysis indicates the beta-1,6-glucanase is homologous to enzymes secreted by the mycoparasitic fungi Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma virens. DNA gel-blot analysis indicated the beta-1,6-glucanase was encoded by a single gene. As a secreted protein, the beta-1,6-glucanase may have a nutritional role for the fungus. In culture, beta-1,6-glucanase activity was induced in the presence of beta-1,6-glucans. From RNA gel blots, similar beta-1,6-glucanases were expressed in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax [Thuill] Nyman) infected with the endophyte species Neotyphodium coenophialum and Epichloë festucae, respectively.

D003160 D016428 	The faeA genes from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis encode ferulic acid esterases involved in degradation of complex cell wall polysaccharides.	We report the cloning and characterization of a gene encoding a ferulic acid esterase, faeA, from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis. The A. niger and A. tubingensis genes have a high degree of sequence identity and contain one conserved intron. The gene product, FAEA, was overexpressed in wild-type A. tubingensis and a protease-deficient A. niger mutant. Overexpression of both genes in wild-type A. tubingensis and an A. niger protease-deficient mutant showed that the A. tubingensis gene product is more sensitive to degradation than the equivalent gene product from A. niger. FAEA from A. niger was identical to A. niger FAE-III (C. B. Faulds and G. Williamson, Microbiology 140:779-787, 1994), as assessed by molecular mass, pH and temperature optima, pI, N-terminal sequence, and activity on methyl ferulate. The faeA gene was induced by growth on wheat arabinoxylan and sugar beet pectin, and its gene product (FAEA) released ferulic acid from wheat arabinoxylan. The rate of release was enhanced by the presence of a xylanase. FAEA also hydrolyzed smaller amounts of ferulic acid from sugar beet pectin, but the rate was hardly affected by addition of an endo-pectin lyase.

An expression plasmid for the manB gene encoding Aspergillus aculeatus beta-d-mannosidase (MANB) was constructed by using an expression vector carrying an improved promoter. After transformation of A. oryzae by the plasmid, several transformants formed colonies emitting fluorescence on a plate containing 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-d-mannopyranoside (MU-Man) under UV-irradiation. The transformant that displayed the strongest fluorescence, named A. oryzae BMN1, produced about 270 mg MANB/l in liquid culture. Recombinant MANB overproduced in BMN1 was purified by two steps of column chromatography to a single protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had a molecular weight of 130,000. Analyses by Southern blotting and genomic PCR demonstrated that a single copy of the plasmid was integrated into the chromosome by recombination at the niaD locus.

Endo-beta-1,4-glucanase A (EG A) of Aspergillus nidulans was purified to homogeneity, and its genomic gene (eglA) was cloned based on partial amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme and sequenced. The eglA gene comprised 1228 bp with four putative introns and encoded a polypeptide of 326 amino acids bearing high homology to the family A cellulases. The eglA promoter activity in A. nidulans was examined using the A. oryzae Taka-amylase A gene as a reporter. Expression of the reporter gene was induced by carboxymethylcellulose and cellobiose, and repressed by glucose, galactose, mannose, xylose, sorbitol, glycerol and succinate. Lactose neither induced nor repressed the expression. 
16349528	20051214	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 	Purification and Characterization of Exo-beta-d-Glucosaminidase from a Cellulolytic Fungus, Trichoderma reesei PC-3-7.	Chitosan-degrading activities induced by glucosamine (GlcN) or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) were found in a culture filtrate of Trichoderma reesei PC-3-7. One of the chitosan-degrading enzymes was purified to homogeneity by precipitation with ammonium sulfate followed by anion-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The enzyme was monomeric, and its molecular mass was 93 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were 4.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The activity was stable in the pH range 6.0 to 9.0 and at a temperature below 50 degrees C. Reaction product analysis from the viscosimetric assay and thin-layer chromatography and H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy clearly indicated that the enzyme was an exo-type chitosanase, exo-beta-d-glucosaminidase, that releases GlcN from the nonreducing end of the chitosan chain. H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy also showed that the exo-beta-d-glucosaminidase produced a beta-form of GlcN, demonstrating that the enzyme is a retaining glycanase. Time-dependent liberation of the reducing sugar from partially acetylated chitosan with exo-beta-d-glucosaminidase and the partially purified exo-beta-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase from T. reesei PC-3-7 suggested that the exo-beta-d-glucosaminidase cleaves the glycosidic link of either GlcN-beta(1-->4)-GlcN or GlcN-beta(1-->4)-GlcNAc.

Yeast exo-beta-1,3-glucanase gene (EXG1) was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant enzyme (Exg1p) was characterized. The recombinant Exglp had an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa by SDS-PAGE and the enzyme has a broad specificity for beta-1,3-linkages as well as beta-1,6-linkages, and also for other beta-glucosidic linked substrates, such as cellobiose and pNPG. Kinetic analyses indicate that the enzyme prefers small substrates such as laminaribiose, gentiobiose, and pNPG rather than polysaccharide substrates, such as laminaran or pustulan. With a high concentration of laminaribiose, the enzyme catalyzed transglucosidation forming laminarioligosaccharides. The enzyme was strongly inhibited with high concentrations of laminaran.

A new Volvariella volvacea gene encoding an acetyl xylan esterase (designated as Vvaxe1) was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The cDNA contained an ORF of 1047 bp encoding 349 amino acids with a calculated mass of 39 990 Da. VvAXE1 is a modular enzyme consisting of an N-terminal signal peptide, a catalytic domain, and a cellulose-binding domain. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme exhibited a high degree of similarity to cinnamoyl esterase B from Penicillium funiculosum, and acetyl xylan esterases from Aspergillus oryzae, Penicillium purpurogenum, and Aspergillus ficuum. Recombinant acetyl xylan esterase released acetate from several acetylated substrates including beta-d-xylose tetraacetate and acetylated xylan. No activity was detectable on p-nitrophenyl acetate. Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate was maximal at pH 8.0 and 60 degrees C, and reciprocal plots revealed an apparent K(m) value of 307.7 microM and a V(max) value of 24 733 IU micromol(-1) protein. ReAXE1 also exhibited a capacity to bind to Avicel and H(3)PO(4) acid-swollen cellulose.

A genomic CAMAL2 clone was obtained by screening a size-selected genomic library with the cDNA clone. DNA sequence analysis reveals that CAMAL2 encodes a 570-amino-acid protein which shares 50% identity with the maltase structural gene (MAL62) of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis. The substrate specificity of the recombinant protein purified from Escherichia coli identifies the enzyme as a maltase. Northern (RNA) analysis reveals that transcription of CAMAL2 is induced by maltose and sucrose and repressed by glucose. These results suggest that assimilation of sucrose in C. albicans relies on an inducible maltase enzyme. The family of genes controlling sucrose utilization in C. albicans shares similarities with the MAL gene family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and provides a model system for studying gene regulation in this pathogenic yeast. 
1612414	19920515	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Nucleotide sequence of the extracellular alpha-amylase gene in the yeast Schwanniomyces occidentalis ATCC 26077.	The Schwanniomyces occidentalis (formerly castellii) ATCC 26077 (CBS 2863) alpha-amylase (AMY 26077) gene was cloned in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and sequenced. An open-reading frame encoding the AMY consists of 1536 base pairs and contains 512 amino-acid residues, which is almost the same in size as the AMY of Sch. occidentalis ATCC 26076 and CCRC 21164. The amino-acid sequence of AMY 26077 differed from that of ATCC 26076 alpha-amylase (AMY 26076) at two residues and from that of CCRC 21164 alpha-amylase (AMY 21164) at three residues. Comparison of the AMY 26077 gene with its homologues from two other strains (Sch. alluvius CBS 1153 and Sch. persoonii CBS 2169) using several restriction enzymes revealed that the AMY 26077 was very similar to AMY CBS 1153 but different from that of CBS 2169. 
8987622	19961001	J._Biotechnol.	D003160 D016428 	Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the cellulase genes of Humicola grisea var. thermoidea.	We have cloned an endoglucanase (EGI) gene and a cellobiohydrolase (CBHI) gene of Humicola grisea var. thermoidea using a portion of the Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I gene as a probe, and determined their nucleotide sequences. The deduced amino acid sequence of EGI was 435 amino acids in length and the coding region was interrupted by an intron. The EGI lacks a hinge region and a cellulose-binding domain. The deduced amino acid sequence of CBHI was identical to the H. grisea CBHI previously reported, with the exception of three amino acids. The H. grisea EGI and CBHI show 39.8% and 37.7% identity with T. reesei EGI, respectively. In addition to TATA box and CAAT motifs, putative CREA binding sites were observed in the 5' upstream regions of both genes. The cloned cellulase genes were expressed in Aspergillus oryzae and the gene products were purified. The optimal temperatures of CBHI and EGI were 60 degrees C and 55-60 degrees C, respectively. The optimal pHs of these enzymes were 5.0. CBHI and EGI had distinct substrate specificities: CBHI showed high activity toward Avicel, whereas EGI showed high activity toward carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). 
21897016	20110908	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Cloning and expression of the endo-1,3(4)-β-glucanase gene from Paecilomyces sp. FLH30 and characterization of the recombinant enzyme.	The cDNA encoding β-1,3(4)-glucanase, named PsBg16A, from Paecilomyces sp. FLH30 was cloned, sequenced, and over expressed in Pichia pastoris, with a yield of about 61,754 U mL⁻¹ in a 5-L fermentor. PsBg16A has an open reading frame of 951 bp encoding 316 amino acids, and the deduced amino acid sequence of PsBg16A revealed that it belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 16. The purified recombinant PsBg16A had a pH optimum at 7.0 and a temperature optimum at 70 °C, and randomly hydrolyzed barley β-glucan, lichenin, and laminarin, suggesting that it is a typical endo-1,3(4)-β-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6) with broad substrate specificity for β-glucans. 
8768520	19960801	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 	Evidence that the Piromyces gene family encoding endo-1,4-mannanases arose through gene duplication.	The sequences of two Piromyces cDNAs (manB and manC) encoding functional mannanases, defined as mannanase B (MANB) and mannanase C (MANC), revealed that both the cDNAs, and the encoded enzymes, exhibited extensive sequence identity with each other and with a previously described Piromyces mannanase. MANB and MANC, which belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 26, hydrolyse several forms of mannan but do not attack the other major plant structural polysaccharides. The data presented in this paper indicate that the Piromyces gene family encoding mannanases arose through gene duplication.

10945248	20000817	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of acid-stable protopectinase produced by Aspergillus awamori in solid-state fermentation.	Aspergillus awamori IFO 4033 produced an acid-stable protopectinase in solid-state fermentation using wheat bran as the medium. The enzyme was purified to a homogeneous preparation with anion-exchange, hydrophobic, and size-exclusion chromatography. The enzyme was a monomeric protein of 52 kDa, by SDS-PAGE analysis, with an isoelectric point of pH 3.7. The optimum pH for enzyme activity was 2.0, and it was most active at 50 degrees C (at pH 2.0) and was stable up to 50 degrees C (at pH 2.0). The enzyme showed pectin-releasing activity toward protopectins from various origins, especially on lemon protopectin. An outstanding characteristic of the enzyme was its extreme stability in acidic conditions: the enzyme activity was not lost after incubating at pH 2.0 and 37 degrees C for 24 h. 
17597340	20070629	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of an alpha-amylase gene from Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	Based on the genomic sequence and cDNA library screening, the cDNA sequence encoding an alpha-amylase was cloned from the filamentous white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium and designated as pcamy1. Alignment results showed that the predicted protein has up to 43% amino acid homology to the known alpha-amylases in other organisms and is close to those from some filamentous fungi. Under nitrogen-starvation condition, the transcription of pcamy1 was accordingly upregulated or downregulated when soluble starch or glucose is sole carbon source. Addition of oxygen to nitrogen-limited media led to pcamy1 transcription and removal of glucose metabolic repression. The result indicated that the pcamy1 transcript was not only regulated by nutrients such as the carbon source but also by the cultivation environment, such as oxygen. This coordinate-regulatory model is likely common in P. chrysosporium. The expressed product of this gene in Escherichia coli could hydrolyze soluble starch, and its enzymatic activity was determined. As far as we know, this is the first report about cloning and expression study on the alpha-amylase in P. chrysosporium.

The cDNA encoding Mn peroxidase isozyme H4 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium was expressed in Escherichia coli. The portion of the cDNA encoding the enzyme's signal peptide, not found in the processed holoenzyme, was deleted from the cDNA. The polypeptide was produced as inactive inclusion bodies that could be solubilized in 8 M urea and the reducing agent dithiothreitol. Reconstitution of activity was accomplished by diluting the urea concentration to 2M in the presence of hemin, calcium, and oxidized glutathione. All of the additives were required for recovery of activity. The activity of the recombinant enzyme was dependent on both Mn2+ and H2O2. 
8440481	19930214	Gene	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of a cellulase-encoding cDNA (cbh1) from Penicillium janthinellum.	From a Penicillium janthinellum cDNA library, two clones with 1.8- and 1.9-kb inserts were isolated by hybridization to a Trichoderma reesei cellulase-encoding gene probe (egl1). Both cDNAs have identical 5' ends and coding sequences, but different polyadenylation start points in their 3' untranslated regions. In the nucleotide (nt) sequence, one open reading frame of 537 amino acids was detected which shows 56% homology with endoglucanase I of T. reesei and 70% homology with cellobiohydrolase I of T. reesei, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Humicola grisea. Expression of the 1.9-kb cDNA in the Escherichia coli T7 system led to the detection of a 57-kDa protein, in agreement with the theoretical value. Fusion to the promoter of the yeast phosphoglycerokinase-encoding gene led to efficient expression and partial secretion of the cDNA-encoded cellulase with cellobiohydrolase I activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
16140328	20050906	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	A family 10 Thermoascus aurantiacus xylanase utilizes arabinose decorations of xylan as significant substrate specificity determinants.	Xylan, which is a key component of the plant cell wall, consists of a backbone of beta-1,4-linked xylose residues that are decorated with arabinofuranose, acetyl, 4-O-methyl d-glucuronic acid and ferulate. The backbone of xylan is hydrolysed by endo-beta1,4-xylanases (xylanases); however, it is unclear whether the various side-chains of the polysaccharide are utilized by these enzymes as significant substrate specificity determinants. To address this question we have determined the crystal structure of a family 10 xylanase from Thermoascus aurantiacus, in complex with xylobiose containing an arabinofuranosyl-ferulate side-chain. We show that the distal glycone subsite of the enzyme makes extensive direct and indirect interactions with the arabinose side-chain, while the ferulate moiety is solvent-exposed. Consistent with the 3D structural data, the xylanase displays fourfold more activity against xylotriose in which the non-reducing moiety is linked to an arabinose side-chain, compared to the undecorated form of the oligosacchairde. These data indicate that the sugar decorations of xylans in the T.aurantiacus family 10 xylanase, rather than simply being accommodated, can be significant substrate specificity determinants. 
23410931	20130216	Enzyme_Microb._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	An endo-1,4-β-glucanase PdCel5C from cellulolytic fungus Penicillium decumbens with distinctive domain composition and hydrolysis product profile.	Cellulases from fungi typically contain one catalytic domain with or without a cellulose-binding domain. We characterized an endo-acting cellulase PdCel5C from industrial cellulase-producing fungus Penicillium decumbens with distinctive domain composition. In addition to a cellulose-binding domain and a catalytic domain, PdCel5C contains two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains near the C-terminal end. Truncated mutation experiment reveals that the two Ig-like domains are important for the hydrolytic activity of PdCel5C. Moreover, PdCel5C releases cello-oligosaccharides from cellulosic substrates, which is different from that of most characterized cellulases in the same glycoside hydrolase family 5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the characterization of an Ig-like domain-containing cellulase in fungi. The results expand our understanding on the diversity of cellulases in fungi, and suggest possible shared catalytic mechanisms between bacterial and fungal cellulases.

The aa sequence of the GLRI displayed no similarity with any aa sequence available in the data bases. 
14665735	20031211	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D003160 D016428 	Cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization of Thielavia terrestris glucoamylase.	Thielavia terrestris is a soil-borne thermophilic fungus whose molecular/ cellular biology is poorly understood. Only a few genes have been cloned from the Thielavia genus. We detected an extracellular glucoamylase in culture filtrates of T. terrestris and cloned the corresponding glaA gene. The coding region contains five introns. Based on the amino acid sequence, the glucoamylase was 65% identical to Neurospora crassa glucoamylase. Sequence comparisons suggested that the enzyme belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family 15. The T. terrestris glaA gene was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae under the control of an A. oryzae alpha-amylase promoter and an Aspergillus niger glucoamylase terminator. The 75-kDa recombinant glucoamylase showed a specific activity of 2.8 micromol/(min x mg) with maltose as substrate. With maltotriose as a substrate, the enzyme had an optimum pH of 4.0 and an optimum temperature of 60 degrees C. The enzyme was stable at 60 degrees C for 30 min. The Km and kcat of the enzyme for maltotriose were determined at various pHs and temperatures. At 20 degrees C and pH 4.0, the enzyme had a Km of 0.33 +/- 0.07 mM and a kcat of (5.5 +/- 0.5) x 103 min(-1) for maltotriose. The temperature dependence of kcat/Km indicated an activation free energy of 2.8 kJ/mol across the range of 20-70 degrees C. Overall, the enzyme derived from the thermophilic fungus exhibited properties comparable with that of its homolog derived from mesophilic fungi. 
8572698	19960101	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Expression of Aureobasidium pullulans xynA in, and secretion of the xylanase from, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	A previous report dealt with the cloning in Escherichia coli and sequencing of both the cDNA and genomic DNA encoding a highly active xylanase (XynA) of Aureobasidium pullulans (X.-L. Li and L. G. Ljungdahl, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:3160-3166, 1994). Now we show that the gene was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the GAL1 promoter in pYES2 and that its product was secreted into the culture medium. S. cerevisiae clone pCE4 with the whole open reading frame of xynA, including the part coding for the signal peptide, had xylanase activity levels of 6.7 U ml-1 in the cell-associated fraction and 26.2 U ml-1 in the culture medium 4 h after galactose induction. Two protein bands with sizes of 25 and 27 kDa and N-terminal amino acid sequences identical to that of APX-II accounted for 82% of the total proteins in the culture medium of pCE4. These proteins were recognized by anti-APX-II antibody. The results suggest that the XynA signal peptide supported the posttranslational processing of xynA product and the efficient secretion of the active xylanase from S. cerevisiae. Clones pCE3 and pGE3 with inserts of cDNA and genomic DNA, respectively, containing only the mature enzyme region attached by a Met codon had low levels of xylanase activity in the cell-associated fractions (1.6 U ml-1) but no activity in the culture media. No xylanase activity was detected in clone pGE4, which was the same as pCE4, except that pGE4 had a 59-bp intron in the signal peptide region. A comparison of the A. pullulans and S. cerevisiae signal peptides demonstrated that the XynA signal peptide was at least three times more efficient than those of S. cerevisiae invertase or mating alpha-factor pheromone in secreting the heterologous xylanase from S. cerevisiae cells. 
10553664	19991220	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Hydrolytic properties of a beta-mannosidase purified from Aspergillus niger.	A beta-mannosidase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrate of Aspergillus niger. A specific activity of 500 nkat mg-1 and a 53-fold purification was achieved using ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The isolated enzyme has an isoelectric point of 5.0 and appears to be a dimer composed of two 135-kDa subunits. It is a glycoprotein and contains 17% N-linked carbohydrate by weight. Maximal activity was observed at pH 2.4 5.0 and at 70 degrees C. The beta-mannosidase hydrolyzed beta-1,4-linked manno-oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization (DP) 2-6 and also released mannose from polymeric ivory nut mannan and galactomannan. The Km and Vmax values for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-mannopyranoside were 0.30 mM and 500 nkat mg-1, respectively. Hydrolysis of D-galactose substituted manno-oligosaccharides showed that the beta-mannosidase was able to cleave up to, but not beyond, a side group. An internal peptide sequence of 15 amino acids was highly similar to that of an Aspergillus aculeatus beta-mannosidase belonging to family 2 of glycosyl hydrolases. 
11795847	20020125	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular characterization of a novel endo-beta-1,4-xylanase gene from the vascular wilt fungus Fusarium oxysporum.	A gene, xyl5, was identified from the tomato vascular wilt fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici, whose predicted amino acid sequence shows significant homology with family 11 xylanases. Expression of xyl5 was detected during growth both on xylan and cellulose substrates as carbon sources and on tomato vascular tissue. RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of two different transcript sizes, resulting from differential splicing of the third intron. The 3'-untranslated region of the xyl5 transcript contained a region of homology to cellulose-binding domains, suggesting that such a domain may have been part of an ancestral XYL5 version. As shown by RT-PCR, xyl5 is expressed by F. oxysporum exclusively during the initial stages of infection in tomato roots. Targeted inactivation of xyl5 had no detectable effect on virulence. 
11916668	20020328	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 	EglC, a new endoglucanase from Aspergillus niger with major activity towards xyloglucan.	A novel gene, eglC, encoding an endoglucanase, was cloned from Aspergillus niger. Transcription of eglC is regulated by XlnR, a transcriptional activator that controls the degradation of polysaccharides in plant cell walls. EglC is an 858-amino-acid protein and contains a conserved C-terminal cellulose-binding domain. EglC can be classified in glycoside hydrolase family 74. No homology to any of the endoglucanases from Trichoderma reesei was found. In the plant cell wall xyloglucan is closely linked to cellulose fibrils. We hypothesize that the EglC cellulose-binding domain anchors the enzyme to the cellulose chains while it is cleaving the xyloglucan backbone. By this action it may contribute to the degradation of the plant cell wall structure together with other enzymes, including hemicellulases and cellulases. EglC is most active towards xyloglucan and therefore is functionally different from the other two endoglucanases from A. niger, EglA and EglB, which exhibit the greatest activity towards beta-glucan. Although the mode of action of EglC is not known, this enzyme represents a new enzyme function involved in plant cell wall polysaccharide degradation by A. niger. 
17964183	20071030	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Identification and expression of cellobiohydrolase (CBHI) gene from an endophytic fungus, Fusicoccum sp. (BCC4124) in Pichia pastoris.	A gene encoding a cellobiohydrolase (CBHI) was isolated from Fusicoccum sp. (BCC4124), an endophytic fungus belongs in phylum Ascomycota, using 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) technique. This CBHI gene contains 1395 nucleotides and encodes a 465-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed significant similarity to those of other fungal CBHI belonging to family 7 of glycosyl hydrolase. Interestingly, the result from the amino acid alignment revealed that this CBHI does not contain the cellulose binding domain nor the linker region. The CBHI gene was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris KM71. The purified recombinant CBHI has ability to hydrolyze Avicel, filter paper and 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-d-cellobioside (MUC) but not carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). It showed an optimal working condition at 40 degrees C, pH 5 with K(m) and V(max) toward MUC of 0.57 mM and 3.086 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The purified enzyme was stable at pH range of 3-11. The enzyme retained approximately 50% of its maximal activity after incubating at 70-90 degrees C for 30 min. Due to its stability through wide range of pH, and moderately stable at high temperature, this enzyme has potential in various biotechnology applications. 
19725536	20090904	J._Agric._Food_Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, characterization, and functional analysis of the EPG1-2 gene: a new allele coding for an endopolygalacturonase in Kluyveromyces marxianus.	A new allele, the EPG1-2 gene, which codes for an endopolygalacturonase in Kluyveromyces marxianus CECT1043, has been cloned. The gene has 1086 bp and the protein 362 amino acids, one more than the previously described Epg1p. Epg1-2p shows a high degree of similarity with the polygalacturonases of fungi and yeasts. The sequences common to all of the polygalacturonases of prokaryotes, fungi, and higher plants are also conserved in Epg1-2p. The EPG1-2 gene has been expressed in Pichia pastoris , and, when fused with the signal peptide of the alpha-factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the protein is properly secreted into the media. The recombinant enzyme does not appear to be fully glycosylated by P. pastoris or not glycosylated in the same manner as in K. marxianus, but it maintains the same optimum temperature (55 degrees C) and pH (4.5) and the same stability at different temperatures and pH values as the native enzyme, also showing the same hydrolytic behavior. The recombinant strain produces 200-fold more enzyme than the wild-type strain of K. marxianus, making it a yeast of potential industrial interest for the production of endopolygalacturonase for the food industry. 
12466887	20021206	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Use of a histone H4 promoter to drive the expression of homologous and heterologous proteins by Penicillium funiculosum.	Two genes encoding histone H4 (H4.1 and H4.2) from Penicillium funiculosum have been cloned and characterised. Structurally, the histone H4.1 gene is divergently linked to the histone H3 gene and the two genes are separated by approximately 800 bp. The transcription of the histone H4.1 and H4.2 genes in P. funiculosum appears to be distinctively regulated. Histone H4.1 mRNA showed a high steady-state level during the early stages of batch culture that decreased as growth reached the stationary phase. In contrast, the expression of the histone H4.2 gene was lower than that of H4.1 throughout batch growth and increased gradually with time. In order to expand the industrial application of P. funiculosum as a host for the production of heterologous proteins, the promoter of the histone H4.1 gene was successfully used to drive the expression of an intracellular bacterial enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, and a secreted homologous enzyme, xylanase C. The constitutive secretion of xylanase C was achieved in the absence of other xylanases by batch fermentation in the presence of glucose. 
8400376	19930701	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D016428 D013486 D013487 	Cloning and targeted gene disruption of XYL1, a beta 1,4-xylanase gene from the maize pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum.	The gene, XYL1, encoding the major extracellular endo-beta 1,4-xylanase from the maize pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum was cloned using a synthetic, degenerate oligonucleotide based on a tryptic fragment from the purified enzyme. The deduced product of XYL1 has a M(r) of 20,869 and a predicted pI of 9.1, in good agreement with the measured M(r) and pI of the purified enzyme. The XYL1 product has strong amino acid identity to seven endo-beta 1,4-xylanases from six prokaryotes but no obvious similarity to 10 other prokaryotic endoxylanases or a yeast endoxylanase. An internal fragment of the gene was used to create a specific xylanase mutant by transformation-mediated gene disruption via homologous recombination. Total extracellular xylanase activity in the mutant was reduced by 85-94%. When analyzed by cation exchange HPLC, culture filtrates of the mutant and wild type had identical protein profiles, but the mutant lacked the major peak of UV absorption corresponding to the major xylanase activity. Xylanase II activity was also missing in the mutant, but xylanase III activity was still present. The XYL1 mutant grew as well as the wild type on sucrose, on corn cell walls, and on xylan. The pathogenicity of the mutant was indistinguishable from the wild type, indicating that XYL1 is not required for pathogenicity. 
19575195	20090704	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of endo-beta-1,4-glucanase from a novel strain of Penicillium pinophilum KMJ601.	A novel endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (EG)-producing strain was isolated and identified as Penicillium pinophilum KMJ601 based on its morphology and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA gene sequence. When rice straw and corn steep powder were used as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, the maximal EG activity of 5.0 U mg protein(-1), one of the highest levels among EG-producing microorganisms, was observed. The optimum temperature and pH for EG production were 28 degrees C and 5.0, respectively. The increased production of EG by P. pinophilum in culture at 28 degrees C was confirmed by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by MS/MS sequencing of the partial peptide. A partial EG gene (eng5) was amplified by degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the peptide sequence. A full-length eng5 was cloned by genome-walking PCR, and P. pinophilum EG was identified as a member of glycoside hydrolase family 5. The present results should contribute to improved industrial production of EG by P. pinophilum KMJ601. 
17229143	20070119	FEBS_J.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	An investigation of the substrate specificity of the xyloglucanase Cel74A from Hypocrea jecorina.	The substrate specificity of the xyloglucanase Cel74A from Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) was examined using several polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. Our results revealed that xyloglucan chains are hydrolyzed at substituted Glc residues, in contrast to the action of all known xyloglucan endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.151). The building block of xyloglucan, XXXG (where X is a substituted Glc residue, and G is an unsubstituted Glc residue), was rapidly degraded to XX and XG (k(cat) = 7.2 s(-1) and Km = 120 microM at 37 degrees C and pH 5), which has only been observed before with the oligoxyloglucan-reducing-end-specific cellobiohydrolase from Geotrichum (EC 3.2.1.150). However, the cellobiohydrolase can only release XG from XXXGXXXG, whereas Cel74A hydrolyzed this substrate at both chain ends, resulting in XGXX. Differences in the length of a specific loop at subsite + 2 are discussed as being the basis for the divergent specificity of these xyloglucanases.

The enzymes released arabinose from p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside, O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1-->3)-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-x ylopyranose, and arabinose-containing polysaccharides but not from O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1-->3)-O-b eta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-xylopyra nose. alpha-L-Arabinofuranosidase I also released arabinose from O-beta-D-xylopy-ranosyl-(1-->4)-[O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl- (1-->3)]- O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-xylopyranose. However, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase II did not readily catalyze this hydrolysis reaction. alpha-L-Arabinofuranosidase I hydrolyzed all linkages that can occur between two alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residues in the following order: (1-->5) linkage > (1-->3) linkage > (1-->2) linkage. alpha-L-Arabinofuranosidase II hydrolyzed the linkages in the following order: (1-->5) linkage > (1-->2) linkage > (1-->3) linkage. alpha-L-Arabinofuranosidase I preferentially hydrolyzed the (1-->5) linkage of branched arabinotrisaccharide. On the other hand, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase II preferentially hydrolyzed the (1-->3) linkage in the same substrate. alpha-L-Arabinofuranosidase I released arabinose from the nonreducing terminus of arabinan, whereas alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase II preferentially hydrolyzed the arabinosyl side chain linkage of arabinan. 
10103256	19990402	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and partial characterization of endopolygalacturonase genes from Botrytis cinerea.	Botrytis cinerea is a plant-pathogenic fungus infecting over 200 different plant species. We use a molecular genetic approach to study the process of pectin degradation by the fungus. Recently, we described the cloning and characterization of an endopolygalacturonase (endoPG) gene from B. cinerea (Bcpg1) which is required for full virulence. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of five additional endoPG-encoding genes from B. cinerea SAS56. The identity at the amino acid level between the six endoPGs of B. cinerea varied from 34 to 73%. Phylogenetic analysis, by using a group of 35 related fungal endoPGs and as an outgroup one plant PG, resulted in the identification of five monophyletic groups of closely related proteins. The endoPG proteins from B. cinerea SAS56 could be assigned to three different monophyletic groups. DNA blot analysis revealed the presence of the complete endoPG gene family in other strains of B. cinerea, as well as in other Botrytis species. Differential gene expression of the gene family members was found in mycelium grown in liquid culture with either glucose or polygalacturonic acid as the carbon source. 
8065265	19940501	Mol._Microbiol.	D016428 	Regulation of the xylanase-encoding xlnA gene of Aspergillus tubigensis.	A gene encoding an endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from Aspergillus tubigensis was cloned by oligonucleotide screening using oligonucleotides derived from amino acid sequence data obtained from the purified protein. The isolated gene was functional as it could be expressed in the very closely related fungus Aspergillus niger. The xylanase encoded by this gene is synthesized as a protein of 211 amino acids. After cleavage of the presumed prepropeptide this results in a mature protein of 184 amino acids with a molecular weight of 19 kDa and an isoelectric point of 3.6. The regulatory region of the xlnA gene was studied with respect to the response to xylan induction and carbon catabolite repression. By deletion analysis of the 5' upstream region of the gene a 158 bp region involved in the xylan specific induction was identified. To study this regulatory element a reporter system for transcriptional activating sequences was developed that is based on the A. niger glucose oxidase-encoding gene. From the results with this reporter system it is concluded that this 158 bp fragment not only contains the information required for induction of transcription but that it also plays a role in carbon catabolite repression of the xlnA gene. The region directly upstream of this fragment contains four potential CREA target sites; deletion of this region leads to an increase in the level of transcription. These results suggest that carbon catabolite repression of the xlnA gene is controlled at two levels, directly by repression of xlnA gene transcription and indirectly by repression of the expression of a transcriptional activator. This type of mechanism would be similar to the double lock mechanism for the regulation of gene expression of alcA in Aspergillus nidulans. The reporter system was also used to study the regulation of expression via the functions located on this fragment in A. niger and in A. nidulans. Essentially the same pattern of regulation was found in both of these hosts. Therefore, regulation of xylanase gene expression is basically conserved in all three aspergilli. 
11523809	20010829	Mol._Genet._Genomics	D016428 D013485 	Functional cloning of an endo-arabinanase from Aspergillus aculeatus and its heterologous expression in A. or oryzae and tobacco.	Functional cloning in yeast has been used to isolate full-length cDNAs encoding an endo-alpha-1,5-L-arabinanase from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus. Screening of a cDNA library constructed in a yeast expression vector for transformants that hydrolysed AZCL-arabinan identified 44 Saccharomyces cerevisiae clones all harbouring the same arabinanase-encoding cDNA. The cloned cDNA was expressed in A. oryzae and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. The mode of action of the enzyme was studied by analysis of the digestion pattern towards debranched arabinan. The digestion profile obtained strongly suggests that the enzyme is an endo-arabinanase. In addition, the feasibility using Nicotiana tabacum as an alternative host for arabinanase expression was investigated. 
11931668	20020405	Biochem._J.	D016428 	The Aspergillus niger faeB gene encodes a second feruloyl esterase involved in pectin and xylan degradation and is specifically induced in the presence of aromatic compounds.	The faeB gene encoding a second feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus niger has been cloned and characterized. It consists of an open reading frame of 1644 bp containing one intron. The gene encodes a protein of 521 amino acids that has sequence similarity to that of an Aspergillus oryzae tannase. However, the encoded enzyme, feruloyl esterase B (FAEB), does not have tannase activity. Comparison of the physical characteristics and substrate specificity of FAEB with those of a cinnamoyl esterase from A. niger [Kroon, Faulds and Williamson (1996) Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 23, 255-262] suggests that they are in fact the same enzyme. The expression of faeB is specifically induced in the presence of certain aromatic compounds, but not in the presence of other constituents present in plant-cell-wall polysaccharides such as arabinoxylan or pectin. The expression profile of faeB in the presence of aromatic compounds was compared with the expression of A. niger faeA, encoding feruloyl esterase A (FAEA), and A. niger bphA, the gene encoding a benzoate-p-hydroxylase. All three genes have different subsets of aromatic compounds that induce their expression, indicating the presence of different transcription activating systems in A. niger that respond to aromatic compounds. Comparison of the activity of FAEA and FAEB on sugar-beet pectin and wheat arabinoxylan demonstrated that they are both involved in the degradation of both polysaccharides, but have opposite preferences for these substrates. FAEA is more active than FAEB towards wheat arabinoxylan, whereas FAEB is more active than FAEA towards sugar-beet pectin. 
21181156	20101225	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Identification of a GH62 α-L-arabinofuranosidase specific for arabinoxylan produced by Penicillium chrysogenum.	An arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase (AXS5) was purified from the culture filtrate of Penicillium chrysogenum 31B. A cDNA encoding AXS5 (axs5) was isolated by in vitro cloning using the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the native enzyme as a starting point. The deduced amino acid sequence of the axs5 gene has high similarities with those of arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolases of Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus tubingensis, and Aspergillus sojae. Module sequence analysis revealed that a "Glyco_hydro_62" was present at position 28-299 of AXS5. This is a family of α-L-arabinofuranosidases which are all members of glycoside hydrolase family 62. Recombinant AXS5 (rAXS5) expressed in Escherichia coli was highly active on arabinoxylan but not on branched sugar beet arabinan. (1)H-NMR analysis revealed that the rAXS5 cleaved arabinosyl side-chains linked to C-2 and C-3 of single-substituted xylose residues in arabinoxylan. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that expression of the axs5 gene in P. chrysogenum 31B was strongly induced by adding D-xylose and arabinoxylan to the culture medium. Moreover, two binding sites of XlnR, a transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of the genes encoding xylanolytic enzymes, are present in the upstream region of the axs5 gene. These results suggest that AXS5 is involved in xylan degradation. 
10725538	20000322	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	An alpha-glucuronidase of Schizophyllum commune acting on polymeric xylan.	The main alpha-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.131) of the fungus Schizophyllum commune was purified to homogeneity using standard chromatographic methods; anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 125 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a pI value of 3.6 according to isoelectric focusing. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the S. commune alpha-glucuronidase did not show any homology with other alpha-glucuronidases. It exhibited maximal activity at pH values from 4.5 to 5.5 and was stable for 24 h between pH 6 and 8 at 40 degrees C. The highest temperature at which the enzyme retained its full activity for 24 h at pH 5.8 was 40 degrees C. The alpha-glucuronidase of S. commune was able to remove almost all 4-O-methylglucuronic acid groups from water-soluble polymeric softwood arabinoglucuronoxylans. The action of the enzyme on birchwood acetyl-glucuronoxylan was limited due to the high amount of acetyl substituents. The degree of hydrolysis of partially soluble deacetylated glucuronoxylan did not exceed 50% of the theoretical maximum. However, together with a xylanase hydrolysing the xylan backbone the action of the alpha-glucuronidase of S. commune on glucuronoxylan was clearly enhanced. It was apparent that the enzyme was able to remove the 4-O-methylglucuronic groups mainly from soluble substrates. 
17043824	20061018	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013486 	A type B feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus nidulans with broad pH applicability.	A hypothetical protein AN1772.2 of Aspergillus nidulans was found to have a 56% identity with a known type C ferulic acid esterase (FAE) from Talaromyces stipitatus. In addition, it contained a 13-amino acid conserved region flanking the characteristic G-X-S-X-G motif of a serine esterase, suggesting a FAE function for the protein. The putative FAE was successfully cloned from the genomic DNA and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The recombinant protein exhibited high FAE activities. Therefore, its function as an FAE was unequivocally determined. About 86% of the enzyme activity was found in the growth medium, indicating that the native signal peptide was effective in the yeast expression system. The recombinant FAE was purified to its homogeneity, and subsequently characterized. The FAE is stable over an unusually wide range of pH (4.0-9.5), has a pH optimum of 7.0, and a temperature optimum of 45 degrees C. A substrate specificity profiling reveals that the enzyme is a type B FAE, despite its strong sequence homology with type C FAEs, raising an interesting question on the role of the conserved region in substrate specificity. 
8135518	19940201	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013486 	Cloning and targeted gene disruption of EXG1, encoding exo-beta 1, 3-glucanase, in the phytopathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum.	The phytopathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum produces an extracellular enzyme capable of degrading beta 1,3-glucan in an exolytic manner. On the basis of partial amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme, two degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as PCR primers to amplify a 1.1-kb fragment of corresponding genomic DNA. The PCR product was used to isolate the genomic copy of the gene, called EXG1. Partial sequencing of the genomic DNA confirmed that the PCR product corresponded to EXG1. A strain of the fungus specifically mutated in the EXG1 gene was constructed by homologous integration of an internal fragment of EXG1. In the mutant, enzymatic activity and the corresponding peak of UV absorption during high-pressure liquid chromatography purification were reduced by at least 98%. However, crude culture filtrates of the mutant retained 44% of the wild-type beta 1,3-glucanase activity. This residual activity was due to two additional activities which were chromatographically separable from the product of EXG1 and which were coeluted with beta 1,3-beta 1,4-glucanase activity. Growth of the EXG1 mutant was normal on sucrose and oat bran but was reduced by 65% on pure beta 1,3-glucan. The EXG1 mutant was still pathogenic to maize.

An exo-arabinanase, designated Abnx, was purified from a culture filtrate of Penicillium chrysogenum 31B by ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic chromatography. Abnx had an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa. The enzyme released only arabinobiose from the nonreducing terminus of alpha-1,5-L-arabinan and showed no activity towards p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and alpha-1,5-L-arabinofuranobiose. Abnx is the first enzyme with this mode of action.

D016428 D013485 	Structure and characteristics of an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, isolated from Trametes hirsuta, with high degradation to crystalline cellulose.	Trametes hirsuta produced cellulose-degrading enzymes when it was grown in a cellulosic medium such as Avicel or wheat bran. An endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (ThEG) was purified from the culture filtrate, and the gene and the cDNA were isolated. The gene consisted of an open reading frame encoding 384 amino acids, interrupted by 11 introns. The whole sequence showed high homology with that of family 5 glycoside hydrolase. The properties of the recombinant enzyme (rEG) in Aspergillus oryzae were compared with those of the En-1 from Irpex lacteus, which showed the highest homology among all the endoglucanases reported. The rEG activity against Avicel was about 8 times higher than that of En-1 when based on CMC degradation. A remarkable structural difference between the two enzymes was the length of the linker connecting the cellulose-binding domain to the catalytic domain. 
20592022	20100702	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Structural analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-galactosidase and its complexes with natural substrates reveals new insights into substrate specificity of GH27 glycosidases.	Alpha-galactosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-1,6-galactosyl units from galacto-oligosaccharides and polymeric galactomannans. The crystal structures of tetrameric Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-galactosidase and its complexes with the substrates melibiose and raffinose have been determined to 1.95, 2.40, and 2.70 A resolution. The monomer folds into a catalytic (alpha/beta)(8) barrel and a C-terminal beta-sandwich domain with unassigned function. This pattern is conserved with other family 27 glycosidases, but this enzyme presents a unique 45-residue insertion in the beta-sandwich domain that folds over the barrel protecting it from the solvent and likely explaining its high stability. The structure of the complexes and the mutational analysis show that oligomerization is a key factor in substrate binding, as the substrates are located in a deep cavity making direct interactions with the adjacent subunit. Furthermore, docking analysis suggests that the supplementary domain could be involved in binding sugar units distal from the scissile bond, therefore ascribing a role in fine-tuning substrate specificity to this domain. It may also have a role in promoting association with the polymeric substrate because of the ordered arrangement that the four domains present in one face of the tetramer. Our analysis extends to other family 27 glycosidases, where some traits regarding specificity and oligomerization can be formulated on the basis of their sequence and the structures available. These results improve our knowledge on the activity of this important family of enzymes and give a deeper insight into the structural features that rule modularity and protein-carbohydrate interactions.

Manganese peroxidase (MnP) was isolated from the culture filtrate of the wood log mushroom Stereum ostrea (S. ostrea), grown on Koroljova medium, and then purified by ammonium sulfate [70% (w/v)] fractionation, DEAE-cellulose anion exchange chromatography, and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, with an attainment of 88.6-fold purification and the recovery of 22.8% of initial activity. According to SDS-PAGE the molecular mass of the MnP was 40 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature were found to be 4.5 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was stable even after exposure to a pH range of 4.5 to 6.0, and at temperatures of up to 35 degrees C at a pH of 4.5 for 1h. The K(m) and V(max) values for the substrate phenol red were found to be 8 micronm and 111.14 U/mg of protein, respectively. The MnP also oxidized other substrates such as guaiacol, DMP, and veratryl alcohol. Sodium azide, EDTA, SDS, Cu(2+), and Fe(2+), at 1-5 mM, strongly inhibited enzyme activity, whereas Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) increased enzyme activity. The participation of the purified enzyme in the decolorization of dyes suggests that S. ostrea manganese peroxidase could be effectively employed in textile industries. 
18704748	20080816	Antonie_Van_Leeuwenhoek	D016428 D013485 	A flax-retting endopolygalacturonase-encoding gene from Rhizopus oryzae.	A polygalacturonase from the filamentous fungus Rhizopus oryzae strain sb (NRRL 29086), previously shown to be effective in the retting of flax fibers, was shown by the analysis of its reaction products on polygalacturonic acid to be an endo-type. By zymogram analysis, the enzyme in the crude culture filtrate appeared as two active species of 37 and 40 kD. The endopolygalacturonase-encoding gene was cloned in Escherichia coli and its translated 383-amino acid sequence found to be identical to that of a presumed exopolygalacturonase found in R. oryzae strain YM9901 and 96% identical to a hypothetical protein (RO3G_04731.1) in the sequenced genome of R. oryzae strain 99-880. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of an unique cluster of Rhizopus polygalacturonase sequences that are separate from other fungal polygalacturonases. Conservation of 12 cysteines appears to be a special feature of this family of Rhizopus polygalacturonase sequences. 
12237858	20020919	Yeast	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Cloning and analysis of CoEXG1, a secreted 1,3-beta-glucanase of the yeast biocontrol agent Candida oleophila.	Lytic enzymes may have a role in the biological control of fungi. The yeast biocontrol agent, Candida oleophila, is an excellent subject to research this matter. In the present study, CoEXG1, which encodes for a secreted 1,3-beta-glucanase, is the first gene to be cloned from C. oleophila. It was isolated from a partial genomic library and analysed. Its open reading frame and putative promoter were expressed in baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The reading frame, expressed under the inducible GAL1 promoter, caused an increased secretion of beta-glucanase, and the putative promoter region activated the lacZ reporter gene, to which it was fused. Sequencing analysis revealed that CoEXG1 carries the signature pattern of the 5 glycohydrolases family and has a putative secretion leader, as well as a high degree of identity to yeast 1,3-beta-glucanases. The GenBank Accession No. of CoEXG1 is AF393806.

A glycoside hydrolase responsible for laminarin degradation was partially purified to homogeneity from a Ustilago esculenta culture filtrate by weak-cation-exchange, strong-cation-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography. Three proteins in enzymatically active fractions were digested with chymotrypsin followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis, resulting in the identification of three peptide sequences that shared significant similarity to a putative β-1,3-glucanase, a member of glucoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16) from Sporisorium reilianum SRZ2. A gene encoding a laminarin-degrading enzyme from U. esculenta, lam16A, was isolated by PCR using degenerate primers designed based on the S. reilianum SRZ2 β-1,3-glucanase gene. Lam16A possesses a GH16 catalytic domain with an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor peptide. Recombinant Lam16A fused to an N-terminal FLAG peptide (Lam16A-FLAG) overexpressed in Aspergillus oryzae exhibited hydrolytic activity toward β-1,3-glucan specifically and was localized both in the extracellular and in the membrane fractions but not in the cell wall fraction. Lam16A without a GPI anchor signal peptide was secreted extracellularly and was not detected in the membrane fraction. Membrane-anchored Lam16A-FLAG was released completely by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. These results suggest that Lam16A is anchored in the plasma membrane in order to modify β-1,3-glucan associated with the inner cell wall and that Lam16A is also used for the catabolism of β-1,3-glucan after its release in the extracellular medium.

The beta-mannanase gene (man1) from Aspergillus aculeatus MRC11624 (Izuka) was patented for application in the coffee industry. For production of the enzyme, the gene was originally cloned and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However the level of production was found to be economically unfeasible. Here we report a 13-fold increase in enzyme production through the successful expression of beta-mannanase of Aspergillus aculeatus MRC11624 in Aspergillus niger under control of the A. niger glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (gpd (P)) and the A. awamori glucoamylase terminator (glaA(T)). The effect of medium composition on mannanase production was evaluated, and it was found that the glucose concentration and the organic nitrogen source had an effect on both the volumetric enzyme activity and the specific enzyme activity. The highest mannanase activity levels of 16,596 nkat ml(-1) and 574 nkat mg(-1) dcw were obtained for A. niger D15[man1] when cultivated in a process-viable medium containing corn steep liquor as the organic nitrogen source and high glucose concentrations. 
23180124	20121127	Folia_Microbiol._(Praha)	D016428 D013485 	Molecular characterization of β-fructofuranosidases from Rhizopus delemar and Amylomyces rouxii.	Of the 19 strains of Rhizopus delemar deposited as Rhizopus oryzae, seven of them, NBRC 4726, NBRC 4734, NBRC 4746, NBRC 4754, NBRC 4773, NBRC 4775, and NBRC 4801, completely hydrolyzed exogenous sucrose and fructooligosaccharides. The sucrose-hydrolyzing enzyme was purified from the culture filtrate of R. delemar NBRC 4754 and classified to β-fructofuranosidase, similar to that of Amylomyces rouxii CBS 438.76. Fragments including β-fructofuranosidase genes (sucA) of seven strains of R. delemar and A. rouxii CBS 438.76 were amplified and sequenced by PCR with degenerated primers synthesized on the basis of the internal amino acid sequences of purified enzymes and successive inverse PCR. Nucleotide sequences of the obtained fragments revealed that open reading frames of 1,569 bp have no intron and encode 522 amino acids. The presumed proteins contained the typical domain of the glycoside hydrolase 32 family, including β-fructofuranosidase, inulinase, levanase, and fructosyltransferases. Amino acid sequences of SucA proteins from the seven strains of R. delemar were identical and showed 90.0 % identity with those of A. rouxii CBS 438.76. A dendrogram constructed from these amino acid sequences showed that SucA proteins are more closely related to yeast β-fructofuranosidases than to other fungal enzymes. 
9237400	19970801	Phytochemistry	D016428 D013485 	Detection of tomatinase from Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici in infected tomato plants.	The antifungal glycoalkaloid alpha-tomatine of the tomato plant (Lycopersicon esculentum) is proposed to protect the plant against phytopathogenic fungi. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, a vascular pathogen of tomato, produces a tomatinase enzyme which hydrolyses the glycoalkaloid into non-fungitoxic compounds. Detoxification of alpha-tomatine may be how this fungus avoids the plant glycoalkaloid barrier. As an initial step to evaluate this possibility we have studied the induction of tomatinase; (i) in fungal cultures containing extracts from leaf, stem or root of tomato plants; and (ii) in stem and root of tomato plants infected with the pathogen at different infection stages. The kinetics of tomatinase induction with leaf extract (0.6% dry weight) was similar to that observed with 20 micrograms ml-1 of alpha-tomatine. In the presence of stem extract, tomatinase activity was less than 50% of that induced with leaf extract, whereas in the presence of root extract tomatinase activity was very low. In the stem of infected tomato plants tomatinase activity was higher at the wilt stage than in previous infections stages and in root, tomatinase activity appeared with the first symptoms and was maintained until wilting. TLC analysis showed that the tomatinase induced in culture medium with plant extracts and in infected tomato plants had the same mode of action as the enzyme induced with pure alpha-tomatine, hydrolysing the glycoalkaloid into its non-fungitoxic forms, tomatidine and beta-lycotetraose. The antisera raised against purified tomatinase recognized in extracts of root and stem of infected tomato plants a protein of 50000 (45000 when proteins were deglycosylated), corresponding to the tomatinase enzyme. Therefore, it is concluded that F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici express tomatinase in vivo as a result of the infection of tomato plant. 
8297343	19940115	Biochem._J.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Intronless celB from the anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum encodes a modular family A endoglucanase.	The cDNA designated celB from the anaerobic rumen fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum contained a single open reading frame of 1422 bp coding for a protein (CelB) of M(r) 53,070. CelB expressed by Escherichia coli harbouring the full-length gene hydrolysed carboxymethylcellulose in the manner of an endoglucanase, but was most active against barley beta-glucan. It also released reducing sugar from xylan and lichenan, but was inactive against crystalline cellulose, laminarin, mannan, galactan and arabinan. The rate of hydrolysis of cellulo-oligosaccharides by CelB increased with increasing chain length from cellotriose to cellopentaose. The predicted structure of CelB contained features indicative of modular structure. The first 360 residues of CelB constituted a fully functional catalytic domain that was homologous with bacterial endoglucanases belonging to cellulase family A, including five which originate from three different species of anaerobic rumen bacteria. Downstream from this domain, and linked to it by a serine/threonine-rich hinge, was a non-catalytic domain containing short tandem repeats, homologous to the C-terminal repeats contained in xylanase A from the same anaerobic fungus. Unlike previous fungal cellulases, genomic celB was devoid of introns. This lack of introns and the homology of its encoded product with rumen bacterial endoglucanases suggest that acquisition of celB by the fungus may at some stage have involved horizontal gene transfer from a prokaryote to N. particiarum.

The cbhI gene from T. viride AS3.3711 contains 1,542 nucleotides and encodes a 514-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 53.96 kDa. The cbhII gene from T. viride CICC 13038 was 1,413 bp in length encoding 471 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of approximately 49.55 kDa. The CBHI protein showed high homology with enzymes belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 7 and CBHII is a member of Glycoside hydrolase family 6. CBHI and CBHII play a role in the conversion of cellulose to glucose by cutting the disaccharide cellobiose from the non-reducing end of the cellulose polymer chain. The two cellobiohydrolase (CBHI, CBHII) genes were successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae H158. Maximal activities of transformants Sc-cbhI and Sc-cbhII were 0.03 and 0.089 units ml(-1) under galactose induction, respectively. The optimal temperatures of the recombinant enzymes (CBHI, CBHII) were 60 and 70 degrees C, respectively. The optimal pHs of recombinant enzymes CBHI and CBHII were at pH 5.8 and 5.0, respectively. 
18307762	20080301	BMC_Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Towards a molecular understanding of symbiont function: identification of a fungal gene for the degradation of xylan in the fungus gardens of leaf-cutting ants.	Leaf-cutting ants live in symbiosis with a fungus that they rear for food by providing it with live plant material. Until recently the fungus' main inferred function was to make otherwise inaccessible cell wall degradation products available to the ants, but new studies have shed doubt on this idea. To provide evidence for the cell wall degrading capacity of the attine ant symbiont, we designed PCR primers from conserved regions of known xylanase genes, to be used in PCR with genomic DNA from the symbiont as template. We also measured xylanase, cellulase and proteinase activities in the fungus gardens in order to investigate the dynamics of degradation activities. We cloned a xylanase gene from the mutualistic fungus of Acromyrmex echinatior, determined its protein sequence, and inserted it in a yeast expression vector to confirm its substrate specificity. Our results show that the fungus has a functional xylanase gene. We also show by lab experiments in vivo that the activity of fungal xylanase and cellulase is not evenly distributed, but concentrated in the lower layer of fungus gardens, with only modest activity in the middle layer where gongylidia are produced and intermediate activity in the newly established top layer. This vertical distribution appears to be negatively correlated with the concentration of glucose, which indicates a directly regulating role of glucose, as has been found in other fungi and has been previously suggested for the ant fungal symbiont. The mutualistic fungus of Acromyrmex echinatior has a functional xylanase gene and is thus presumably able to at least partially degrade the cell walls of leaves. This finding supports a saprotrophic origin of the fungal symbiont. The observed distribution of enzyme activity leads us to propose that leaf-substrate degradation in fungus gardens is a multi-step process comparable to normal biodegradation of organic matter in soil ecosystems, but with the crucial difference that a single fungal symbiont realizes most of the steps that are normally provided by a series of microorganisms that colonize fallen leaves in a distinct succession. 
23356577	20130130	Biochemistry	D016428 D052061 D013485 	Oxidation mode of pyranose 2-oxidase is controlled by pH.	Pyranose 2-oxidase (P2O) from Trametes multicolor is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of d-glucose and other aldopyranose sugars at the C2 position by using O₂ as an electron acceptor to form the corresponding 2-keto-sugars and H₂O₂. In this study, the effects of pH on the oxidative half-reaction of P2O were investigated using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The results showed that flavin oxidation occurred via different pathways depending on the pH of the environment. At pH values lower than 8.0, reduced P2O reacts with O₂ to form a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate, leading to elimination of H₂O₂. At pH 8.0 and higher, the majority of the reduced P2O reacts with O₂ via a pathway that does not allow detection of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, and flavin oxidation occurs with decreased rate constants upon the rise in pH. The switching between the two modes of P2O oxidation is controlled by protonation of a group which has a pK(a) of 7.6 ± 0.1. Oxidation reactions of reduced P2O under rapid pH change as performed by stopped-flow mixing were different from the same reactions performed with enzyme pre-equilibrated at the same specified pH values, implying that the protonation of the group which controls the mode of flavin oxidation cannot be rapidly equilibrated with outside solvent. Using a double-mixing stopped-flow experiment, a rate constant for proton dissociation from the reaction site was determined to be 21.0 ± 0.4 s⁻¹.

F75: gene cloning, expression, and enzymatic characterization.	A novel alpha-galactosidase gene (aga-F75) from Gibberella sp. F75 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene codes for a protein of 744 amino acids with a 24-residue putative signal peptide and a calculated molecular mass of 82.94 kDa. The native structure of the recombinant Aga-F75 was estimated to be a trimer or tetramer. The deduced amino acid sequence showed highest identity (69%) with an alpha-galactosidase from Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei), a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 36. Purified recombinant Aga-F75 was optimally active at 60 degrees C and pH 4.0 and was stable at pH 3.0-12.0. The enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificity and substantial resistance to neutral and alkaline proteases. The enzyme K (m) values using pNPG, melibiose, stachyose, and raffinose as substrates were 1.06, 1.75, 54.26, and 8.23 mM, respectively. Compared with the commercial alpha-galactosidase (Aga-A) from Aspergillus niger var. AETL and a protease-resistant alpha-galactosidase (Aga-F78) from Rhizopus sp. F78, Aga-F75 released 1.4- and 4.9-fold more galactose from soybean meal alone, respectively, and 292.5- and 8.6-fold more galactose from soybean meal in the presence of trypsin, respectively. The pH and thermal stability and hydrolytic activity of Aga-F75 make it potentially useful in the food and feed industries. 
8670100	19960401	Biochem._J.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Expression of lignin peroxidase H8 in Escherichia coli: folding and activation of the recombinant enzyme with Ca2+ and haem.	An engineered cDNA from Phanerochaete chrysosporium encoding both the mature and pro-sequence regions of Lip isoenzyme H8 (Lip) has been successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein (LipP*) was sequestered in inclusion bodies. The reduced-denatured polypeptide has been purified by differential solubilization, and the active enzyme recovered after controlled in vitro refolding (albeit in low yield), by glutathione-mediated oxidation of disulphides, in a folding medium containing an intermediate concentration of urea, Ca2+, and haem. The procedure is analogous to that previously described for the production of active recombinant horseradish peroxidase (HRP-C*) from inclusion-body material. It is quite possible, therefore, that this type of procedure may be suitable for the recovery of most, if not all, active recombinant peroxidases. The resultant LipP* has spectral characteristics identical with that of the native enzyme as isolated from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Its specific activity measured in the standard veratryl alcohol (VA) assay was 39 micromol of VA oxidized/min per mg of protein, a value which compares extremely favourably with that of the native enzyme (36 micromol of VA/min per mg). Although levels of active enzyme obtained are not yet as high as in the case of HRP-C* (1% conversion of crude inactive LipP* polypeptide into pure fully active Lip), it is envisaged that further refinement of the expression/folding/activation procedures will provide sufficient protein for biophysical characterization of both the wild-type and site-directed mutants.

D003160 D016428 D013485 	Expression of the Aspergillus aculeatus endo-beta-1,4-mannanase encoding gene (man1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterization of the recombinant enzyme.	The endo-beta-1,4-mannanase encoding gene man1 of Aspergillus aculeatus MRC11624 was amplified from mRNA by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers designed from the published sequence of man1 from A. aculeatus KSM510. The amplified fragment was cloned and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the gene regulation of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2(PT)) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1(PT)) promoters and terminators, respectively. The man1 gene product was designated Man5A. Subsequently, the FUR1 gene of the recombinant yeast strains was disrupted to create autoselective strains: S. cerevisiae Man5ADH2 and S. cerevisiae Man5PGK1. The strains secreted 521 nkat/ml and 379 nkat/ml of active Man5A after 96 h of growth in a complex medium. These levels were equivalent to 118 and 86 mg/l of Man5A protein produced, respectively. The properties of the native and recombinant Man5A were investigated and found to be similar. The apparent molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was 50 kDa compared to 45 kDa of the native enzyme due to glycosylation. The determined K(m) and V(max) values were 0.3 mg/ml and 82 micromol/min/mg for the recombinant and 0.15 mg/ml and 180 micromol/min/mg for the native Man5A, respectively. The maximum pH and thermal stability were observed within the range of pH 4-6 and 50 degrees C and below. The pH and temperature optima and stability were relatively similar for recombinant and native Man5A. Hydrolysis of an unbranched beta-1,4-linked mannan polymer released mannose, mannobiose, and mannotriose as the main products. 
22353731	20120223	Microb._Cell_Fact.	D016428 D013485 	L-rhamnose induction of Aspergillus nidulans α-L-rhamnosidase genes is glucose repressed via a CreA-independent mechanism acting at the level of inducer uptake.	Little is known about the structure and regulation of fungal α-L-rhamnosidase genes despite increasing interest in the biotechnological potential of the enzymes that they encode. Whilst the paradigmatic filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans growing on L-rhamnose produces an α-L-rhamnosidase suitable for oenological applications, at least eight genes encoding putative α-L-rhamnosidases have been found in its genome. In the current work we have identified the gene (rhaE) encoding the former activity, and characterization of its expression has revealed a novel regulatory mechanism. A shared pattern of expression has also been observed for a second α-L-rhamnosidase gene, (AN10277/rhaA). Amino acid sequence data for the oenological α-L-rhamnosidase were determined using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and correspond to the amino acid sequence deduced from AN7151 (rhaE). The cDNA of rhaE was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and yielded pNP-rhamnohydrolase activity. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed this eukaryotic α-L-rhamnosidase to be the first such enzyme found to be more closely related to bacterial rhamnosidases than other α-L-rhamnosidases of fungal origin. Northern analyses of diverse A. nidulans strains cultivated under different growth conditions indicate that rhaA and rhaE are induced by L-rhamnose and repressed by D-glucose as well as other carbon sources, some of which are considered to be non-repressive growth substrates. Interestingly, the transcriptional repression is independent of the wide domain carbon catabolite repressor CreA. Gene induction and glucose repression of these rha genes correlate with the uptake, or lack of it, of the inducing carbon source L-rhamnose, suggesting a prominent role for inducer exclusion in repression. The A. nidulans rhaE gene encodes an α-L-rhamnosidase phylogenetically distant to those described in filamentous fungi, and its expression is regulated by a novel CreA-independent mechanism. The identification of rhaE and the characterization of its regulation will facilitate the design of strategies to overproduce the encoded enzyme - or homologs from other fungi - for industrial applications. Moreover, A. nidulans α-L-rhamnosidase encoding genes could serve as prototypes for fungal genes coding for plant cell wall degrading enzymes regulated by a novel mechanism of CCR.

To express a gene encoding a heterologous fungal xylanase in Trichoderma reesei. Humicola grisea xylanase 2 (xyn2) cDNA was expressed in Trichoderma reesei under the main cellobiohydrolase I (cbh1) promoter (i) as a fusion to the cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) secretion signal and (ii) the mature CBHI core-linker. The recombinant xylanase (HXYN2) was secreted into the cultivation medium and processed in a similar fashion to the endogenous T. reesei xylanases, resulting in an active enzyme. HXYN2 was successfully processed in T. reesei. Composition of the culture medium affected the HXYN2 yields, favouring Avicel-lactose as a carbon source. Best yields (about 0.5 g l(-1)) in shake flask cultivations were obtained from a transformant where xyn2 was fused directly to the CBHI secretion signal. 
7640003	19950715	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Penicillium purpurogenum produces several xylanases: purification and properties of two of the enzymes.	The fungus Penicillium purpurogenum produces several extracellular xylanases. The two major forms (xylanases A and B) have been purified and characterized. After ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography in Bio-Gel P 100, xylanase A was further purified by means of DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite and CM-Sephadex, and xylanase B by DEAE-cellulose and CM-Sephadex. Both xylanases showed apparent homogeneity in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Xylanase A (33 kDa) has an isoelectric point of 8.6, while xylanase B (23 kDa) is isoelectric at pH 5.9. Antisera against both enzymes do not cross-react. The amino terminal sequences of xylanases A and B show no homology. The results obtained suggest that the enzymes are produced by separate genes and they may perform different functions in xylan degradation. 
18633609	20080718	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Characterization of an alpha-L-rhamnosidase from Aspergillus kawachii and its gene.	An alpha-L-rhamnosidase was purified by fractionating a culture filtrate of Aspergillus kawachii grown on L-rhamnose as the sole carbon source. The alpha-L-rhamnosidase had a molecular mass of 90 kDa and a high degree of N-glycosylation of approximately 22%. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH 4.0 and temperature of 50 degrees C. Further, it was observed to be thermostable, and it retained more than 80% of its original activity following incubation at 60 degrees C for 1 h. Its T (50) value was determined to be 72 degrees C. The enzyme was able to hydrolyze alpha-1,2- and alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds. The specific activity of the enzyme was higher toward naringin than toward hesperidin. The A. kawachii alpha-L-rhamnosidase-encoding gene (Ak-rhaA) codes for a 655-amino-acid protein. Based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA, the protein possessed 13 potential N-glycosylation recognition sites and exhibited a high degree of sequence identity (up to 75%) with the alpha-L-rhamnosidases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 78 from Aspergillus aculeatus and with hypothetical Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus fumigatus proteins.

Aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO) involved in lignin degradation by Pleurotus pulmonarius has been purified and characterized. The enzyme was produced in glucose-peptone medium and isolated in a sole chromatographic step using Sephacryl S-200. The purified enzyme is an extracellular glycoprotein with 14% N-carbohydrate content and an estimated molecular mass of 70.5 kDa and pI of 3.95. The kinetic studies showed the highest enzyme affinity against p-anisyl alcohol, with constants similar to those of Pleurotus eryngii and Bjerkandera adusta AAO but different from the intracellular AAO described in Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which present the highest activity on m-anisyl alcohol. Simultaneously, the cDNA of P. pulmonarius AAO has been cloned and sequenced. The translation of this sequence consisted of 593 amino acids including a signal peptide of 27 amino acids. The comparison with other alcohol oxidases, 35% amino acid identity with glucose oxidase, showed highly conserved amino acid sequences in N-terminal and C-terminal regions, in spite of differences in substrate specificity. Crystallization of AAO, carried out for the first time using the P. pulmonarius enzyme, will permit to obtain a molecular model for this oxidase and establish some characteristic of its catalytic site and general structure. 
20562106	20100622	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a new multigene family encoding isomaltases in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the IMA family.	It has been known for a long time that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can assimilate alpha-methylglucopyranoside and isomaltose. We here report the identification of 5 genes (YGR287c, YIL172c, YJL216c, YJL221c and YOL157c), which, similar to the SUCx, MALx, or HXTx multigene families, are located in the subtelomeric regions of different chromosomes. They share high nucleotide sequence identities between themselves (66-100%) and with the MALx2 genes (63-74%). Comparison of their amino acid sequences underlined a substitution of threonine by valine in region II, one of the four highly conserved regions of the alpha-glucosidase family. This change was previously shown to be sufficient to discriminate alpha-1,4- to alpha-1,6-glucosidase activity in YGR287c (Yamamoto, K., Nakayama, A., Yamamoto, Y., and Tabata, S. (2004) Eur. J. Biochem. 271, 3414-3420). We showed that each of these five genes encodes a protein with alpha-glucosidase activity on isomaltose, and we therefore renamed these genes IMA1 to IMA5 for IsoMAltase. Our results also illustrated that sequence polymorphisms among this family led to interesting variability of gene expression patterns and of catalytic efficiencies on different substrates, which altogether should account for the absence of functional redundancy for growth on isomaltose. Indeed, deletion studies revealed that IMA1/YGR287c encodes the major isomaltase and that growth on isomaltose required the presence of AGT1, which encodes an alpha-glucoside transporter. Expressions of IMA1 and IMA5/YJL216c were strongly induced by maltose, isomaltose, and alpha-methylglucopyranoside, in accordance with their regulation by the Malx3p-transcription system. The physiological relevance of this IMAx multigene family in S. cerevisiae is discussed.

A cDNA library of Paecilomyces thermophila was constructed, and the gene encoding xylanase (designated Pt xynA) was isolated from the library. Pt xynA consisted of 681 bp, and the translated protein encoded 226 amino acids. This is the first functional gene cloned from P. thermophila. The gene was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and the recombinant xylanase (XynA) was purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA and Sephadex G50. XynA showed an optimum activity at 75 degrees C and pH 7.0. Its residual activity was more than 60% after being treated at 85 degrees C for 30 min. K(m) values of XynA for birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan and oat-spelt xylan were 4.4, 3.6 and 9.7 mg ml(-1), respectively. The enzyme has an endohydrolytic mode of action and can hydrolyse xylotriose to xylobiose through transglycosylation. These results indicate the XynA is a thermostable enzyme and has great potential in various industries.

The study presents variation in microbial population of Agaricus bisporus, Pleurotus sajor-caju and Volvariella volvacea spent substrates (SMS) along with ligninolytic enzymes activity and textile effluent decolorization potential of microorganisms isolated from these. The effect of temperature, pH, carbon sources and immobilizing agents on effluent decolorization using different combinations of these microorganisms has also been studied. SMS of P. sajor-caju harbored highest population and diversity of bacteria and fungi compared to other SMSs.

Yeast cells expressing the lacA gene from the yeast ADH1 promotor on a multicopy plasmid secrete up to 40% of the total beta-galactosidase activity into the growth medium. The secreted product is extensively N-glycosylated, and cells expressing the lacA gene grow on whey permeate (4% w/v lactose) with a doubling time of 1.6 hours. Such strains may offer a solution to the increasing problem of waste whey disposal.

A gene (PGN1) encoding extracellular endopolygalacturonase was isolated from the fungal maize pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum race 1. A probe was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides based on the endopolygalacturonase amino acid sequence. Genomic and cDNA copies of the gene were isolated and sequenced. The corresponding mRNA was present in C. carbonum grown on pectin but not on sucrose as carbon source. The single copy of PGN1 in C. carbonum was disrupted by homologous integration of a plasmid containing an internal fragment of the gene. Polygalacturonase activity in one transformant chosen for further analysis was 10% or 35% of the wild-type activity based on viscometric or reducing sugar assays, respectively. End product analysis indicated that the residual activity in the mutant was due to an exopolygalacturonase. Pathogenicity on maize of the mutant lacking endopolygalacturonase activity was qualitatively indistinguishable from the wild-type strain, indicating that in this disease interaction endopolygalacturonase is not required. Either pectin degradation is not critical to this interaction or exopolygalacturonase alone is sufficient.

An enzyme with mannosyl glycoprotein endo-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (ENGase)-type activity was partially purified from the extracellular medium of the mould Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei). Internal peptides were generated and used to identify the gene in the T. reesei genome. The active enzyme is processed both at the N- and at the C-terminus. High-mannose-type glycoproteins are good substrates, whereas complex-type glycans are not hydrolysed. The enzyme represents the first fungal member of glycoside hydrolase family 18 with ENGase-type activity. Bacterial ENGases and the fungal chitinases belonging to the same family show very low homology with Endo T. Database searches identify several highly homologous genes in fungi and the activity is also found within other Trichoderma species. This ENGase activity, not coregulated with cellulase production, could be responsible for the extensive N-deglycosylation observed for several T. reesei cellulases.

A new component of the beta-1,6-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.75) multienzymatic complex secreted by Trichoderma harzianum has been identified and fully characterized. The protein, namely BGN16.3, is the third isozyme displaying endo-beta-1,6-glucanase activity described up to now in T. harzianum CECT 2413. BGN16.3 is an acidic beta-1,6-glucanase that is specifically induced by the presence of fungal cell walls in T. harzianum growth media. The protein was purified to electrophoretical homogenity using its affinity to beta-1,6-glucan as first purification step, followed by chomatofocusing and gel filtration. BGN16.3 has a molecular mass of 46 kDa in SDS/PAGE and a pI of 4.5. The enzyme only showed activity against substrates with beta-1,6-glycosidic linkages, and it has an endohydrolytic mode of action as shown by HPLC analysis of the products of pustulan hydrolysis. The expression profile analysis of BGN16.3 showed a carbon source control of the accumulation of the enzyme, which is fast and strongly induced by fungal cell walls, a condition often regarded as mycoparasitic simulation. The likely involvement beta-1,6-glucanases in this process is discussed. 
16520923	20060308	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Cloning, functional expression and promoter analysis of xylanase III gene from Trichoderma reesei.	In this study, the xyn3 gene from the filamentous mesophilic fungus Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) PC-3-7 was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of XYN III revealed considerable homology with xylanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 10. These results show that XYN III is distinguishable from XYN I and XYN II, two other T. reesei xylanases that belong to the glycosidase family 11. When xyn3 was expressed in Escherichia coli, significant activity was observed in the cell-free extract, and higher activity (13.2 U/ml medium) was recovered from the inclusion bodies in the cell debris. The sequence of the 5'-upstream region of the gene in the parent strain QM9414 is identical to that of PC-3-7, although the expression level of xyn3 in PC-3-7 has been reported to be at least 1,000 times greater than in QM9414. These results suggest that xyn3 expression in T. reesei QM9414 is silenced. The consensus sequences for ACEI, ACEII, CREI, and the Hap2/3/5 protein complex are all present in the upstream region of xyn3. Deletion analysis of the upstream region revealed that two regions containing consensus sequences for the known regulatory elements play important roles for xyn3 expression. 
1576150	19920417	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Comparison of structure and activities of peroxidases from Coprinus cinereus, Coprinus macrorhizus and Arthromyces ramosus.	Initial structural and kinetic data suggested that peroxidases from Coprinus cinereus, Coprinus macrorhizus and Arthromyces ramosus were similar. Therefore they were characterized more fully. The three peroxidases were purified to RZ 2.5 and showed immunochemical identity as well as an identical M(r) of 38,000, pI about 3.5 and similar amino acid compositions. The N-termini were blocked for amino acid sequencing. The peroxidases had similar retention volumes by anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. All peroxidases showed multiple peaks by Concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography. The Concanavalin A-Sepharose profiles were different and depended furthermore on a fermentation batch. Tryptic peptide maps were very similar except for one peptide. This peptide contained an N-linked glycan composed of varying ratios of glucosamine and mannose for the three peroxidases. Rate constants and their pH dependence were the same for the three peroxidases using guaiacol or iodide as reducing substrates. We conclude that peroxidases from Coprinus cinereus, Coprinus macrorhizus and Arthromyces ramosus are most likely identical in their amino acid sequences, but deviate in glycosylation which, apparently, has no influence on the reaction rates of the enzyme. We suggest, that the Coprinus fungi express one peroxidase only in contrast to the lignin-degrading white-rot Basidiomycetes, which produce multiple peroxidase isozymes.

Fungal cellobiohydrolases are unique enzymes capable of degrading highly ordered crystalline cellulose. We present here the isolation and complete sequence analysis of the chromosomal and cDNA copies of the structural gene (cbh2) coding for one of the major cellobiohydrolases (CBH II) of Trichoderma reesei. We also present data on expression of the cbh2 gene and show that the transcription start points of the cbh2 gene are heterogeneous and are located 32 to 52 bp downstream from a putative TATA box. The derived CBH II protein sequence is 471 amino acids long and the coding region is interrupted by three short introns. Most of the CBH II protein bears no apparent resemblance to CBH I and endoglucanase I. However, a short region of extensive homology is found in all Trichoderma cellulases characterized so far, suggesting that this region is important for cellulose hydrolysis. The implications of this information with regard to the evolution of fungal cellulase genes and the enzymology of cellulose hydrolysis are discussed.

The mature LiP cDNA was cloned into the pET vector and used to transform Escherichia coli. Recombinant LiP protein accumulated in inclusion bodies as an inactive form. Refolding conditions for its in vitro activation-including incorporation of heme and structural Ca2+ ions, and formation of disulfide bridges-were optimized taking as a starting point those reported for other plant and fungal peroxidases. The absorption spectrum of the refolded enzyme was identical to that of wild LiP from T. cervina suggesting that it was properly folded. The enzyme was able to oxidize 1,4-dimethoxybenzene and ferrocytochrome c confirming its high redox potential and ability to oxidize large substrates. However, during oxidation of veratryl alcohol (VA), the physiological LiP substrate, an unexpected initial lag period was observed. Possible modification of the enzyme was investigated by incubating it with H2O2 and VA (for 30 min before dialysis). The pretreated enzyme showed normal kinetics traces for VA oxidation, without the initial lag previously observed. Steady-state kinetics of the pretreated LiP were almost the same as the recombinant enzyme before the pretreatment. Moreover, the catalytic constant (k(cat)) for VA oxidation was comparable to that of wild LiP from T. cervina, although the Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) was 8-fold higher. The present heterologous expression system provides a valuable tool to investigate structure-function relationships, and autocatalytic activation of the unique T. cervina LiP. 
18377882	20080402	Carbohydr._Res.	D016428 	Properties of family 79 beta-glucuronidases that hydrolyze beta-glucuronosyl and 4-O-methyl-beta-glucuronosyl residues of arabinogalactan-protein.	The carbohydrate moieties of arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs), which are mainly composed of Gal, L-Ara, GlcA, and 4-Me-GlcA residues, are essential for the physiological functions of these proteoglycans in higher plants. For this study, we have identified two genes encoding family 79 beta-glucuronidases, designated AnGlcAase and NcGlcAase, in Aspergillus niger and Neurospora crassa, respectively, based on the amino acid sequence of a native beta-glucuronidase purified from a commercial pectolytic enzyme preparation from A. niger. Although the deduced protein sequences of AnGlcAase and NcGlcAase were highly similar, the recombinant enzymes expressed in Pichia pastoris exhibited distinct substrate specificity toward 4-Me-GlcA residues of AGPs: recombinant AnGlcAase (rAnGlcAase) substantially liberated both GlcA and 4-Me-GlcA residues from radish AGPs, whereas recombinant NcGlcAase (rNcGlcAase) activity on the 4-Me-GlcA residues of AGPs was very low. Maximum activity of rAnGlcAase hydrolyzing PNP beta-GlcA occurred at pH 3.0-4.0, whereas the maximum rNcGlcAase activity was at pH 6.0. The apparent Km values of rAnGlcAase were 30.4 microM for PNP beta-GlcA and 422 microM for beta-GlcA-(1-->6)-Gal, and those of rNcGlcAase were 38.3 microM and 378 microM, respectively. Similar to the native enzyme, rAnGlcAase was able to catalyze the transglycosylation of GlcA residues from PNP beta-GlcA to various monosaccharide acceptors such as Glc, Gal, and Xyl. We propose that both AnGlcAase and NcGlcAase are instances of a novel type of beta-glucuronidase with the capacity to hydrolyze beta-GlcA and 4-Me-beta-GlcA residues of AGPs, although they differ significantly in their preferences. 
22033931	20111029	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013486 	Biochemical and molecular characterization of secreted α-xylosidase from Aspergillus niger.	α-Linked xylose is a major component of xyloglucans in the cell walls of higher plants. An α-xylosidase (AxlA) was purified from a commercial enzyme preparation from Aspergillus niger, and the encoding gene was identified. The protein is a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 31. It was active on p-nitrophenyl-α-d-xyloside, isoprimeverose, xyloglucan heptasaccharide (XXXG), and tamarind xyloglucan. When expressed in Pichia pastoris, AxlA had activity comparable to the native enzyme on pNPαX and IP despite apparent hyperglycosylation. The pH optimum of AxlA was between 3.0 and 4.0. AxlA together with β-glucosidase depolymerized xyloglucan heptasaccharide. A combination of AxlA, β-glucosidase, xyloglucanase, and β-galactosidase in the optimal proportions of 51:5:19:25 or 59:5:11:25 could completely depolymerize tamarind XG to free Glc or Xyl, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a secreted microbial α-xylosidase. Secreted α-xylosidases appear to be rare in nature, being absent from other tested commercial enzyme mixtures and from the genomes of most filamentous fungi. 
16650812	20060503	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 	Substrate specificity of Aspergillus oryzae family 3 beta-glucosidase.	Among glycoside hydrolases, beta-glucosidase plays a unique role in many physiological and biocatalytical processes that involve the beta-linked O-glycosyl bond of various oligomeric saccharides or glycosides. Structurally, the enzyme can be grouped into glycoside hydrolase family 1 and 3. Although the basic ("retaining, double-displacement") mechanism for the catalysis of family 3 beta-glucosidase has been established, in-depth understanding of its structure-function relationship, particularly the substrate specificity that is of great interest for developing the enzyme as a versatile biocatalyst, remains limited. To further probe the active site, we carried out a comparative study on a family 3 beta-glucosidase from Aspergillus oryzae with substrates and competitive inhibitors of different structures, in attempt to evaluate the site-specific spatial and chemical interactions between a pyranosyl substrate and the enzyme. Our results showed the enzyme having a strict stereochemical requirement (to accommodate beta-d-glucopyranose) for its "-1" active subsite, in contrast to its family 1 counterpart. 
16636831	20060426	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Cloning and heterologous expression of the exo-beta-D-glucosaminidase-encoding gene (gls93) from a filamentous fungus, Trichoderma reesei PC-3-7.	We have previously reported on purification and characterization of an exo-beta-D-glucosaminidase (Gls93) from culture filtrate of Trichoderma reesei PC-3-7 grown on N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). The corresponding gene of Gls93 was cloned and characterized in this work. To our knowledge, this is the first report on cloning of the gene encoding fungal exo-beta-D-glucosaminidase. This gene has no introns and encodes a polypeptide of 892 amino acids (aa) containing a secretion signal of 28 amino acids. Comparison of the amino acid sequence to known proteins and phylogenetic analysis indicated that gls93 belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family (GHF) 2 and should be further classified into a new subgroup, exo-beta-D-glucosaminidase subgroup. The gls93 transcription was biphasic when T. reesei was grown on GlcNAc, suggesting that the expression of this gene may be regulated by a complex mechanism, in which multiple regulatory proteins are involved. Furthermore, gls93 could be expressed in Pichia pastoris (ca. 0.49-mg/ml culture). The recombinant Gls93 had the two molecular forms, ca. 105 and 100 kDa, whose difference is caused by N-glycosylation. Both of them had the same properties such as specific activity and substrate specificity and showed only the activity of exo-beta-D-glucosaminidase but not those of beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and beta-mannosidase belonging to GHF2. 
9742698	19980922	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and characterization of a chitinase cDNA from the entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae.	A novel chitinase gene was isolated from Metarhizium anisopliae grown in a medium containing chitin as the sole carbon source. Comparisons of nucleotide sequence of the isolated gene with those of other fungal chitinase genes showed low sequence identity (24.4-36.4%) except for the active site of chitinase. In addition, molecular mass determination of the fused gene product separated on a gel showed that the fused chitinase seems to be about 70 kDa, while the molecular mass calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence can be about 58 kDa. These molecular masses were different from values of 33 kDa for an endochitinase and 110 kDa for an exochitinase (N-acetylglucosaminidase) from M. anisopliae published previously. 
21306947	20110211	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and characterization of a β-glucanase from Piromyces rhizinflatus.	Cellulose is the most abundant renewable polysaccharide with a high potential for degradation to useful end products. In nature, most cellulose is produced as crystalline cellulose. Therefore, cellulases with high hydrolytic activity against crystalline cellulose are of great interest. In this study, a crystalline cellulose degradation enzyme was investigated. The cDNA encoding a β-glucanase, CbhYW23-2, was cloned from the ruminal fungus Piromyces rhizinflatus. To examine the enzyme activities, CbhYW23-2 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a recombinant His(6) fusion protein and purified by immobilized metal ion-affinity chromatography. Response surface modeling (RSM) combined with central composite design (CCD) and regression analysis was then employed for the planned statistical optimization of the β-glucanase activities of CbhYW23-2. The optimal conditions for the highest β-glucanase activity of CbhYW23-2 were observed at 46.4°C and pH 6.0. The results suggested that RSM combined with CCD and regression analysis were effective in determining optimized temperature and pH conditions for the enzyme activity of CbhYW23-2. CbhYW23-2 also showed hydrolytic activities toward Avicel, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), lichenan, and pachyman. The results also proved that the high activity of CbhYW23-2 on crystalline cellulose makes it a promising candidate enzyme for biotechnological and industrial applications.

D016428 D013485 	Substrate and product hydrolysis specificity in family 11 glycoside hydrolases: an analysis of Penicillium funiculosum and Penicillium griseofulvum xylanases.	Two genes encoding family 11 endo-(1,4)-beta-xylanases from Penicillium griseofulvum (PgXynA) and Penicillium funiculosum (PfXynC) were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and the recombinant enzymes were purified after affinity chromatography and proteolysis. PgXynA and PfXynC were identical to their native counterparts in terms of molecular mass, pI, N-terminal sequence, optimum pH, and enzymatic activity towards arabinoxylan. Further investigation of the rate and pattern of hydrolysis of PgXynA and PfXynC on wheat soluble arabinoxylan showed the predominant production of xylotriose and xylobiose as end products. The initial rate data from the hydrolysis of short xylo-oligosaccharides indicated that the catalytic efficiency increased with increasing chain length (n) of oligomer up to n = 6, suggesting that the specificity region of both Penicillium xylanases spans about six xylose units. In contrast to PfXynC, PgXynA was found insensitive to the wheat xylanase inhibitor protein XIP-I. 
21564548	20110514	FEBS_J.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Enzymatic characterization and molecular modeling of an evolutionarily interesting fungal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase.	Fungal β-N-acetylhexosaminidases are inducible extracellular enzymes with many biotechnological applications. The enzyme from Penicillium oxalicum has unique enzymatic properties despite its close evolutionary relationship with other fungal hexosaminidases. It has high GalNAcase activity, tolerates substrates with the modified N-acyl group better and has some other unusual catalytic properties. In order to understand these features, we performed isolation, biochemical and enzymological characterization, molecular cloning and molecular modelling. The native enzyme is composed of two catalytic units (65 kDa each) and two propeptides (15 kDa each), yielding a molecular weight of 160 kDa. Enzyme deglycosylated by endoglycosidase H had comparable activity, but reduced stability. We have cloned and sequenced the gene coding for the entire hexosaminidase from P. oxalicum. Sufficient sequence identity of this hexosaminidase with the structurally solved enzymes from bacteria and humans with complete conservation of all catalytic residues allowed us to construct a molecular model of the enzyme. Results from molecular dynamics simulations and substrate docking supported the experimental kinetic and substrate specificity data and provided a molecular explanation for why the hexosaminidase from P. oxalicum is unique among the family of fungal hexosaminidases. 
7670182	19950701	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of a gene coding for Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase.	To understand the relationship between the structure and functions of the peroxidase of Arthromyces ramosus, a novel taxon of hyphomycete, and the evolutionary relationship of the A.ramosus peroxidase (ARP) with the other peroxidases, we isolated complementary and genomic DNA clones encoding ARP and characterized them. The sequence analyses of the ARP and cDNA coding for ARP showed that a mature ARP consists of 344 amino acids with a N-terminal pyroglutamic acid preceded by a signal peptide of 20 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of ARP was 99% identical to that of the peroxidase of Coprinus cinereus, a basidiomycete, and also had very high similarities (41-43% identity) to those of basidiomycetous lignin peroxidases, although we could find no lignin peroxidase activities for ARP when assayed with lignin model compounds. We could identified His184 and His56 as proximal and distal ligands to heme, respectively, and Arg52 as an essential Arg. Comparison of the sequences of complementary and genomic DNAs found that protein-encoding DNA is interrupted by 14 intervening sequences. The ARP cDNA was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the promoter of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, yielding 0.02 units/ml of a secreted active peroxidase. 
2135869	19901101	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Structure and properties of the extracellular inulinase of Kluyveromyces marxianus CBS 6556.	In the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus two forms of inulinase were present, namely, an inulinase secreted into the culture fluid and an inulinase retained in the cell wall. Both forms were purified and analyzed by denaturing and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. With the use of endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase H, it was established that the enzyme retained in the cell wall and the enzyme secreted into the culture fluid have similar subunits consisting of a 64-kDa polypeptide with varying amounts of carbohydrate (26 to 37% of the molecular mass). The two forms of inulinase differed in size because of their differences in subunit aggregation. The enzyme present in the culture fluid was a dimer, and the enzyme retained in the cell wall was a tetramer. The differences in oligomerization did not affect the apparent Km values towards the substrates sucrose and raffinose. These findings support the hypothesis that the retention of glycoproteins in the yeast cell wall may be caused by a permeability barrier towards larger glycoproteins. The amino-terminal end of inulinase was determined and compared with the amino terminus of the closely related invertase. The kinetic and structural evidence indicates that in yeasts two distinct beta-fructosidases exist, namely, invertase and inulinase. 
17002602	20060928	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	Mutagenesis and mechanistic study of a glycoside hydrolase family 54 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Trichoderma koningii.	A GH (glycoside hydrolase) family 54 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Trichoderma koningii G-39 (termed Abf) was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to near homogeneity by cation-exchange chromatography. To determine the amino acid residues essential for the catalytic activity of Abf, extensive mutagenesis of 24 conserved glutamate and aspartate residues was performed. Among the mutants, D221N, E223Q and D299N were found to decrease catalytic activity significantly. The kcat values of the D221N and D299N mutants were 7000- and 1300-fold lower respectively, than that of the wild-type Abf. E223Q was nearly inactive. These results are consistent with observations obtained from the Aspergillus kawachii alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase three-dimensional structure. This structure indicates that Asp221 of T. koningii Abf is significant for substrate binding and that Glu223 as well as Asp299 function as a nucleophile and a general acid/base catalyst for the enzymatic reaction respectively. The catalytic mechanism of wild-type Abf was further investigated by NMR spectroscopy and kinetic analysis. The results showed that Abf is a retaining enzyme. It catalyses the hydrolysis of various substrates via the formation of a common intermediate that is probably an arabinosyl-enzyme intermediate. A two-step, double-displacement mechanism involving first the formation, and then the breakdown, of an arabinosyl-enzyme intermediate was proposed. Based on the kcat values of a series of aryl-alpha-L-arabinofuranosides catalytically hydrolysed by wild-type Abf, a relatively small Brønsted constant, beta(lg)=-0.18, was obtained, suggesting that the rate-limiting step of the enzymatic reaction is the dearabinosylation step. Further kinetic studies with the D299G mutant revealed that the catalytic activity of this mutant depended largely on the pK(a) values (>6) of leaving phenols, with beta(lg)=-1.3, indicating that the rate-limiting step of the reaction becomes the arabinosylation step. This kinetic outcome supports the idea that Asp299 is the general acid/base residue. The pH activity profile of D299N provided further evidence strengthening this suggestion. 
12435269	20021119	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	A non-modular type B feruloyl esterase from Neurospora crassa exhibits concentration-dependent substrate inhibition.	Feruloyl esterases, a subclass of the carboxylic acid esterases (EC 3.1.1.1), are able to hydrolyse the ester bond between the hydroxycinnamic acids and sugars present in the plant cell wall. The enzymes have been classified as type A or type B, based on their substrate specificity for aromatic moieties. We show that Neurospora crassa has the ability to produce multiple ferulic acid esterase activities depending upon the length of fermentation with either sugar beet pulp or wheat bran substrates. A gene identified on the basis of its expression on sugar beet pulp has been cloned and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. The gene encodes a single-domain ferulic acid esterase, which represents the first report of a non-modular type B enzyme (fae-1 gene; GenBank accession no. AJ293029). The purified recombinant protein has been shown to exhibit concentration-dependent substrate inhibition (K(m) 0.048 mM, K (i) 2.5 mM and V(max) 8.2 units/mg against methyl 3,4-dihydroxycinnamate). The kinetic behaviour of the non-modular enzyme is discussed in terms of the diversity in the roles of the feruloyl esterases in the mobilization of plant cell wall materials and their respective modes of action. 
10618200	20000105	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Endo-xylogalacturonan hydrolase, a novel pectinolytic enzyme.	We screened an Aspergillus tubingensis expression library constructed in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis for xylogalacturonan-hydrolyzing activity in microwell plates by using a bicinchoninic acid assay. This assay detects reducing carbohydrate groups when they are released from a carbohydrate by enzymatic activity. Two K. lactis recombinants exhibiting xylogalacturonan-hydrolyzing activity were found among the 3,400 colonies tested. The cDNA insert of these recombinants encoded a 406-amino-acid protein, designated XghA, which was encoded by a single-copy gene, xghA. A multiple-sequence alignment revealed that XghA was similar to both polygalacturonases (PGs) and rhamnogalacturonases. A detailed examination of conserved regions in the sequences of these enzymes revealed that XghA resembled PGs more. High-performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry of the products of degradation of xylogalacturonan and saponified modified hairy regions of apple pectin by XghA demonstrated that this enzyme uses an endo type of mechanism. XghA activity appeared to be specific for a xylose-substituted galacturonic acid backbone.

The nucleotide sequence of a cellulase cDNA (celA) from the rumen fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum and the primary structure of the protein which it encodes were characterized. The celA cDNA was 1.95 kb long and had an open reading frame of 1,284 bp, which encoded a polypeptide having 428 amino acid residues. A sequence alignment showed that cellulase A (CELA) exhibited substantial homology with family B cellulases (family 6 glycosyl hydrolases), particularly cellobiohydrolase II from the aerobic fungus Trichoderma reesei. In contrast to previously characterized N. patriciarum glycosyl hydrolases, CELA did not exhibit homology with any other rumen microbial cellulases described previously. Primary structure and function studies in which deletion analysis and a sequence comparison with other well-characterized cellulases were used revealed that CELA consisted of a cellulose-binding domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus. These two domains were separated by an extremely Asn-rich linker. Deletion of the cellulose-binding domain resulted in a marked decrease in the cellulose-binding ability and activity toward crystalline cellulose. When CELA was expressed in Escherichia coli, it was located predominantly in the periplasmic space, indicating that the signal sequence of CELA was functional in E.coli. Enzymatic studies showed that CELA had an optimal pH of 5.0 and an optimal temperature of 40 degrees C. The specific activity of immunoaffinity-purified CELA against Avicel was 9.7 U/mg of protein, and CELA appeared to be a relatively active cellobiohydrolase compared with the specific activities reported for other cellobiohydrolases, such as T. reesei cellobiohydrolases I and II.

EG1 is a modular glycoside hydrolase family 5 endoglucanase from Volvariella volvacea consisting of an N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1) and a catalytic domain (CD). The ratios of soluble to insoluble reducing sugar produced from filter paper after 8 and 24 h of exposure to EG1 were 6.66 and 8.56, respectively, suggesting that it is a processive endoglucanase. Three derivatives of EG1 containing a core domain only or additional CBMs were constructed in order to evaluate the contribution of the CBM to the processivity and enzymatic mode of EG1 under stationary and agitated conditions. All four enzymatic forms exhibited the same mode of action on both soluble and insoluble cellulosic substrates with cellobiose as a main end product. An additional CBM fused at either the N or C terminus reduced specific activity toward soluble and insoluble celluloses under stationary reaction conditions. Deletion of the CBM significantly decreased enzyme processivity. Insertion of an additional CBM also resulted in a dramatic decrease in processivity in enzyme-substrate reaction mixtures incubated for 0.5 h, but this effect was reversed when reactions were allowed to proceed for longer periods (24 h). Further significant differences were observed in the substrate adsorption/desorption patterns of EG1 and enzyme derivatives equipped with an additional CBM under agitated reaction conditions. An additional family 1 CBM improved EG1 processivity on insoluble cellulose under highly agitated conditions. Our data indicate a strong link between high adsorption levels and low desorption levels in the processivity of EG1 and possibly other processive endoglucanses. 
20406672	20100422	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Evidence of alternative splicing of the chi2 chitinase gene from Metarhizium anisopliae.	Metarhizium anisopliae is a filamentous fungus used in the biological control of arthropods and produces several chitinases in order to break the host cuticle chitin fibers. Chitinase function during fungal cell development and/or infection processes is also an important aspect when analyzing the life cycle of entomopathogens. The expression profile analysis of the endochitinase chi2 gene acquired by RT-PCR experiments indicated the presence of two different transcripts, suggesting the occurrence of alternative splicing in the chi2 gene. The presence of two transcripts, characterized by the removal or retention of the second 72 bp intron, was further confirmed by DNA sequencing, Northern blot and qRT-PCR. Furthermore, we detected the synthesis of two different proteins from the transcripts by two-dimensional Western blot and mass spectrometry analyses. This is the first reported occurrence of alternative splicing in M. anisopliae.

A gene of glucose oxidase (GOD) from Aspergillus niger Z-25 was cloned and sequenced. The entire open reading frame (ORF) consisted of 1,818 bp and encoded a putative peptide of 605 amino acids. The gene was fused to the pPICZalphaA plasmid and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris SMD1168. The recombinant GOD (rGOD) was secreted into the culture using MF-alpha factor signal peptide under the control of the AOX1 promoter. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that rGOD exhibited a single band at around 94 kDa. The maximal GOD activity of approximately 40 U/mL was achieved in shake flask by induction under optimal conditions after 7 days. rGOD was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitate leading to a final specific activity of 153.46 U/mg. The optimum temperature and pH of the purified enzyme were 40 degrees C and 6.0, respectively. Over 88% of maximum activity was maintained below 40 degrees C. And the recombinant enzyme displayed a favorable stability in the pH range from 4.0 to 8.0. The Lineweaver-Burk plotting revealed that rGOD exhibited a K (m) value of 16.95 mM and a K (cat) value of 484.26 s(-1).

Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to characterizing expression of laccases and peroxidases and their regulation in numerous fungal species. Much attention has been brought to these enzymes broad substrate specificity resulting in oxidation of a variety of organic compounds which brings about possibilities of their utilization in biotechnological and environmental applications. Research attempts have resulted in increased production of both laccases and peroxidases by the aid of heterologous and homologous expression. Through analysis of promoter regions, protein expression patterns and culture conditions manipulations it was possible to compare and identify common pathways of these enzymes' production and secretion. Although laccase and peroxidase proteins have been crystallized and thoroughly analyzed, there are still a lot of questions remaining about their evolutionary origin and the physiological functions. This review describes the present understanding of promoter sequences and correlation between the observed regulatory effects on laccase, manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase genes transcript levels and the presence of specific response elements.

Using 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques, the full-length cDNA sequence of the AnmanSA, a gene that encodes an acidophilic beta-mannanase of Aspergillus niger LW-1 (abbreviated to AnMan5A), was identified from the total RNA. The cDNA sequence was 1417 bp in length, harboring 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions, as well as an open reading frame (ORF) which encodes a 21-aa signal peptide, a 17-aa propeptide and a 345-aa mature peptide. Based on the topology of the phylogenetic tree of beta3-mannanases from glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5, the AnMan5A belongs to the subfamily 7 of the GH family 5. Its 3D structure was modeled by the bitemplate-based method using both MODELLER 9.9 and SALIGN programs, based on the known beta-mannanase crystal structures of Trichoderma reesei (1QNO) and Lycopersicon esculentum (1RH9) from the GH family 5. In addition, the complete DNA sequence of the Anman5A was amplified from the genomic DNA using the pUCm-T vector-mediated PCR and conventional PCR methods. The DNA sequence was 1825 bp in length, containing a 5'-flanking regulatory region, 2 introns and 3 exons when compared with the full-length cDNA.

The genomic DNA was arranged as ten exons and nine introns. 
17119968	20061123	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	A chitinase gene, chiB, involved in the autolytic process of Aspergillus nidulans.	Chitinases are thought to be involved in the morphogenesis and autolysis of filamentous fungi. We cloned a gene (chiB) encoding a class V chitinase from Aspergillus nidulans. ChiB expressed in Escherichia coli had chitin-hydrolyzing activity, indicating that chiB encoded a chitinase. Deletion of chiB affected neither germination efficiency nor hyphal growth rate, but considerably reduced the intracellular and extracellular chitinase activities. The decrease in hyphal dry weight during autolytic phase was slower in the mutant than in the wild-type strain. Western blot analysis indicated that the quantity of ChiB significantly increased when the wild-type mycelia were starved for carbon sources, a condition that induced hyphal autolysis. These results suggest that chiB plays an important role in the autolytic process in A. nidulans. 
16233531	20051020	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Molecular cloning and characterization of an exoinulinase gene from Aspergillus niger strain 12 and its expression in Pichia pastoris.	A genomic DNA segment and cDNAs encoding an extracellular exoinulinase from Aspergillus niger strain 12 were cloned and sequenced. Southern blot analysis indicated that the exoinulinase gene (inuE) was present as a single copy in the genome. An open reading frame of 1611 by was interrupted by a single intron of 60 bp, and encoded a 19-amino acid signal peptide and a 518-amino acid mature protein. The mature protein contained a single Cys residue and nine potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Three distinct transcription start points were observed at positions -41 (A), -35 (A), and -31 (A) from the start codon. The 5'-noncoding region had a putative TATA at position -75 (TATAAA). Transcription of the inuE gene was induced by inulin or sucrose and repressed by fructose or glucose. The inuE cDNA was functionally expressed under the control of the alcohol oxidase gene promoter in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The deduced amino acid sequence of the inuE gene product was 91% identical to that of an exoinulinase from Aspergillus awamori. A neighbor-joining tree showed that exo- and endoinulinases found in Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. have independently evolved the respective hydrolytic activities toward terminal and internal beta-2,1-fructofuranosidic linkages in inulin. 
16128806	20050901	FEBS_J.	D016428 D013485 	Probing the determinants of substrate specificity of a feruloyl esterase, AnFaeA, from Aspergillus niger.	Feruloyl esterases hydrolyse phenolic groups involved in the cross-linking of arabinoxylan to other polymeric structures. This is important for opening the cell wall structure making material more accessible to glycoside hydrolases. Here we describe the crystal structure of inactive S133A mutant of type-A feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus niger (AnFaeA) in complex with a feruloylated trisaccharide substrate. Only the ferulic acid moiety of the substrate is visible in the electron density map, showing interactions through its OH and OCH(3) groups with the hydroxyl groups of Tyr80. The importance of aromatic and polar residues in the activity of AnFaeA was also evaluated using site-directed mutagenesis. Four mutant proteins were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris, and their kinetic properties determined against methyl esters of ferulic, sinapic, caffeic and p-coumaric acid. The k(cat) of Y80S, Y80V, W260S and W260V was drastically reduced compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. However, the replacement of Tyr80 and Trp260 with smaller residues broadened the substrate specificity of the enzyme, allowing the hydrolysis of methyl caffeate. The role of Tyr80 and Trp260 in AnFaeA are discussed in light of the three-dimensional structure. 
12489127	20021219	Yeast	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of a second alpha-amylase gene (LKA2) from Lipomyces kononenkoae IGC4052B and its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Lipomyces kononenkoae secretes a battery of highly effective amylases (i.e. alpha-amylase, glucoamylase, isoamylase and cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase activities) and is therefore considered as one of the most efficient raw starch-degrading yeasts known. Previously, we have cloned and characterized genomic and cDNA copies of the LKA1 alpha-amylase gene from L. kononenkoae IGC4052B (CBS5608T) and expressed them in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we report on the cloning and characterization of the genomic and cDNA copies of a second alpha-amylase gene (LKA2) from the same strain of L. kononenkoae. LKA2 was cloned initially as a 1663 bp cDNA harbouring an open reading frame (ORF) of 1496 nucleotides. Sequence analysis of LKA2 revealed that this ORF encodes a protein (Lka2p) of 499 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 55,307 Da. The LKA2-encoded alpha-amylase showed significant homology to several bacterial cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferases and also to the alpha-amylases of Aspergillus nidulans, Debaryomyces occidentalis, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera and Sz. pombe. When LKA2 was expressed under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase gene promoter (PGK1(p)) in S. cerevisiae, it was found that the genomic copy contained a 55 bp intron that impaired the production of biologically active Lka2p in the heterologous host. In contrast to the genomic copy, the expression of the cDNA construct of PGK1p-LKA2 in S. cerevisiae resulted in the production of biologically active alpha-amylase. The LKA2-encoded alpha-amylase produced by S. cerevisiae exhibited a high specificity towards substrates containing alpha-1,4 glucosidic linkages. The optimum pH of Lka2p was found to be 3.5 and the optimum temperature was 60 degrees C. Besides LKA1, LKA2 is only the second L. kononenkoae gene ever cloned and expressed in S. cerevisiae. The cloning, characterization and co-expression of these two genes encoding these highly efficient alpha-amylases form an important part of an extensive research programme aimed at the development of amylolytic strains of S. cerevisiae for the efficient bioconversion of starch into commercially important commodities. 
19205687	20090212	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Directed evolution of endoglucanase III (Cel12A) from Trichoderma reesei.	The stability and specific activity of endo-beta-1,4-glucanase III from Trichoderma reesei QM9414 was enhanced, and the expression efficiency of its encoding gene, egl3, was optimized by directed evolution using error-prone PCR and activity screening in Escherichia coli RosettaBlue (DE3) pLacI as a host. Relationship between increase in yield of active enzyme in the clones and improvement in its stability was observed among the mutants obtained in the present study. The clone harboring the best mutant 2R4 (G41E/T110P/K173M/Y195F/P201S/N218I) selected in via second-round mutagenesis after optimal recombinating of first-round mutations produced 130-fold higher amount of mutant enzyme than the transformant with wild-type EG III. Mutant 2R4 produced by the clone showed broad pH stability (4.4-8.8) and thermotolerance (entirely active at 55 degrees C for 30 min) compared with those of the wild-type EG III (pH stability, 4.4-5.2; thermostability, inactive at 55 degrees C for 30 min). k (cat) of 2R4 against carboxymethyl-cellulose was about 1.4-fold higher than that of the wild type, though the K (m) became twice of that of the wild type. 
16107755	20050819	J._Gen._Appl._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of a thermostable glucoamylase from Chaetomium thermophilum.	Thermostable amylolytic enzymes are currently being investigated to improve industrial processes of starch degradation. A thermostable extracellular glucoamylase (exo-1, 4-alpha-D-glucanohydrolase, E.C.3.2.1.3) from the culture supernatant of a thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum was purified to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) homogeneity by using ammonium sulfate fraction, DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography, and Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography. SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme showed a single protein band of molecular weight 64 kDa. The glucoamylase exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 4.0 and 65 degrees C. It was thermostable at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, and retained 50% activity after 60 min at 65 degrees C. The half-life of the enzyme at 70 degrees C was 20 min. N-terminal amino acid sequencing (15 residues) was AVDSYIERETPIAWN. Different metal ions showed different effects on the glucoamylase activity. Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+ enhanced the enzyme activity, whereas Fe2+, Ag+, and Hg2+ cause obvious inhibition. These properties make it applicable to other biotechnological purposes. 
19054103	20081205	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and characterization of a gene coding for chitin deacetylase specifically expressed during fruiting body development in the basidiomycete Flammulina velutipes and its expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris.	Fv-pda, a gene coding for chitin deacetylase (CDA), was isolated from the basidiomycete Flammulina velutipes by differential display targeted for genes specifically expressed during fruiting body development. The fv-pda ORF comprises 250 amino acid residues and is interrupted by 10 introns. The fv-pda cDNA was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, and the resulting recombinant FV-PDA was used for enzymatic characterization. The recombinant FV-PDA catalyses deacetylation of N-acetyl-chitooligomers, from dimer to pentamer, glycol chitin and colloidal chitin. The fv-pda was specifically expressed through the entire stage of fruiting body development, and the transcript was abundant in stipes of mature fruiting bodies. These results suggest that CDA plays an important role in the process of fruiting of F. velutipes. 
12409103	20021101	Fungal_Genet._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Regulation by carbon and nitrogen sources of a family of cellulases in Aspergillus nidulans.	The total amount of Aspergillus nidulans secreted cellulases is affected by both the carbon and nitrogen source present in the medium, and is regulated directly and/or indirectly by the carbon metabolism regulators, CreA, CreB, and CreC, and the global nitrogen metabolism regulator, AreA. We have characterized two A. nidulans genes that encode exo-cellulases, and one gene that encodes an endo-cellulase which is additional to the previously described endo-cellulase encoding gene, eglA. The putative regulatory regions 5(') of all the genes contain potential binding sites for the global carbon and nitrogen regulatory proteins, CreA and AreA. The sequences 5(') of eglA and eglB also contain potential consensus binding sites for XlnR which is involved in induction in Aspergillus niger, but none of the 5(') sequences contains an exact copy of the AceII DNA binding consensus sequence involved in induction in Trichoderma reesei, and thus it is likely that they may be induced by different pathway specific regulatory proteins. 
14532063	20031009	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Optimized expression of a thermostable xylanase from Thermomyces lanuginosus in Pichia pastoris.	Highly efficient production of a Thermomyces lanuginosus IOC-4145 beta-1,4-xylanase was achieved in Pichia pastoris under the control of the AOX1 promoter. P. pastoris colonies expressing recombinant xylanase were selected by enzymatic activity plate assay, and their ability to secrete high levels of the enzyme was evaluated in small-scale cultures. Furthermore, an optimization of enzyme production was carried out with a 2(3) factorial design. The influence of initial cell density, methanol, and yeast nitrogen base concentration was evaluated, and initial cell density was found to be the most important parameter. A time course profile of recombinant xylanase production in 1-liter flasks with the optimized conditions was performed and 148 mg of xylanase per liter was achieved. Native and recombinant xylanases were purified by gel filtration and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry and physicochemical behavior. Three recombinant protein species of 21.9, 22.1, and 22.3 kDa were detected in the mass spectrum due to variability in the amino terminus. The optimum temperature, thermostability, and circular dichroic spectra of the recombinant and native xylanases were identical. For both enzymes, the optimum temperature was 75 degrees C, and they retained 60% of their original activity after 80 min at 70 degrees C or 40 min at 80 degrees C. The high level of fully active recombinant xylanase obtained in P. pastoris makes this expression system attractive for fermentor growth and industrial applications. 
19777823	20090926	Sheng_Wu_Gong_Cheng_Xue_Bao	D004740 D016428 D013485 	[Cloning, expression and characterization of mannanase from Armillariella tabescens EJLY2098 in Pichia pastoris].	We used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) techniques to obtain the full-length cDNA of beta-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) from Armillariella tabescens EJLY2098 (an edible fungus). Sequence analysis of the 1481 bp full-length cDNA encoding 445 amino acid residues indicated that the gene contained two structural domains, cellulose-binding domains (CBD) and glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GHF5) domains, other than the conserved beta-mannanase domain. Thus, we classified this gene as a member of glycoside hydrolase family 5. Next, we cloned a 1308 bp fragment encoding the beta-mannanase mature peptide (re-atMAN47) into the expression vector pPICZalphaA and expressed it in Pichia pastoris. The yield was 440 mg/L. Enzyme activity reached a maximum of 1.067 IU/mL after 72 h of methanol induction. The re-atMAN47 had an optimal temperature of 60 degrees C and an optimal pH of 5.5. It manifested broad thermostability from 30 degrees C-65 degrees C, and was stable between pH 4.5-7.0. This study represents the first record of a beta-mannanase from Armillariella tabescens EJLY2098 and provides a new source of carbohydrate hydrolysis enzyme with good biosafety, thermostability and wide pH stability. It is a good approach for the industrial needs of feed, food and pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
19577187	20090707	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of GH11 xylanase gene from Aspergillus fumigatus MKU1 in Pichia pastoris.	A xylanase gene, xynf11a of Aspergillus fumigatus MKU1 was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris X33. Two exons of the xynf11a gene were amplified separately and fused by overlap extension PCR. The fused product was cloned in yeast expression vector pPICZB and expressed in P. pastoris under the control of the AOX1 promoter. P. pastoris transformants expressing recombinant xylanases were selected on xylan agar plate and their ability to produce the xylanase was evaluated in flask cultures. P. pastoris X33 (pZBxynf11aFP) efficiently secreted the recombinant xylanase into the medium and produced the high level of xylanase activity (14 U/ml) after 96 h of growth. The recombinant xylanase produced by P. pastoris showed maximum activity at pH 6.0 and temperature 60 degrees C. The recombinant xylanase did not exhibit any cellulase activity and hence it could be potentially used for pretreatment of paper pulp before bleaching. 
17955189	20071024	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a family 54 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Aureobasidium pullulans.	A glycosyl hydrolase family 54 (GH54) alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase gene (abfA) of Aureobasidium pullulans was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA and a 498-amino-acid open reading frame deduced from the DNA sequence. Modeling of the highly conserved A. pullulans AbfA protein sequence on the crystal structure of Aspergillus kawachii AkabfB showed that the catalytic amino acid arrangement and overall structure were highly similar including the N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal arabinose binding domains. The abfA gene was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the heterologous enzyme was purified. The protein was monomeric, migrating at 49 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluting at 36 kDa upon gel filtration. AbfA showed maximal activity at 55 degrees C and between pH 3.5 and pH 4. The enzyme had a K (m) value for p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside of 3.7 mM and a V (max) of 34.8 micromol min(-1) mg protein(-1). Arabinose acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor with a K (i) of 38.4 mM. The enzyme released arabinose from maize fiber, oat spelt arabinoxylan, and wheat arabinoxylan, but not from larch wood arabinogalactan or alpha-1,5-debranched arabinan. AbfA displayed low activity against alpha-1,5-L-arabino-oligosaccharides. The enzyme acted synergistically with endo-beta-1,4-xylanase in the breakdown of wheat arabinoxylan. Binding of AbfA to xylan from several sources confirmed the presence of a functional carbohydrate-binding module.

A gene (egl1) encoding an endoglucanase (EGL1) from Trichoderma longibrachiatum has been cloned and sequenced. This gene, homologous to the T. reesei egl1 gene, differs from it in the length of the introns (particularly the first one) and encoded protein. A cDNA fragment obtained by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method, which takes advantage of the polymerase chain reaction, has been expressed in yeast under control of the cyc-gal inducible promoter and yeast clones able to secrete active enzyme have been obtained. 
19813101	20091009	Antonie_Van_Leeuwenhoek	D016428 D013485 	A new beta-glucosidase gene from the zygomycete fungus Rhizomucor miehei.	In this study, a beta-glucosidase coding gene (bgl) of the zygomycete fungus Rhizomucor miehei has been cloned and characterized. The gene comprises a total of 2,826 bp including the coding sequence of a 717 amino acids length putative protein and 10 introns dispersed in the whole coding region. The putative N-and C-terminal catalytic domains (aa 68 to aa 274 and aa 358-601, respectively) were identified; the two domains are connected with a 84-amino-acids linker. The catalytic region showed an extensive sequence homology with other fungal beta-glucosidases classified as family 3 glycoside hydrolases. The isolated Rhizomucor gene was expressed in the related fungus Mucor circinelloides. Transformant Mucor strains maintained the introduced plasmid in an autoreplicative manner and showed significantly higher cellobiase activity than the recipient strain. 
10802187	20000510	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and targeted disruption of two polygalacturonase genes in Penicillium olsonii.	The filamentous fungus Penicillium olsonii secretes several polygalacturonases (PGs) with molecular masses of about 47 kDa. These enzymes consist of several basic and acidic isoforms, with dominant activities at pI 4.5 and pI 7.9. Two polygalacturonase genes, pg1 and pg2, have been cloned. The corresponding enzymes, PG1 and PG2, consist of 370 and 380 amino acids, respectively, and show significant similarities to endo-polygalacturonases from other filamentous fungi. Targeted disruption of pg1 resulted in the elimination of all basic PG isoforms. In contrast, disruption of pg2 reduced, but did not eliminate the acidic PG activities. The PGs of P. olsonii must therefore be encoded by a gene family of at least three genes. Induction studies with various carbon sources revealed that the acidic and basic isoforms are differentially regulated. Pectin is the best inducer of the acidic PG isoforms. The basic isoforms, however, are best induced by monosaccharides like glucose, alpha-L-rhamnose and alpha-L-arabinose. 
20619350	20100713	Fungal_Genet._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of the GPI-anchored endo β-1,3-glucanase Eng2 of Aspergillus fumigatus.	A GPI-anchored endo β-1,3-glucanase of Aspergillus fumigatus was characterized. The enzyme encoded by ENG2 (AFUA_2g14360) belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16). The activity was characterized using a recombinant protein produced by Pichiapastoris. The recombinant enzyme preferentially acts on soluble β-1,3-glucans. Enzymatic analysis of the endoglucanase activity using Carboxymethyl-Curdlan-Remazol Brilliant Blue (CM-Curdlan-RBB) as a substrate revealed a wide temperature optimum of 24-40°C, a pH optimum of 5.0-6.5 and a K(m) of 0.8 mg ml(-1). HPAEC analysis of the products formed by Eng2 when acting on different oligo-β-1,3-glucans confirmed the predicted endoglucanase activity and also revealed a transferase activity for oligosaccharides of a low degree of polymerization. The growth phenotype of the Afeng2 mutant was identical to that of the wt strain. 
16495665	20060224	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Cloning and expression of 1,2-alpha-mannosidase gene (fmanIB) from filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae: in vivo visualization of the FmanIBp-GFP fusion protein.	1,2-alpha-Mannosidase catalyzes the specific cleavage of 1,2-alpha-mannose residues from protein-linked N-glycan. In this study, a novel DNA sequence homologous to the authentic 1,2-alpha-mannosidase was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from solid-state cultured Aspergillus oryzae. The fmanIB cDNA consisted of 1530 nucleotides and encoded a protein of 510 amino acids in which all consensus motifs of the class I alpha-mannosidase were conserved. Expression of the full length of 1,2-alpha-mannosidase cDNA by the Aspergillus host, though it has rarely been done with other filamentous-fungal mannosidase, was successful with fmanIB and caused an increase in both intracellular and extracellular mannosidase activity. The expressed protein (FmanIBp) specifically hydrolyzed 1,2-alpha-mannobiose with maximal activity at a pH of 5.5 and a temperature of 45 degrees C. With Man(9)GlcNAc(2) as the substrate, Man(5)GlcNAc(2) finally accumulated while hydrolysis of the 1,2-alpha-mannose residue of the middle branch was rate-limiting. To examine the intracellular localization of the enzyme, a chimeric protein of FmanIBp with green fluorescent protein was constructed. It showed a dotted fluorescence pattern in the mycelia of Aspergillus, indicative of the localization in intracellular vesicles. Based on these enzymatic and microscopic results, we estimated that FmanIBp is a fungal substitute for the mammalian Golgi 1,2-alpha-mannosidase isozyme IB. This and our previous report on the presence of another ER-type mannosidase in A. oryzae (Yoshida et al., 2000) support the notion that the filamentous fungus has similar steps of N-linked glycochain trimming to those in mammalian cells. 
18415096	20080417	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning of a rumen fungal xylanase gene and purification of the recombinant enzyme via artificial oil bodies.	A gene encoding a xylanase, named xynS20, was cloned from the ruminal fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum. The DNA sequence of xynS20 revealed that the gene was 1,008 bp in size and encoded amino acid sequences with a predicted molecular weight of 36 kDa. The amino acid sequence alignment showed that the highest sequence identity (28.4%) is with insect gut xylanase XYL6805. According to the sequence-based classification, a putative conserved domain of glycosyl hydrolase family 11 was detected at the N-terminus of XynS20 and a putative conserved domain of family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) was observed at the C-terminus of XynS20. An Asn-rich linker sequence was found between the N-terminal catalytic domain and the C-terminal CBM of XynS20. To examine the activity of the gene product, xynS20 gene was cloned as an oleosin-fused protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, affinity-purified by formation of artificial oil bodies, released from oleosin by intein-mediated peptide cleavage, and finally harvested by concentration of the supernatant. The specific activity of purified XynS20 toward oat spelt xylan was 1,982.8 U mg(-1). The recombinant XynS20 was stable in the mild acid pH range from 5.0 to 6.0, and the optimum pH was 6.0. The optimal reaction temperature of XynS20 was 45 degrees C; at temperatures below 30 and above 55 degrees C, enzyme activity was less than 50% of that at the optimal temperature.

A cDNA coding for the glucoamylase of Corticium rolfsii AHU 9627 was cloned using synthetic oligonucleotide probes that code for inner amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme. This clone (CG 15) is 1900 base pairs long and contains the entire coding region for a polypeptide of 579 residues. Comparison with amino acid sequences of other fungal glucoamylases showed homologies of 35%-56%, and most homology with that of Aspergillus niger. The expression plasmid pACG 115 was constructed by introduction of the coding region of CG 15 into a yeast expression vector pAAH 5, containing the promoter and terminator of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHI). Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH 22, containing the recombinant plasmid pACG 115, acquired starch-saccharifying ability. 
10092840	19990327	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Kinetic characterization of Aspergillus niger N400 endopolygalacturonases I, II and C.	Endopolygalacturonases I, II and C isolated from recombinant Aspergillus niger strains were characterized with respect to pH optimum, activity on polygalacturonic acid and mode of action and kinetics on oligogalacturonates of different chain length (n = 3-7). Apparent Vmax values using polygalacturonate as a substrate at the pH optimum, pH 4.1, were calculated as 13.8 mukat.mg-1, 36.5 mukat.mg-1 and 415 nkat.mg-1 for endopolygalacturonases I, II and C, respectively. K(m) values were < 0.15 mg.mL-1 for all three enzymes. Product progression analysis using polygalacturonate as a substrate revealed a random cleavage pattern for all three enzymes and suggested processive behavior for endopolygalacturonases I and C. This result was confirmed by analysis of the mode of action using oligogalacturonates. Processivity was observed when the degree of polymerization of the substrate exceeded 5 or 6 for endopolygalacturonase I and endopolygalacturonase C, respectively. The bond-cleavage frequencies obtained for the hydrolysis of the oligogalacturonates were used to assess subsite maps. The maps indicate that the minimum number of subsites is seven for all three enzymes. Using pectins of various degrees of esterification, it was shown that endopolygalacturonase II is the most sensitive to the presence of methyl esters. Like endopolygalacturonase II, endopolygalacturonases I, C and E, which was also included in this part of the study, preferred the non-esterified pectate. Additional differences in substrate specificity were revealed by analysis of the reaction products of hydrolysis of a mixture of pectate lyase-generated delta 4,5-unsaturated oligogalacturonates of degree of polymerization 4-8. Whereas endopolygalacturonase I showed a strong preference for generating the delta 4,5-unsaturated dimer, with endopolygalacturonase II the delta 4,5-unsaturated trimer accumulated, indicating further differences in substrate specificity. For endopolygalacturonases C and E both the delta 4,5-unsaturated dimer and trimer were observed, although in different ratios.

We previously cloned three endoglucanase genes, rce1, rce2, and rce3, from Rhizopus oryzae as the first cellulase genes from the subdivision Zygomycota. In this study, an endoglucanase gene, designated a pce1 gene, was cloned by plaque hybridization with the codon usage-optimized rce1 gene as a probe from Phycomyces nitens, a member of the subdivision Zygomycota. The pec1 gene had an open reading frame of 1,038 nucleotides encoding an endoglucanase (PCE1) of 346 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence deduced from the pce1 gene consisted of a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) at the N terminus and of a catalytic domain belonging to family 45 glycoside hydrolase at the C terminus. PCE1 was purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture supernatant of P. nitens and the molecular mass was found to be 45 kDa. The optimum pH for the CMCase activity of PCE1 was 6.0, and the optimum temperature was 50 degrees C, the lowest among the family 45 endoglucanases.

A novel chitinase was detected in extracellular culture fluids of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (ATCC 20500) grown in liquid medium containing chitin as a sole carbon source. A chitinase was purified to near homogeneity from culture broth of M. anisopliae by DEAE-Sephacel, CM-Sepharose CL-6B ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration with Superose 12HR. The molecular mass of the enzyme determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was approximately 60 kDa and the optimum pH of the enzyme was 5.0. This molecular mass is different from values of 33, 43.5, and 45 kDa for endochitinases and 110 kDa for an exochitinase (N-acetylglucosaminidase) from M. anisopliae ME-1 published previously. In addition, N-terminal sequences of 60-kDa chitinase are different from those of 43.4- and 45-kDa endochitinases. The purified enzyme showed high chitinolytic activity against colloidal, crystalline chitin of crab shells as well as against p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-N-acetylglucosamide, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-N, N'-diacetylchitobiose, and p-nitrophenyl-N, N'-N"-triacetylchitotriose, indicating that this enzyme has both endo- and exochitinase activity.

D016428 D013486 D013487 	Cloning and targeted disruption of MLG1, a gene encoding two of three extracellular mixed-linked glucanases of Cochliobolus carbonum.	Mixed-linked glucanases (MLGases), which are extracellular enzymes able to hydrolyze beta 1,3-1,4-glucans (also known as mixed-linked glucans or cereal beta-glucans), were identified in culture filtrates of the plant-pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum. Three peaks of MLGase activity, designated Mlg1a, Mlg1b, and Mlg2, were resolved by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mlg1a and Mlg1b also hydrolyze beta 1,3-glucan (laminarin), whereas Mlg2 does not degrade beta 1,3-glucan but does degrade beta 1,4-glucan to a slight extent. Mlg1a, Mlg1b, and Mlg2 have monomer molecular masses of 33.5, 31, and 29.5 kDa, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of Mlg1a and Mlg1b are identical (AAYNLI). Mlg1a is glycosylated, whereas Mlg1b is not. The gene encoding Mlg1b, MLG1, was isolated by using PCR primers based on amino acid sequences of Mlg1b. The product of MLG1 has no close similarity to any known protein but does contain a motif (EIDI) that occurs at the active site of MLGases from several prokaryotes. An internal fragment of MLG1 was used to create mlg1 mutants by transformation-mediated gene disruption. The total MLGase and beta 1,3-glucanase activities in culture filtrates of the mutants were reduced by approximately 50 and 40%, respectively. When analyzed by cation-exchange HPLC, the mutants were missing the two peaks of MLGase activity corresponding to Mlg1a and Mlg1b. Together, the data indicate that Mlg1a and Mlg1b are products of the same gene, MLG1. The growth of mlg1 mutants in culture medium supplemented with macerated maize cell walls or maize bran and the disease symptoms on maize were identical to the growth and disease symptoms of the wild type. 
1320186	19920601	Mol._Gen._Genet.	D016428 	Cloning and expression of a member of the Aspergillus niger gene family encoding alpha-galactosidase.	An enzyme with alpha-galactosidase activity and an apparent molecular weight of 82 kDa was purified from culture medium of Aspergillus niger. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein shows similarity to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of alpha-galactosidases from several other organisms. Oligonucleotides, based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence, were used as probes to clone the corresponding gene from a lambda EMBL3 gene library of A. niger. The cloned gene (aglA) was shown to be functional by demonstrating that the 82 kDa alpha-galactosidase is absent from a strain with a disruption of the aglA gene, and is over-produced in strains containing multiple copies of the aglA gene. Enzyme activity assays revealed that the 82 kDa alpha-galactosidase A represents a minor extracellular alpha-galactosidase activity in A. niger. 
11319105	20010425	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of two different alpha-L-rhamnosidases, RhaA and RhaB, from Aspergillus aculeatus.	Two proteins exhibiting alpha-L-rhamnosidase activity, RhaA and RhaB, were identified upon fractionation and purification of a culture filtrate from Aspergillus aculeatus grown on hesperidin. Both proteins were shown to be N glycosylated and had molecular masses of 92 and 85 kDa, of which approximately 24 and 15%, respectively, were contributed by carbohydrate. RhaA and RhaB, optimally active at pH 4.5 to 5, showed K(m) and V(max) values of 2.8 mM and 24 U/mg (RhaA) and 0.30 mM and 14 U/mg (RhaB) when tested for p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside. Both enzymes were able to hydrolyze alpha-1,2 and alpha-1,6 linkages to beta-D-glucosides. Using polyclonal antibodies, the corresponding cDNA of both alpha-L-rhamnosidases, rhaA and rhaB, was cloned. On the basis of the amino acid sequences derived from the cDNA clones, both proteins are highly homologous (60% identity).

A gene coding for a major extracellular chitosanase was isolated from Aspergillus oryzae IAM2660. It had a multi-domain structure composed of a signal peptide, a catalytic domain, Thr- and Pro-rich linkers, and repeated peptides (the R3 domain) from the N-terminus. The R3 domain bound to insoluble powder chitosan, but it did not promote the hydrolysis rate of the chitosanase to any extent. 
9546185	19980418	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Targeted mutants of Cochliobolus carbonum lacking the two major extracellular polygalacturonases.	The filamentous fungus Cochliobolus carbonum produces endo-alpha 1,4-polygalacturonase (endoPG), exo-alpha 1,4-polygalacturonase (exoPG), and pectin methylesterase when grown in culture on pectin. Residual activity in a pgn1 mutant (lacking endoPG) was due to exoPG activity, and the responsible protein has now been purified. After chemical deglycosylation, the molecular mass of the purified protein decreased from greater than 60 to 45 kDa. The gene that encodes exoPG, PGX1, was isolated with PCR primers based on peptide sequences from the protein. The product of PGX1, Pgx1p, has a predicted molecular mass of 48 kDa, 12 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 61% amino acid identity to an exoPG from the saprophytic fungus Aspergillus tubingensis. Strains of C. carbonum mutated in PGX1 were constructed by targeted gene disruption and by gene replacement. Growth of pgx1 mutant strains on pectin was reduced by ca. 20%, and they were still pathogenic on maize. A double pgn1/pgx1 mutant strain was constructed by crossing. The double mutant grew as well as the pgx1 single mutant on pectin and was still pathogenic despite having less than 1% of total wild-type PG activity. Double mutants retained a small amount of PG activity with the same cation-exchange retention time as Pgn1p and also pectin methylesterase and a PG activity associated with the mycelium. Continued growth of the pgn1/pgx1 mutant on pectin could be due to one or more of these residual activities. 
19661691	20090808	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Cloning and homologous expression of novel lignin peroxidase genes in the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624.	Two genes, encoding YK-LiP1 and YK-LiP2, were cloned from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624, and a homologous expression system for the gene was constructed. Two full-length cDNAs (ylpA and ylpB) were isolated by degenerate RT-PCR and RACE-PCR. The results of N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of native YK-LiP1 and YK-LiP2 showed that ylpA and ylpB coded for YK-LiP2 and YK-LiP1 respectively. The promoter of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cloned from P. sordida YK-624 (PsGPD) was used to drive the expression of ylpA. Expression vector pGPD-g-ylpA was transformed into a P. sordida YK-624 uracil auxotrophic mutant, UV-64. The YlpA protein was secreted in active form by the transformants after 4 d of growth in a medium containing an excessive nitrogen source, whereas endogenous YK-LiP1 and YK-LiP2 were not produced. The physical and catalytic properties of the purified YlpA protein were very similar to those of YK-LiP2. These results suggest that homologous expression of recombinant YK-LiP2 was successful. 
8181702	19940301	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	CEL1: a novel cellulose binding protein secreted by Agaricus bisporus during growth on crystalline cellulose.	The cel1 gene of Agaricus bisporus encodes a protein (CEL1) that has an architecture resembling the multi-domain fungal cellulases, although the sequence of its putative catalytic core is not matched by any other in the protein and nucleic acid data bases. The N-terminal half of the putative catalytic domain of CEL1 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase. The fusion protein was used to raise a CEL1-specific antibody. CEL1 was detected as an extracellular 49.8 kDa protein in A. bisporus cellulose-grown cultures, where it bound strongly to cellulose. CEL1 was neither an endoglucanase, a cellobiohydrolase able to hydrolyze fluorogenic cellobiosides, a beta-glucosidase, a xylanase, nor a cellobiose: quinone oxidoreductase. CEL1 was present in some fractions of culture fluid separated by electrophoresis which released soluble sugars from crystalline cellulose. 
21920035	20110917	BMC_Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and characterization of an exopolygalacturonase from Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense race 1 and race 4.	Fusarium wilt is an economically devastating disease that affects banana production. Although Cavendish banana cultivars are resistant to Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense race 1 (FOC1) and maitain banana production after Gros Michel was destructed by race 1, a new race race 4 (FOC4) was found to infect Cavendish. An exopolygalacturonase (PGC2) was isolated and purified from the supernatant of the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense race 4 (FOC4). PGC2 had an apparent Mr of 63 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 51.7 kDa by mass spectrometry. The enzyme was N-glycosylated. PGC2 hydrolyzed polygalacturonic acid in an exo-manner, as demonstrated by analysis of degradation products. To obtain adequate amounts of protein for functional studies between the PGC2 proteins of two races of the pathogen, pgc2 genes encoding PGC2 from race 4 (FOC4) and race 1 (FOC1), both 1395 bp in length and encoding 465 amino acids with a predicted amino-terminal signal sequence of 18 residues, were cloned into the expression vector pPICZaA and then expressed in Pichia pastoris strains of SMD1168. The recombinant PGC2 products, r-FOC1-PGC2 and r-FOC4-PGC2, were expressed and purified as active extracellular proteins. Optimal PGC2 activity was observed at 50°C and pH 5. The Km and Vmax values of purified r-FOC1-PGC2 were 0.43 mg.mL(-1) and 94.34 units mg protein(-1) min(-1), respectively. The Km and Vmax values of purified r-FOC4-PGC2 were 0.48 mg.mL(-1) and 95.24 units mg protein(-1) min(-1), respectively. Both recombinant PGC2 proteins could induce tissue maceration and necrosis in banana plants. Collectively, these results suggest that PGC2 is the first exoPG reported from the pathogen FOC, and we have shown that fully functional PGC2 can be produced in the P. pastoris expression system. 
11115392	20001215	Biotechnol._Appl._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	An Aspergillus chitosanase with potential for large-scale preparation of chitosan oligosaccharides.	A chitosan-degrading fungus, designated Aspergillus sp. Y2K, was isolated from soil. The micro-organism was used for producing chitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132) in a minimal medium containing chitosan as the sole carbon source. The induced chitosanase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrate by concentration and cationic SP-Sepharose chromatography. The purified enzyme is a monomer with an estimated molecular mass of 25 kDa by SDS/PAGE and of 22 kDa by gel-filtration chromatography. pI, optimum pH and optimum temperature values were 8.4, 6.5 and 65-70 degrees C, respectively. The chitosanase is stable in the pH range from 4 to 7.5 at 55 degrees C. Higher deacetylated chitosan is a better substrate. Chitin, xylan, 6-O-sulphated chitosan and O-carboxymethyl chitin were indigestible by the purified enzyme. By endo-splitting activity, the chitosanase hydrolysed chitosan to form chitosan oligomers with chitotriose, chitotetraose and chitopentaose as the major products. The enzyme hydrolyses chitohexaose to form chitotriose, while the chitopentaose and shorter oligomers remain intact. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined as YNLPNNLKQIYDDHK, which provides useful information for further gene cloning of this enzyme. A 275 g-scale hydrolysis of chitosan was performed. The product distribution was virtually identical to that of the small-scale reaction. Owing to the simple purification process and high stability of the enzyme, it is potentially valuable for industrial applications.

We have cloned and characterized the alpha-amylase gene (AMY1) of the yeast Schwanniomyces occidentalis. A cosmid gene library of S. occidentalis DNA was screened in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for alpha-amylase secretion. The positive clone contained a DNA fragment harbouring an open reading frame of 1536 nucleotides coding for a 512-amino-acid polypeptide with a calculated Mr of 56,500. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals significant similarity to the sequence of the Saccharomycopsis fibuligera and Aspergillus oryzae alpha-amylases. The AMY l gene was found to be expressed from its original promoter in S. cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis and Schizo-saccharomyces pombe leading to an active secreted gene product and thus enabling the different yeast transformants to grow on starch as a sole carbon source. 
12767807	20030528	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Production and characterization of the Talaromyces stipitatus feruloyl esterase FAEC in Pichia pastoris: identification of the nucleophilic serine.	Feruloyl esterases constitute an interesting group of enzymes that have the potential for use over a broad range of applications in the agri-food industries. We report the over-expression and characterization of a novel feruloyl esterase exhibiting broad substrate specificity from Talaromyces stipitatus (FAEC) in Pichia pastoris. Using various gene constructions, we have investigated the use of alternative signal peptides to produce an authentic feruloyl esterase featuring the N-terminal sequence determined for the native enzyme. We demonstrate that additional amino acids at the N-terminus of the FAEC sequence do not influence the catalytic capacity of the enzyme, and that the nature of the signal sequence has a limited effect on the yield of the secreted enzyme, with the T. stipitatus FAEC signal sequence producing 297 mgL(-1), the Neurospora crassa Fae-1 260 mgL(-1), and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor secretion signal 214 mgL(-1). Mature FAEC contains two internal peptide sequences that correspond with the consensus motif G-X-S-X-G that contains the catalytic serine nucleophile, which is conserved in the esterase enzyme superfamily. The serine residues at the center of these peptide motifs have been independently mutated and the corresponding enzymes have been over-expressed in P. pastoris to identify the candidate nucleophilic residue responsible for catalyzing the enzymatic reaction. Purified recombinant FAEC containing S465A retained the esterase activity and appeared unaffected by the amino acid modification. In contrast, FAEC activity containing S166A was below the HPLC detection limit, suggesting that serine 166 constitutes the nucleophile.

D016428 D013485 	Characterization of the endoglucanase and glucomannanase activities of a glycoside hydrolase family 45 protein from Penicillium decumbens 114-2.	The gene encoding a glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 45 endoglucanase (Cel45A) was cloned from P. decumbens 114-2 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. To our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of a GH family 45 protein from Penicillium species. The purified recombinant enzyme showed a higher activity on konjac glucomannan (KGM) than on sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) or phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC). The highest hydrolytic activity was detected at pH5.0 on KGM and pH 3.5 on CMC-Na, indicating the mode of action on the two substrates may be different for Cel45A. The optimum temperatures on the two substrates were both 60 degrees C and about 90% relative activities were retained at 70 degrees C. Products released from PASC and CMC-Na were mainly cellobiose, cellotriose and cellotetraose. The protein with higher glucomannanase activity might help the efficient degradation of lignocellulose by P. decumbens in the natural state.

Endo-M, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Mucor hiemalis, is known as a useful enzyme for the synthesis of neoglycopeptides due to its transglycosylation activity. We cloned the Endo-M gene encoding a putative 744 amino acids, which shows high identity to glycoside hydrolase family 85 endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases. The gene encoding Endo-M was expressed in protease-deficient Candida boidinii with a molecular mass of 85 kDa as a monomeric form. Recombinant Endo-M could liberate both high-mannose type and biantennary complex type oligosaccharides from glycopeptides, which was same as the native enzyme. The Km and Kcat values for DNS-Man6GlcNAc2Asn were 0.51 mM and 8.25 s(-1), respectively. Recombinant Endo-M also exhibited transglycosylation activity toward high-mannose type and biantennary complex type oligosaccharides, which were transferred to alcohols, monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and glycosides. To investigate about the catalytically essential amino acids of Endo-M, site-directed mutagenesis was performed, and it was found that mutants E177G and E177Q completely abolished the hydrolytic activity and W228R partially abolished the transglycosylation activity.

The protein PgChP is a new chitosanase produced by Penicillium chrysogenum AS51D that showed antifungal activity against toxigenic molds. Two isoforms were found by SDS-PAGE in the purified extract of PgChP. After enzymatic deglycosylation, only the smaller isoform was observed by SDS-PAGE. Identical amino acid sequences were obtained from the two isoforms. Analysis of the molecular mass by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry revealed six major peaks from 30 to 31 kDa that are related to different levels of glycosylation. The pgchp gene has 1,146 bp including four introns and an open reading frame encoding a protein of 304 amino acids. The translated open reading frame has a predicted mass of 32 kDa, with the first 21 amino acids comprising a signal peptide. Two N glycosylation consensus sequences are present in the protein sequence. The deduced sequence showed high identity with fungal chitosanases. A high level of catalytic activity on chitosan was observed. PgChP is the first chitosanase described from P. chrysogenum. Given that enzymes produced by this mold species are granted generally recognized as safe status, PgChP could be used as a food preservative against toxigenic molds and to obtain chitosan oligomers for food additives and nutraceuticals.

A cDNA from Penicillium minioluteum HI-4 encoding a dextranase (1,6-alpha-glucan hydrolase, EC 3.2.1.11) was isolated and characterized. cDNA clones corresponding to genes expressed in dextran-induced cultures were identified by differential hybridization. Southern hybridization and restriction mapping analysis of selected clones revealed four different groups of cDNAs. The dextranase cDNA was identified after expressing a cDNA fragment from each of the isolated groups of cDNA clones in the Escherichia coli T7 system. The expression of a 2 kb cDNA fragment in E. coli led to the production of a 67 kDa protein which was recognized by an anti-dextranase polyclonal antibody. The cDNA contains 2109 bp plus a poly(A) tail, coding for a protein of 608 amino acids, including 20 N-terminal amino acid residues which might correspond to a signal peptide. There was 29% sequence identity between the P. minioluteum dextranase and the dextranase from Arthrobacter sp. CB-8.

An endo-1,4-β-mannanase gene (RmMan5A) was cloned from the thermophilic fungus Rhizomucor miehei for the first time and expressed in Escherichia coli . The gene had an open reading frame of 1330 bp encoding 378 amino acids and contained four introns. It displayed the highest amino acid sequence identity (42%) with the endo-1,4-β-mannanases from glycoside hydrolase family 5. The purified enzyme was a monomer of 43 kDa. RmMan5A displayed maximum activity at 55 °C and an optimal pH of 7.0. It was thermostable up to 55 °C and alkali-tolerant, displaying excellent stability over a broad pH range of 4.0-10.0, when incubated for 30 min without substrate. The enzyme displayed the highest specificity for locust bean gum (K(m) = 3.78 mg mL⁻¹), followed by guar gum (K(m) = 7.75 mg mL⁻¹) and konjac powder (K(m) = 22.7 mg mL⁻¹). RmMan5A hydrolyzed locust bean gum and konjac powder yielding mannobiose, mannotriose, and a mixture of various mannose-linked oligosaccharides. It was confirmed to be a true endo-acting β-1,4-mannanase, which showed requirement of four mannose residues for hydrolysis, and was also capable of catalyzing transglycosylation reactions. These properties make RmMan5A highly useful in the food/feed, paper and pulp, and detergent industries. 
18083533	20071218	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, expression and characterization of a thermotolerant endoglucanase from Syncephalastrum racemosum (BCC18080) in Pichia pastoris.	Endoglucanase is a major cellulolytic enzyme produced by Syncephalastrum racemosum (BCC18080). Preliminary results showed that this endoglucanase is thermotolerant as it retained more than 50% of its activity after incubation at 80 degrees C for an hour. As this property may be of industrial use, we have cloned the full-length BCC18080 endoglucanase gene of 1020 nucleotides. Sequence analysis suggested that it belonged to the glycosyl hydrolase family 45. N-terminal sequencing and analysis by SignalP program suggested that the first 32 amino acid residues encoded the signal peptide. Expression of the recombinant clones with and without its own signal peptide in Pichia pastoris demonstrated that P. pastoris produced active 55 and 30 kDa secreted proteins. N-terminal sequencing suggested that the 55 kDa band was the mature protein while the 30 kDa band was the truncated protein. Glycoprotein analysis showed that the 55 kDa protein was glycosylated; while the smaller protein was not. All recombinant endoglucanases showed optimal temperature of 70 degrees C and optimal pH of 5-6. They retained more than 50% activity for 4h at 70 degrees C. In addition, high k(cat) and low apparent K(m) of these recombinant proteins indicated good properties of this enzyme against carboxylmethylcellulose. 
10830498	20000601	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Molecular cloning and characterization of a transcriptional activator gene, amyR, involved in the amylolytic gene expression in Aspergillus oryzae.	A gene, designated amyR, coding for a transcriptional activator involved in amylolytic gene expression has been cloned from Aspergillus oryzae by screening for a clone that enabled to reverse the reduced expression of the alpha-amylase gene (amyB) promoter. amyR encodes 604 amino acid residues of a putative DNA-binding protein carrying a zinc binuclear cluster motif (Zn(II)2Cys6) belonging to the GAL4 family of transcription factors. The amyR gene disruptants showed a significant restricted growth on starch medium and produced little of the amylolytic enzymes including alpha-amylase and glucoamylase compared with a non-disruptant, indicating that amyR is a transcriptional activator gene involved in starch/maltose-induced efficient expression of the amylolytic genes in A. oryzae. In addition, sequencing analysis found that amyR, agdA (encoding alpha-glucosidase), and amyA (encoding alpha-amylase), are clustered on a 12-kb DNA fragment of the largest chromosome in A. oryzae, and that amyR is about 1.5 kb upstream of agdA and transcribed in the opposite direction. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that the amyR gene was expressed in the presence of glucose comparable to the level in the presence of maltose, while the amylolytic genes were transcribed at high levels only in the presence of maltose.

The marine-derived Williopsis saturnus WC91-2 was found to produce very high killer toxin activity against the pathogenic yeast Metschnikowia bicuspidata WCY isolated from the diseased crab. It is interesting to observe that the purified beta-1,3-glucanase from W. saturnus WC91-2 had no killer toxin activity but could inhibit activity of the WC91-2 toxin produced by the same yeast. In contrast, the WC91-2 toxin produced had no beta-1,3-glucanase activity. We found that the mechanisms of the inhibition may be that the beta-1,3-glucanase competed for binding to beta-1,3-glucan on the sensitive yeast cell wall with the WC91-2 toxin, causing decrease in the amount of the WC91-2 toxin bound to beta-1,3-glucan on the sensitive yeast cell wall and the activity of the WC91-2 toxin against the sensitive yeast cells. In order to make W. saturnus WC91-2 produce high activity of the WC91-2 toxin against the yeast disease in crab, it is necessary to delete the gene encoding beta-1,3-glucanase.

A gene encoding a cellobiohydrolase (CBH) was isolated from Thermoascus aurantiacus IFO 9748 and designated as cbh1. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by cbh1 showed high homology with the sequence of glycoside hydrolase family 7. To confirm the sequence of the gene encoding the CBH, the cloned gene was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which no cellulase activity was found, and the gene product was purified and subjected to enzymatic characterization. The recombinant enzyme was confirmed as a CBH by analysis of the reaction product and designated as CBHI. Recombinant CBHI retained more than 80% of its initial activity after 1 h of incubation at 65 degrees C and was stable in the pH range 3.0-9.0. The optimal temperature for enzyme activity was about 65 degrees C and the optimal pH was about 6.0. The recombinant enzyme was found to be highly glycosylated and this glycosylation was shown to contribute to the thermostability of the enzyme. CBHI expression was shown to be induced at higher temperature in T. aurantiacus.

D016428 	A very stable beta-glucosidase from a Candida molischiana mutant strain: enzymatic properties, sequencing, and homology with other yeast beta-glucosidases.	We purified a beta-glucosidase from the mutant strain Candida molischiana 35M5N. Analysis of the kinetic properties of this enzyme did not show any differences between the previously purified wild-type enzyme and that of the mutant. Nevertheless, a study of the stability of the enzyme at different pH levels and temperatures showed the increase resistance of this protein. This enzyme was found to be stable at pH 5 for 145 h and retained 78% of its initial activity after the same time at pH 3.5 (optimal pH) and 30 degrees C. This difference between the wild-type and the mutant enzyme could be explained by differences in the quantity or quality of glycosylation. This glycoprotein showed different forms after deglycosylation. Some peptides from this protein were also sequenced.

The Aspergillus aculeatus MRC11624 man1 gene, encoding an endo-beta-1,4-mannanase, was cloned and expressed in the promising heterologous enzyme producer, the ascomycetous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Both single- and multi-copy transformants were constructed, and the secretion of the enzyme was evaluated as an in-frame fusion with the LIP2 secretion signal, as well as with its natural secretion signal. In shake-flask analysis, the highest volumetric enzyme activity (13,073 nkat/ml) and specific enzyme activity (1,020 nkat/(mg dcw)) were obtained with a multi-copy integrant utilizing beta-mannanase's own secretion signal. The best beta-mannanase-producing strain was subsequently evaluated in batch fermentation and resulted in a maximum volumetric enzyme activity of 6,719 nkat/ml. Fed batch fermentations resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in volumetric enzyme activity compared with batch fermentation, and a maximum titre of 26,139 nkat/ml was obtained. The results reported in this study indicate that Y. lipolytica is a promising producer of A. aculeatus beta-mannanase, producing higher beta-mannanase activity than that of recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Aspergillus niger when cultivated in shake flasks, which is encouraging for the use of the enzyme in industrial processes such as extraction of vegetable oil from leguminous seeds and the reduction in viscosity of coffee extracts. 
17922847	20071010	FEBS_J.	D016428 D013485 	Substrate recognition by glycoside hydrolase family 74 xyloglucanase from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	The basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium produces xyloglucanase Xgh74B, which has the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 74 catalytic domain and family 1 carbohydrate-binding module, in cellulose-grown culture. The recombinant enzyme, which was heterologously expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, had high hydrolytic activity toward xyloglucan from tamarind seed (TXG), whereas other beta-1,4-glucans examined were poor substrates for the enzyme. The existence of the carbohydrate-binding module significantly affects adsorption of the enzyme on crystalline cellulose, but has no effect on the hydrolysis of xyloglucan, indicating that the domain may contribute to the localization of the enzyme. HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS analyses of the hydrolytic products of TXG clearly indicated that Xgh74B hydrolyzes the glycosidic bonds of unbranched glucose residues, like other GH family 74 xyloglucanases. However, viscometric analysis suggested that Xgh74B hydrolyzes TXG in a different manner from other known GH family 74 xyloglucanases. Gel permeation chromatography showed that Xgh74B initially produced oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization (DP) 16-18, and these oligosaccharides were then slowly hydrolyzed to final products of DP 7-9. In addition, the ratio of oligosaccharides of DP 7-9 versus those of DP 16-18 was dependent upon the pH of the reaction mixture, indicating that the affinity of Xgh74B for the oligosaccharides of DP 16-18 is affected by the ionic environment at the active site. 
7906649	19940201	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Identification of a glutamate residue at the active site of xylanase A from Schizophyllum commune.	The xylanase A (endo-1,4-beta-D-xylan xylanhydrolase) of the basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune was treated with the powerful carboxylate-modifying reagent 1-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethyl-pentyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide iodide (EAC) in the presence of substrate. This treatment was followed by complete inactivation of the enzyme with [14c]EAC after the removal of excess reagent and protecting ligand. The inactivated enzyme was digested with endoproteinase Arg-C or trypsin, and peptides were separated and purified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Following sub-digestion of individual radioactive peptides with staphylococcal V8 protease and endoproteinase Lys-C, amino acid composition analysis and sequencing analysis revealed that the [14C]EAC label was bound exclusively to Glu87. Comparison of the primary sequences of related xylanase with that of xylanase A revealed that Glu87 is a highly conserved residue. Based on this similarity and the mechanism of carbodiimide action, Glu87 is proposed to act as the nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism of xylanase A. The possible environment of the putative catalytic glutamate residue was explored using hydrophobic-cluster analysis and secondary-structure prediction based on the primary sequence of xylanase. 
17111131	20061118	J._Ind._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Inulinase production by a marine yeast Pichia guilliermondii and inulin hydrolysis by the crude inulinase.	Marine yeast strain 1, isolated from the surface of a marine alga, was found to secrete a large amount of inulinase into the medium. This marine yeast was identified as a strain of Pichia guilliermondii according to the results of routine yeast identification and molecular methods. The crude inulinase produced by this marine yeast worked optimally at pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C. The optimal medium for inulinase production was seawater containing 4.0% (w/v) inulin and 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, while the optimal cultivation conditions for inulinase production were pH 8.0, 28 degrees C and 170 rpm. Under the optimal conditions, over 60 U ml(-1) of inulinase activity was produced within 48 h of fermentation in shake flasks. A large amount of monosaccharides and a trace amount of oligosaccharides were detected after the hydrolysis, indicating that the crude inulinase had a high exoinulinase activity.

The gene encoding invertase (INV) has been cloned from Schwanniomyces occidentalis. The enzyme consists of 533 amino acids, 8 potential glycosylation sites and has a 45% identity with the invertase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proenzyme has a 22 amino acid signal sequence that has a high alpha-helical transmembrane potential which differs significantly from that predicted for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme. 
19527927	20090617	Bioresour._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and enzymatic characterization of two beta-endoxylanases from Trichoderma sp. K9301 and their actions in xylooligosaccharide production.	Trichoderma sp. K9301 secreting endoxylanases with an activity of 2836 U/g (dry weight) was screened for XOs production. Two acidic beta-endoxylanases EX1 (30.1 kDa) and EX2 (20.1 kDa) were purified from crude extract of the strain K9301 in solid fermentation. Action modes of EX1 and EX2 towards XOs showed similar hydrolysis characters to endoxylanases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 10 and 11, respectively. EX1 exhibited better affinity but lower hydrolytic efficiency than EX2 to xylans from beechwood, birchwood, and oat-spelt. They had synergistic action on xylan hydrolysis. The optimum condition to prepare XOs from corncobs was obtained as 10 mg/ml corncob xylan incubated with 10 U/mg crude enzymes at 50 degrees C for 3 h. The yield of XOs reached 43.3%, and only a little amount of xylose (3.1%) was simultaneously produced, suggesting the good potential of strain K9301 in XOs production. 
2187435	19900501	Biochem._J.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of the invertase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A comparative analysis with the invertase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) was purified to homogeneity from exponentially growing cells of Schizosaccharomyces pombe fully de-repressed for synthesis of the enzyme, and was shown to be a high-molecular-mass glycoprotein that can be dissociated in the presence of 8 M-urea/1% SDS into identical subunits with an apparent molecular mass of 205 kDa. The carbohydrate moiety, accounting for 67% of the total mass, is composed of equimolar amounts of mannose and galactose. There is a small amount of glucosamine, which is probably involved in the linkage to the protein moiety, since the enzyme is sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H. The composition of the carbohydrate moiety resembles that found in higher-eukaryotic glycoproteins and differs from glycoproteins found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein portion of each subunit is a polypeptide of molecular mass 60 kDa, very similar to the invertase of Sacch. cerevisiae. Both proteins cross-react with antibodies raised against the protein fractions of the other, indicating that the two enzymes are similar. 
16614901	20060415	Biotechnol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Gene cloning and heterologous expression of glycoside hydrolase family 55 beta-1,3-glucanase from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	The basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium produces several beta-1,3-glucanases when grown on laminarin, a beta-1,3/1,6-glucan, as the sole carbon source. To characterize one of the major unknown beta-1, 3-glucanases with a molecular mass of 83 kDa, identification, cloning, and heterologous over-expression were carried out using the total genomic information of P. chrysosporium. The cDNA encoding this enzyme included an ORF of 2337 bp and the deduced amino acid sequence contains a predicted signal peptide of 26 amino acids and the mature protein of 752 amino acids. The amino acid sequence showed a significant similarity with glycoside hydrolase family 55 enzymes from filamentous fungi and was named Lam55A. Since the recombinant Lam55A expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris degraded branched beta-1,3/1,6-glucan as well as linear beta-1,3-glucan, the kinetic features of the enzyme were compared with those of other beta-1,3-glucanases. 
2510150	19890801	Protein_Eng.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Site-directed mutagenesis at the active site Trp120 of Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase.	Trp120 of Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase has previously been shown by chemical modification to be essential for activity and tentatively to be located near subsite 4 of the active site. To further test its role, restriction sites were inserted in the cloned A.awamori gene around the Trp120 coding region, and cassette mutagenesis was used to replace it with His, Leu, Phe and Tyr. All four mutants displayed 2% or less of the maximal activity (kcat) of wild-type glucoamylase towards maltose and maltoheptaose. Michaelis constants (KM) of mutants decreased 2- to 3-fold for maltose and were essentially unchanged for maltoheptaose compared with the wild type, except for a greater than 3-fold decrease for maltoheptaose with the Trp120----Tyr mutant. This mutant also bound isomaltose more strongly and had more selectivity for its hydrolysis than wild-type glucoamylase. A subsite map generated from malto-oligosaccharide substrates having 2-7 D-glucosyl residues indicated that subsites 1 and 2 had greater affinity for D-glucosyl residues in the Trp120----Tyr mutant than in wild-type glucoamylase. These results suggest that Trp120 from a distant subsite is crucial for the stabilization of the transition-state complex in subsites 1 and 2. 
11168728	20010213	J._Appl._Microbiol.	D016428 	Cloning and heterologous expression of xylanase from Pichia stipitis in Escherichia coli.	The main goal of this study was to characterize the xylanase (xynA) gene from Pichia stipitis NRRL Y-11543. The xylanase gene was cloned into pUC19 in Escherichia coli DH5alphaF' and selected by growth on RBB-xylan. All functional clones contained a recombinant plasmid with an insert of 2.4 kbp, as determined by restriction mapping. The nucleotide sequence of the P. stipitis xylanase gene consisted of 1146 bp and encoded a protein of 381 amino acids with a molecular weight of 43 649 Da. The sequence contained a putative 20-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence and four N-linked glycosylation sites. The Km values for non-glycosylated and glycosylated xylanases were 1.4 mg ml-1 and 4.2 mg ml-1, respectively, and Vmax values were 0.8 and 0.082 micromol min-1 mg-1 protein, respectively. Xylanase, a rarely found enzyme in yeast species, has been characterized in detail. The results of this study can be used to develop better xylanase-utilizing yeast strains. 
9758775	19981006	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	The transcriptional activator XlnR regulates both xylanolytic and endoglucanase gene expression in Aspergillus niger.	The expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in xylan degradation and two endoglucanases involved in cellulose degradation was studied at the mRNA level in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. A strain with a loss-of-function mutation in the xlnR gene encoding the transcriptional activator XlnR and a strain with multiple copies of this gene were investigated in order to define which genes are controlled by XlnR. The data presented in this paper show that the transcriptional activator XlnR regulates the transcription of the xlnB, xlnC, and xlnD genes encoding the main xylanolytic enzymes (endoxylanases B and C and beta-xylosidase, respectively). Also, the transcription of the genes encoding the accessory enzymes involved in xylan degradation, including alpha-glucuronidase A, acetylxylan esterase A, arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase A, and feruloyl esterase A, was found to be controlled by XlnR. In addition, XlnR also activates transcription of two endoglucanase-encoding genes, eglA and eglB, indicating that transcriptional regulation by XlnR goes beyond the genes encoding xylanolytic enzymes and includes regulation of two endoglucanase-encoding genes. 
10931904	20000810	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485 	Primary sequence and enzymic properties of two modular endoglucanases, Cel5A and Cel45A, from the anaerobic fungus Piromyces equi.	Two endoglucanase cDNAs, designated cel5A and cel45A, were isolated from a cDNA library of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces equi. Sequence analysis revealed that cel5A has an open reading frame of 5142 bp and encodes a 1714 amino acid modular enzyme, Cel5A, with a molecular mass of 194847 Da. Cel5A consists of four catalytic domains homologous to family-5 glycosyl hydrolases, two C-terminal dockerins and one N-terminal dockerin. This is the first report of a complete gene containing tandem repeats of family-5 catalytic domains. The cDNA cel45A has an open reading frame of 1233 bp and encodes a 410 amino acid modular enzyme, Cel45A, with a molecular mass of 44380 Da. The catalytic domain, located at the C terminus, is homologous to the family-45 glycosyl hydrolases. Cel45A is the first family-45 enzyme to be described in an anaerobe. The presence of dockerins at the N and C termini of Cel5A and at the N terminus of Cel45A implies that both enzymes are part of the high-molecular-mass cellulose-degrading complex produced by Piromyces equi. The catalytic domain nearest the C terminus of Cel5A and the catalytic domain of Cel45A were hyperexpressed as thioredoxin fusion proteins, Trx-Cel5A' and Trx-Cel45A', and subjected to biochemical analysis. Trx-Cel5A' has a broad substrate range, showing activity against carboxymethylcellulose, acid-swollen cellulose, barley beta-glucan, lichenin, carob galactomannan, p-nitrophenyl beta-D-cellobiopyranoside and xylan. Trx-Cel45A' is active against carboxymethylcellulose, acid-swollen cellulose and the mixed linkage glucans, barley beta-glucan and lichenin. 
8939815	19961201	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Molecular characterization of xyn3, a member of the endoxylanase multigene family of the rumen anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix frontalis.	Different cDNAs designated xyn3 and xyn4 were isolated from an expression library of the anaerobic rumen fungus Neocallimastix frontalis. Xyn3 was further characterized and was shown to contain a single open reading frame of 1821 bp coding for a protein, XYN3, of 607 amino acids (Mr 66 000). The predicted primary structure of XYN3 consisted of two large reiterated regions of 223 amino acids with a high degree of identity (88.3%). Each domain of XYN3, XYN3A and XYN3B, showed significant homology with fungal and bacterial xylanases belonging to the endoxylanase family 11. XYN3 and XYN3A were cloned in a bacterial expression plasmid harbouring a 6 His-C terminal tag and the recombinant proteins XYN3 and XYN3A were purified from Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins had Mr of 66 800 and 34 000 respectively and hydrolysed xylan to xylo-oligosaccharides. Analysis of truncated forms of XYN3 confirmed that the full-length protein contained two catalytic domains displaying similar substrate specificity. Western-blot analysis using antiserum raised against XYN3A showed that the N. frontalis xylanase was not submitted to post-translational maturation. XYN3A antiserum recognized similar polypeptides in the culture medium of two other rumen fungi, Piromyces rhizinflata and Caecomyces communis.

An endoxylanase gene (PoxynA) that belongs to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 11 was cloned from a xylanolytic strain, Penicillium oxalicum B3-11(2). PoxynA was overexpressed in Trichoderma reesei QM9414 by using a constitutive strong promoter of the encoding pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc). The high extracellular xylanase activities in the fermentation liquid of the transformants were maintained 29~35-fold higher compared with the wild strain. The recombinant POXYNA was purified to homogeneity, and its characters were analyzed. Its optimal temperature and pH value were 50 degrees C and 5.0, respectively. The enzyme was stable at a pH range of 2.0 to 7.0. Using beechwood as the substrate, POXYNA had a high specific activity of 1,856 +/- 53.5 IU/mg. In the presence of metal ions, such as Cu2+, and Mg2+, the activity of the enzyme increased. However, strong inhibition of the enzyme activity was observed in the presence of Mn2+ and Fe2+. The recombinant POXYNA hydrolyzed birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan, and oat spelt xylan to produce short-chain xylooligosaccharides, xylopentaose, xylotriose, and xylobiose as the main products. This is the first report on the expression properties of a recombinant endoxylanase gene from Penicillium oxalicum. The properties of this endoxylanase make it promising for applications in the food and feed industries. 
23597920	20130420	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a glycoside hydrolase family-51 α-l-arabinofuranosidase gene from Aureobasidium pullulans ATCC 20524 and its encoded product.	The genomic DNA and cDNA encoding α-l-arabinofuranosidase were cloned from the dimorphic fungus Aureobasidium pullulans ATCC 20524 and sequenced. The open reading frame (2097 bp) of the α-l-arabinofuranosidase gene abfB was interrupted by five introns of 49, 49, 50, 65, and 49 bp. The gene encoded a presumed signal peptide of 17 residues and a mature protein of 682 residues with a calculated Mr of 74,230 Da and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.95. Glu-362 and Glu-440 residues are likely involved in catalytic reactions as an acid/base and a nucleophile, respectively. The protein possessed 15 potential N-glycosylation sites. The deduced amino acid sequence of the abfB gene product was 58% identical to the Penicillium purpurogenum ABF 2, which belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family-51 α-l-arabinofuranosidase. The abfB cDNA was functionally expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant enzyme, AbfB, was purified from the culture filtrate, and it appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent Mr of 110 kDa. AbfB showed α-l-arabinofuranosidase activity of 56.6 U/mg of protein toward p-nitrophenyl (pNP) α-l-arabinofuranoside at optimal pH 4.5 and 75°C. The enzyme exhibited apparent Km and Vmax values of 6.27 mM and 78.1 μmol/mg/min, respectively, for pNP α-l-arabinofuranoside. The enzyme was highly active on rye arabinoxylan as well as pNP α-l-arabinofuranoside, but it showed weak activity toward α-(1→5)-l-arabinobiose, α-(1→5)-l-arabinotriose, branched l-arabinan, linear α-(1→5)-l-arabinan, and arabinogalactan.

To characterize an exo-beta-1,3-glucanase (ExgP) of an isolated fungal strain with high laminarin degradation activity, identified as Penicillium sp. KH10, heterologous secretory expression of the ExgP was performed in Aspergillus oryzae. Deduced amino acid sequence of the exgP gene possibly consisted of 989 amino acids which showed high sequence similarity to those of fungal exo-beta-1,3-glucanases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 55. Notably, the purified recombinant ExgP showed a single protein peak in the native state (by gel-permeation chromatographic analysis), but showed two protein bands in the denatured state (by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). These two polypeptides exhibited activity in a coexisting state even under reducing conditions, suggesting that non-covalent association of both polypeptides took place. Taken together with the nucleotide sequence information, the ExgP precursor (104kDa) would be proteolytically processed (cleaved) to generate two protein fragments (42 and 47kDa) and the processed products (polypeptide fragments) would be assembled each other by a non-covalent interaction. Moreover, one of the matured ExgP polypeptides was N-glycosylated by the post-translational modification.

The characterization of chitinase genes and enzymes is an important step toward global understanding of the chitinolytic system in entomopathogenic fungi. Chitinase CHIT30 from Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae (strain E6) has both endo- and exochitinase activities and is a potential determinant of pathogenicity. Serum anti-CHIT30 specifically detected this chitinase amongst five isoenzymes shown in glycol-chitin activity gels. Chitinase CHIT30 secretion is upregulated by chitin, tick cuticle and low concentrations of N-acetylglucosamine (0.25%) and is downregulated by both high N-acetylglucosamine (1%) and glucose (1%) concentrations. Chitinase CHIT30 was produced at tick cuticle during fungal infection. The chi3 gene was assigned to code chitinase CHIT30 in M. anisopliae var. anisopliae. 
9169610	19970501	Biochem._J.	D003160 D016428 	Molecular cloning and heterologous expression of the isopullulanase gene from Aspergillus niger A.T.C.C. 9642.	Isopullulanase (IPU) from Aspergillus niger A.T.C.C. (American Type Culture Collection) 9642 hydrolyses pullulan to isopanose. IPU is important for the production of isopanose and is used in the structural analysis of oligosaccharides with alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages. We have isolated the ipuA gene encoding IPU from the filamentous fungi A. niger A.T.C.C. 9642. The ipuA gene encodes an open reading frame of 1695 bp (564 amino acids). IPU contained a signal sequence of 19 amino acids, and the molecular mass of the mature form was calculated to be 59 kDa. IPU has no amino-acid-sequence similarity with the other pullulan-hydrolysing enzymes, which are pullulanase, neopullulanase and glucoamylase. However, IPU showed a high amino-acid-sequence similarity with dextranases from Penicillium minioluteum (61%) and Arthrobacter sp. (56%). When the ipuA gene was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, the expressed protein (recombinant IPU) had IPU activity and was immunologically reactive with antibodies raised against native IPU. The substrate specificity, thermostability and pH profile of recombinant IPU were identical with those of the native enzyme, but recombinant IPU (90 kDa) was larger than the native enzyme (69-71 kDa). After deglycosylation with peptide-N-glycosidase F, the deglycosylated recombinant IPU had the same molecular mass as deglycosylated native enzyme (59 kDa). This result suggests that the carbohydrate chain of recombinant IPU differed from that of the native enzyme. 
8486628	19930505	J._Biol._Chem.	D003160 D016428 	Kinetic characterization of a beta-glucosidase from a yeast, Candida wickerhamii.	The extracytoplasmic, cell-bound beta-1,4-glucosidase of Candida wickerhamii was characterized kinetically. The enzyme was found to produce glucose from cellobiose and cellodextrins (degree of polymerization from three to six) by catalyzing the removal of the terminal glucose moiety from the nonreducing end of these beta-glucans. The Km values for the series, cellobiose through cellohexaose, were 210.7, 106.6, 106.3, 105.9, and 79.8 mM, respectively, whereas the kcat values were 14.79, 13.24, 13.78, 15.13, and 7.66 mumol of glucose.min-1.mg-1 of protein, respectively. A computer program was developed to estimate the integrated rate equation. When the above kinetic constants were used in the computer model, the predicted rates of glucose formation agreed well with the experimental data. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is unable to ferment cellobiose or cellodextrins, ferments glucose about twice as fast as C. wickerhamii. If S. cerevisiae is cultured on cellobiose or cellodextrins and the purified C. wickerhamii beta-glucosidase is added to the S. cerevisiae culture at levels that mimic the production of beta-glucosidase by a C. wickerhamii culture with time, the two cultures produce ethanol at equivalent rates. This suggests that the rate-limiting step in the fermentation of cellobiose/cellodextrins by C. wickerhamii is the production of beta-glucosidase.

The cDNA comprised 2,751 bp, and included an open reading frame which encodes a polypeptide of 864 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 98,759 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed homology of fungal and mammalian alpha-glucosidases and related enzymes, and the sequence around the putative active site was well conserved among these enzymes. The cloned gene was expressed in Escherichia coli cells to produce the alpha-glucosidase, which hydrolyzes not only maltose, but also soluble starch.

The zygomycete Rhizopus oryzae sb is a very efficient organism for retting of flax, the initial microbiological step in the process of making linen. An extracellular polygalacturonase, when isolated could perform retting, and therefore probably is the key component in the retting system of R. oryzae. This was purified and characterized. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of 37,436 Da from mass spectrometric determination, an isoelectric point of 8.4, and has non-methylated polygalacturonic acid as its preferred substrate. Peptide sequences indicate that the enzyme belongs to family 28, in similarity with other polygalacturonases (EC. 3.2.1.15). It contains, however an N-terminal sequence absent in other fungal pectinases, but present in an enzyme from the phytopathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum. The biochemical background for the superior retting efficiency of R. oryzae sb is discussed.

First-strand cDNA was prepared from mRNA isolated from Aspergillus kawachii IFO4308 and the beta-xylanase gene (xynC) amplified by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. This gene was inserted between the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) gene promoter (PGK1p) and terminator (PGK1T) sequences. The PGK1p-xynC-PGK1T construct (designated XYN3) was cloned into a multicopy episomal plasmid and the XYN3 gene was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Functional beta-xylanase (Xyn3) was produced and secreted by the recombinant yeast. Xyn3 was stable between 30 and 50 degrees C, and the optimum temperature and pH were shown to be at 60 degrees C and lower than pH 3, respectively. An autoselective furl::LEU2 XYN3 recombinant strain was developed that allowed beta-xylanase production at a level of 300 nkat/ml in a non-selective complex medium. 
15469730	20041008	J._Biochem._Mol._Biol.	D016428 	Molecular cloning and determination of the nucleotide sequence of raw starch digesting alpha-amylase from Aspergillus awamori KT-11.	Complementary DNAs encoding alpha-amylases (Amyl I, Amyl III) and glucoamylase (GA I) were cloned from Aspergillus awamori KT-11 and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The sequence of Amyl III that was a raw starch digesting alpha-amylase was found to consist of a 1,902 bp open reading frame encoding 634 amino acids. The signal peptide of the enzyme was composed of 21 amino acids. On the other hand, the sequence of Amyl I, which cannot act on raw starch, consisted of a 1,500 bp ORF encoding 499 amino acids. The signal peptide of the enzyme was composed of 21 amino acids. The sequence of GA I consisted of a 1,920 bp ORF that encoded 639 amino acids. The signal peptide was composed of 24 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of Amyl III from the N-terminus to the amino acid number 499 showed 63.3% homology with Amyl I. However, the amino acid sequence from the amino acid number 501 to C-terminus, including the raw-starch-affinity site and the TS region rich in threonine and serine, showed 66.9% homology with GA I. 
15469729	20041008	J._Biochem._Mol._Biol.	D016428 	Degradation of raw starch granules by alpha-amylase purified from culture of Aspergillus awamori KT-11.	Raw-starch-digesting alpha-amylase (Amyl III) was purified to an electrophoretically pure state from the extract of a koji culture of Aspergillus awamori KT-11 using wheat bran in the medium. The purified Amyl III digested not only soluble starch but also raw corn starch. The major products from the raw starch using Amyl III were maltotriose and maltose, although a small amount of glucose was produced. Amyl III acted on all raw starch granules that it has been tested on. However, it was considered that the action mode of the Amyl III on starch granules was different from that of glucoamylase judging from the observation of granules under a scanning electron microscope before and after enzyme reaction, and also from the reaction products. Glucoamylase (GA I) was also isolated and it was purified to an electrophoretically pure state from the extract. It was found that the electron micrographic features of the granules after treatment with the enzymes were quite different. A synergistic effect of Amyl III and GA I was observed for the digestion of raw starch granules. 
9758774	19981006	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification, characterization, and substrate specificity of a novel highly glucose-tolerant beta-glucosidase from Aspergillus oryzae.	Aspergillus oryzae was found to secrete two distinct beta-glucosidases when it was grown in liquid culture on various substrates. The major form had a molecular mass of 130 kDa and was highly inhibited by glucose. The minor form, which was induced most effectively on quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone)-rich medium, represented no more than 18% of total beta-glucosidase activity but exhibited a high tolerance to glucose inhibition. This highly glucose-tolerant beta-glucosidase (designated HGT-BG) was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and anion-exchange chromatography. HGT-BG is a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa and a pI of 4.2 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. Using p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside as the substrate, we found that the enzyme was optimally active at 50 degreesC and pH 5.0 and had a specific activity of 1,066 micromol min-1 mg of protein-1 and a Km of 0.55 mM under these conditions. The enzyme is particularly resistant to inhibition by glucose (Ki, 1. 36 M) or glucono-delta-lactone (Ki, 12.5 mM), another powerful beta-glucosidase inhibitor present in wine. A comparison of the enzyme activities on various glycosidic substrates indicated that HGT-BG is a broad-specificity type of fungal beta-glucosidase. It exhibits exoglucanase activity and hydrolyzes (1-->3)- and (1-->6)-beta-glucosidic linkages most effectively. This enzyme was able to release flavor compounds, such as geraniol, nerol, and linalol, from the corresponding monoterpenyl-beta-D-glucosides in a grape must (pH 2.9, 90 g of glucose liter-1). Other flavor precursors (benzyl- and 2-phenylethyl-beta-D-glucosides) and prunin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone-7-glucoside), which contribute to the bitterness of citrus juices, are also substrates of the enzyme. Thus, this novel beta-glucosidase is of great potential interest in wine and fruit juice processing because it releases aromatic compounds from flavorless glucosidic precursors. 
9872754	19990105	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 	Sequence analysis, overexpression, and antisense inhibition of a beta-xylosidase gene, xylA, from Aspergillus oryzae KBN616.	beta-Xylosidase secreted by the shoyu koji mold, Aspergillus oryzae, is the key enzyme responsible for browning of soy sauce. To investigate the role of beta-xylosidase in the brown color formation, a major beta-xylosidase, XylA, and its encoding gene were characterized. beta-Xylosidase XylA was purified to homogeneity from culture filtrates of A. oryzae KBN616. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were found to be 4.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively, and the molecular mass was estimated to be 110 kDa based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The xylA gene comprises 2,397 bp with no introns and encodes a protein consisting of 798 amino acids (86,475 Da) with 14 potential N-glycosylation sites. The deduced amino acid sequence shows high similarity to Aspergillus nidulans XlnD (70%), Aspergillus niger XlnD (64%), and Trichoderma reesei BxII (63%). The xylA gene was overexpressed under control of the strong and constitutive A. oryzae TEF1 promoter. One of the A. oryzae transformants produced approximately 13 times more of the enzyme than did the host strain. The partial-length antisense xylA gene expressed under control of the A. oryzae TEF1 promoter decreased the beta-xylosidase level in A. oryzae to about 20% of that of the host strain. 
12224649	20020913	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of the exo-beta-D-1,3-glucanase gene (exgS) from Aspergillus saitoi.	A gene of exo-1,3-beta-D-glucanase (exgS) was cloned from a koji mold, Aspergillus saitoi, genomic DNA using PCR. The exgS has an ORF comprising 2832 bp, which contains one intron of 45 bp, and encodes 945 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequences showed that the ExgS has a non-homologous linker region consisting of 180 amino acids, which encompassed highly conserved regions observed in Exg homologues from filamentous fungi. A recombinant protein (ExgS) has been recovered from the cultural filtrate of an Aspergillus oryzae strain that carried an expression vector containing full length of the exgS. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the recombinant exo-1,3-beta-D-glucanase (ExgS) were identical to that of native ExgS from A. saitoi. 
12619666	20030307	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Production and characterization of recombinant Phanerochaete chrysosporium beta-glucosidase in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.	The extracellular beta-glucosidase from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was expressed heterologously in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. After 7 days' cultivation in an induction medium containing 1% (v/v) methanol, the expression level of the recombinant enzyme was 28,500 U/l, 38 times that of the wild-type enzyme. The specific activity of the crude recombinant enzyme for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside was 52 U/mg, 37 times that of the wild-type enzyme; this difference made the purification of the enzyme simple. On a SDS-PAGE, the molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was 133 kDa, and that of the wild-type enzyme was 116 kDa, but the difference had no effect on the hydrolysis of cellobiose or p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside. We concluded that the recombinant enzyme produced by Pichia pastoris retains the catalytic properties of the wild-type enzyme from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. 
7493964	19951208	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	The conserved noncatalytic 40-residue sequence in cellulases and hemicellulases from anaerobic fungi functions as a protein docking domain.	Two cDNAs, designated xynA and manA, encoding xylanase A (XYLA) and mannanase A (MANA), respectively, were isolated from a cDNA library derived from mRNA extracted from the anaerobic fungus, Piromyces. XYLA and MANA displayed properties typical of endo-beta 1,4-xylanases and mannanases, respectively. Neither enzyme hydrolyzed cellulosic substrates. The nucleotide sequences of xynA and manA revealed open reading frames of 1875 and 1818 base pairs, respectively, coding for proteins of M(r) 68,049 (XYLA) and 68,055 (MANA). The deduced primary structure of MANA revealed a 458-amino acid sequence that exhibited identity with Bacillus and Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa mannanases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase Family 26. A 40-residue reiterated sequence, which was homologous to duplicated noncatalytic domains previously observed in Neocallimastix patriciarum xylanase A and endoglucanase B, was located at the C terminus of MANA. XYLA contained two regions that exhibited sequence identity with the catalytic domains of glycosyl hydrolase Family 11 xylanases and were separated by a duplicated 40-residue sequence that exhibited strong homology to the C terminus of MANA. Analysis of truncated derivatives of MANA confirmed that the N-terminal 458-residue sequence constituted the catalytic domain, while the C-terminal domain was not essential for the retention of catalytic activity. Similar deletion analysis of XYLA showed that the C-terminal catalytic domain homologue exhibited catalytic activity, but the corresponding putative N-terminal catalytic domain did not function as a xylanase. Fusion of the reiterated noncatalytic 40-residue sequence conserved in XYLA and MANA to glutathione S-transferase, generated a hybrid protein that did not associate with cellulose, but bound to 97- and 116-kDa polypeptides that are components of the multienzyme cellulase-hemicellulase complexes of Piromyces and Neocallimastix patriciarum, respectively. The role of this domain in the assembly of the enzyme complex is discussed. 
1934135	19910901	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Identification and characterization of a second polygalacturonase gene of Aspergillus niger.	The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger produces several endopolygalacturonases that are involved in the degradation of pectin. PGI, the enzyme representing the second most abundant activity in a commercial enzyme preparation, was further characterized and the corresponding gene was isolated. The nucleotide sequence of the pgaI gene was determined and the protein coding region was found to be interrupted by two short introns, one of which has a unusual donor splice site. The deduced 368 amino acids long protein with a putative prepropeptide of 31 amino acids shows 60% sequence identity to PGII in the mature protein. PGI overproducing A. niger strains were obtained by cotransformation with the cloned gene. 
9805373	19981107	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of two endoinulinase genes from Aspergillus niger.	Two genomic DNAs encoding endoinulinase from Aspergillus niger 12 were cloned and sequenced. Open reading frames (ORFs) of the endoinulinase genes, inuA and inuB, both consisted of 1,548 nucleotides encoding 516 amino acids. It was suggested that the coding regions were not interrupted by introns. The ORFs differed from each other by 23 nucleotide substitutions or by eight amino acid replacements, indicating that the inuA and inuB genes arose by gene duplication. Each mature enzyme of 493 amino acids was preceded by a hydrophobic signal peptide of 23 amino acids. The enzymes contained two Cys residues and five potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. Partial amino acid sequences of the secreted enzyme suggested that it originated from the inuB gene product. The deduced amino acid sequences of the mature A. niger enzymes showed 73% identity with that of the Penicillium purpurogenum endoinulinase. 
9370370	19971125	Eur._J._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 	cDNA cloning of a Trichoderma reesei cellulase and demonstration of endoglucanase activity by expression in yeast.	A Trichoderma reesei cDNA encoding a previously unknown protein with a C-terminal cellulose-binding domain was obtained by complementation screening of a T. reesei cDNA library in a sec1 yeast mutant impaired in protein secretion. The T. reesei protein shows amino acid similarity over its entire length to the Agaricus bisporus cellulose-induced protein CEL1 whose function is not known. These two proteins form a new glycosyl hydrolase family, number 61. Expression of the T. reesei cDNA in yeast showed that it encoded a protein with endoglucanase activity and thus the protein was named EGIV and the corresponding gene egl4. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared against EGIV produced in Escherichia coli and detected a 56-kDa protein in the T. reesei culture supernatant. Northern hybridisation revealed that T. reesei egl4 is regulated in the same manner as other cellulase genes of this fungus. 
6409895	19830301	J._Biochem.	D016428 	Transglycosylation activities of exo- and endo-type cellulases from Irpex lacteus (Polyporus tulipiferae).	Two highly purified cellulases, Ex-1 [exo-type, exo-cellobiohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.91] and En-1 [endo-type, EC 3.2.1.4] obtained from Driselase, a commercial enzyme preparation from Irpex lacteus (Polyporus tulipiferae), were used in this work. Both cellulases produced 14C-cellooligosaccharides such as 14C-G2 and 14C-G3 by transglycosylation when G3, G5, or beta-PNPC was used as a donor and 14C-G1 as an acceptor. However, the transglycosylation activity of Ex-1 was far higher than that of En-1. When Ex-1 or En-1 was incubated with beta-PNPG only, no p-nitrophenol was released, but it was readily released when G3 was added to the reaction mixture. In this reaction, the optimal donor (G3) concentration for Ex-1 was 1.0 mM, and the optimal pH values of Ex-1 were at 2.7 and 3.7 for beta-PNPG and beta-PG as acceptors, respectively, these values being far lower than the ordinary optimal pH values of the cellulase (4.0-5.0).

Chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) is an important enzyme for the remodeling of chitin in the cell wall of fungi. We have cloned three chitinase genes (CHT1, CHT2, and CHT3) from the dimorphic human pathogen Candida albicans. CHT2 and CHT3 have been sequenced in full and their primary structures have been analyzed: CHT2 encodes a protein of 583 aa with a predicted size of 60.8 kDa; CHT3 encodes a protein of 567 aa with a predicted size of 60 kDa. All three genes show striking similarity to other chitinase genes in the literature, especially in the proposed catalytic domain. Transcription of CHT2 and CHT3 was greater when C. albicans was grown in a yeast phase as compared to a mycelial phase. A transcript of CHT1 could not be detected in either growth condition. 
7592488	19951201	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013485 	A novel endo-beta-1,3-glucanase, BGN13.1, involved in the mycoparasitism of Trichoderma harzianum.	The mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma harzianum CECT 2413 produces at least three extracellular beta-1,3-glucanases. The most basic of these extracellular enzymes, named BGN13.1, was expressed when either fungal cell wall polymers or autoclaved mycelia from different fungi were used as the carbon source. BGN13.1 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and was biochemically characterized. The enzyme was specific for beta-1,3 linkages and has an endolytic mode of action. A synthetic oligonucleotide primer based on the sequence of an internal peptide was designed to clone the cDNA corresponding to BGN13.1. The deduced amino acid sequence predicted a molecular mass of 78 kDa for the mature protein. Analysis of the amino acid sequence indicates that the enzyme contains three regions, one N-terminal leader sequence; another, nondefined sequence; and one cysteine-rich C-terminal sequence. Sequence comparison shows that this beta-1,3-glucanase, first described for filamentous fungi, belongs to a family different from that of its previously described bacterial, yeast, and plant counterparts. Enzymatic-activity, protein, and mRNA data indicated that bgn13.1 is repressed by glucose and induced by either fungal cell wall polymers or autoclaved yeast cells and mycelia. Finally, experimental evidence showed that the enzyme hydrolyzes yeast and fungal cell walls. 
11358516	20010519	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of Aspergillus niger genes encoding an alpha-galactosidase and a beta-mannosidase involved in galactomannan degradation.	Alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) and beta-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25) participate in the hydrolysis of complex plant saccharides such as galacto(gluco)mannans. Here we report on the cloning and characterization of genes encoding an alpha-galactosidase (AglC) and a beta-mannosidase (MndA) from Aspergillus niger. The aglC and mndA genes code for 747 and 931 amino acids, respectively, including the eukaryotic signal sequences. The predicted isoelectric points of AglC and MndA are 4.56 and 5.17, and the calculated molecular masses are 79.674 and 102.335 kDa, respectively. Both AglC and MndA contain several putative N-glycosylation sites. AglC was assigned to family 36 of the glycosyl hydrolases and MndA was assigned to family 2. The expression patterns of aglC and mndA and two other genes encoding A. niger alpha-galactosidases (aglA and aglB) during cultivation on galactomannan were studied by Northern analysis. A comparison of gene expression on monosaccharides in the A. niger wild-type and a CreA mutant strain showed that the carbon catabolite repressor protein CreA has a strong influence on aglA, but not on aglB, aglC or mndA. AglC and MndA were purified from constructed overexpression strains of A. niger, and the combined action of these enzymes degraded a galactomanno-oligosaccharide into galactose and mannose. The possible roles of AglC and MndA in galactomannan hydrolysis is discussed. 
11368016	20010523	Arch._Biochem._Biophys.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Heterologous expression of athermostable manganese peroxidase from Dichomitus squalens in Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	Dichomitus squalens belongs to a group of white-rot fungi which express manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase but do not express lignin peroxidase (LiP). To facilitate structure/function studies of MnP from D. squalens, we heterologously expressed the enzyme in the well-studied basidiomycete, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (gpd) promoter of P. chrysosporium was fused to the coding region of the mnp2 gene of D. squalens, 5 bp upstream of the translation start site, and placed in a vector containing the ural gene as a selectable marker. Purified recombinant protein (rDsMnP) was similar in kinetic and spectral characteristics to both the wild-type MnPs from D. squalens and P. chrysosporium (PcMnP). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the rDsMnP was determined and was identical to the predicted sequence. Cleavage of the propeptide followed a conserved amino acid motif (A-A-P-S/T) in both rDsMnP and PcMnP. However, the protein from D. squalens was considerably more thermostable than its P. chrysosporium homolog with half-lives 15- to 40-fold longer at 55 degrees C. As previously demonstrated for PcMnP, addition of exogenous MnII and CdII conferred additional thermal stability to rDsMnP. However, unlike PcMnP, ZnII also confers some additional thermal stability to rDsMnP at 55 degrees C. Some differences in the metal-specific effects on thermal stability of rDsMnP at 65 degrees C were noted.

A cDNA for Aspergillus oryzae glucoamylase was cloned, using oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes derived from amino sequences of peptide fragments of the enzyme. The glucoamylase cDNA, when introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, directed the secretion of active glucoamylase into the culture medium. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding 612 amino acid residues. Comparative studies with other fungal glucoamylases showed homologies of 67% with A. niger and 30% with Rhizopus oryzae of the deduced amino acid sequences. In the five conserved regions reported in other fungal glucoamylases, the levels of homologies between those regions of A. oryzae and A. niger enzymes were much higher (78-94%). A. oryzae glucoamylase contained no peptide region abundant in threonine and serine residue (TS-region), like that proposed to adsorb onto raw starch in A. awamori var. kawachii glucoamylase.

A well-known industrial fungus for enzyme production, Aspergillus niger, was selected to produce the feruloyl esterase FAEA by homologous overexpression for pulp bleaching application. The gpd gene promoter was used to drive FAEA expression. Changing the nature and concentration of the carbon source nature (maltose to glucose; from 2.5 to 60 g l(-1)), improved FAEA activity 24.5-fold and a yield of 1 g l(-1) of the corresponding protein in the culture medium was achieved. The secreted FAEA was purified 3.5-fold to homogeneity in a two-step purification procedure with a recovery of 69%. The overproduced protein was characterised and presented properties in good agreement with those of native FAEA. The recombinant FAEA was tested for wheat straw pulp bleaching, with or without a laccase mediator system and xylanase. Best results were obtained using a bi-sequential process with a sequence including xylanase, FAEA and laccase, and yielded very efficient delignification--close to 75%--and a kappa number of 3.9. This is the first report on the potential application of recombinant FAEA in the pulp and paper sector. 
8810077	19960901	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D016428 D013485 	Mutagenesis of endopolygalacturonase from Fusarium moniliforme: histidine residue 234 is critical for enzymatic and macerating activities and not for binding to polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP).	The sequence encoding the endopolygalacturonase (PG) of Fusarium moniliforme was cloned into the E. coli/yeast shuttle vector Yepsec1 for secretion in yeast. The recombinant plasmid (pCC6) was used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain S150-2B; transformed yeast cells were able to secrete PG activity into the culture medium. The enzyme (wtY-PG) was purified, characterized, and shown to possess biochemical properties similar to those of the PG purified from F. moniliforme. The wtY-PG was able to macerate potato medullary tissue disks and was inhibited by the polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) purified from Phaseolus vulgaris. The sequence encoding PG in pCC6 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Three residues in a region highly conserved in all the sequences known to encode PGs were separately mutated: His 234 was mutated into Lys (H 234-->K), and Ser 237 and Ser 240 into Gly (S 237-->G and S 240-->G). Each of the mutated sequences was used to transform S. cerevisiae and the mutated enzymes were purified and characterized. Replacement of His 234 with Lys abolished the enzymatic activity, confirming the biochemical evidence that a His residue is critical for enzyme activity. Replacement of either Ser 237 or Ser 240 with Gly reduced the enzymatic activity to 48% and 6%, respectively, of the wtY-PG. When applied to potato medullary tissue, F. moniliforme PG and wtY-PG caused comparable maceration, while the variant PGs exhibited a limited (S 234-->G and S 240-->G) or null (H 234-->K) macerating activity. The interaction between the variant enzymes and the P. vulgaris PGIP was investigated using a biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance (BIAlite). The three variant enzymes were still able to interact and bind to PGIP with association constants comparable to that of the wild type enzyme.

A gene encoding 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.113) was cloned from Penicillium citrinum genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The coding region of the gene, msdC, occupied 1737 bp and was separated into four exons by three introns. The predicted protein consisted of 511 amino acid residues with M(r) 56,569. Penicillium enzyme had a hydrophobic signal peptide at the N-terminal region as did mammalian membrane-bound alpha-mannosidases, but in this case a proteolytic cleavage occurred at Lys-35-Ser-36 to remove the signal sequence during cell growth. Parts of amino acid sequences were similar to those of mammalian Golgi alpha-mannosidase IA and IB, but the sequence around the aspartic acid residue which interacted with 1-deoxymannojirimycin (Yoshida et al. (1994) Biochem. J. 303, 97-103) was unique in Penicillium enzyme. 
9371889	19980207	Curr._Genet.	D003160 D016428 	Isolation of the glucose oxidase gene from Talaromyces flavus and characterisation of its role in the biocontrol of Verticillium dahliae.	The glucose oxidase gene from the biocontrol fungus Talaromyces flavus has been isolated and shown to be only 64% identical at the amino-acid sequence level to the similar enzyme from Aspergillus niger. A transformation system has been developed for both T. flavus and the related T. macrosporus and has been used to create Talaromyces spp. which either over-express or are deficient in glucose oxidase. In vitro inhibition experiments on Verticillium dahliae using culture filtrates from these transformants indicates that secreted glucose oxidase is responsible for a large part of the growth inhibition of V. dahliae microsclerotia and hyphae by T. flavus, although other inhibitory compounds may also play a role. In pot trials with cotton plants, both Talaromyces species had some biocontrol activity, but there was no significant difference in the incidence of Verticillium wilt with either the presence or absence of glucose oxidase activity in the biocontrol fungus. Under the experimental conditions used, insufficient glucose is presumably present in the soil around cotton roots to generate sufficient hydrogen peroxide to inhibit V. dahliae and the observed biocontrol activity must be attributed to other factors. 
8593683	19951101	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a novel alpha-amylase from Lipomyces kononenkoae and expression of its gene (LKA1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	A highly active alpha-amylase (76,250 Da) secreted by the raw starch-degrading yeast Lipomyces kononenkoae strain IGC4052B was purified and characterized. Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), end-product analysis indicated that the L. kononenkoae alpha-amylase acted by endo-hydrolysis on glucose polymers containing alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 bonds, producing mainly maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose. The following NH2-terminal amino acids were determined for the purified enzyme: Asp-Cys-Thr-Thr-Val-Thr-Val-Leu-Ser-Ser-Pro- Glu-Ser-Val-Thr-Gly. The L. kononenkoae alpha-amylase-encoding gene (LKA1), previously cloned as a cDNA fragment, was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the PGK1 promoter. The native signal sequence efficiently directed the secretion of the glycosylated protein in S. cerevisiae. De-glycosylation of the enzyme indicated that post-translational glycosylation is different in S. cerevisiae from that in L. kononenkoae. Zymogram analysis indicated that glycosylation of the protein in S. cerevisiae had a negative effect on enzyme activity. Southern-blot analysis revealed that there is only a single LKA1 gene present in the genome of L. kononenkoae. 
1878999	19910601	Curr._Genet.	D003160 D016428 	Expression and sequence comparison of the Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubigensis genes encoding polygalacturonase II.	The structure and expression of the polygalacturonase-encoding pgaII genes of two recently recognized species, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubigensis, was investigated. While the structure of the pgaII genes is very similar, showing 83% DNA sequence identity and 94% identity at the amino acid level, they have diverged significantly. The NH2-terminal sequence suggests that these PGs are made as pre pro-proteins and the secretory propeptide of the PGII precursors shows sequence homology with some other fungal pro-peptides. The expression of the pgaII genes is strongly regulated by the carbon source and the A. tubigensis gene is expressed and regulated in A. niger transformants. The low similarity of the fungal PGs with those of bacterial and plant origin is discussed in relation to the possible functional role of specific amino acids. 
1735126	19920101	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of a chitinase gene from the hyperparasitic fungus Aphanocladium album.	Recombinant clones from a cDNA library of an Aphanocladium album chitinase-overproducing mutant strain were isolated by screening with antiserum against a 39 kDa chitinase purified from this hyperparasitic fungus. Analysis of the isolated positive clones indicated that most of them carried the same cDNA. A cDNA from this group was used as a hybridization probe to isolate an 8 kb DNA fragment from a genomic library of the wild-type strain. The chitinase 1 gene was mapped to this fragment by two independent approaches. Its partial DNA sequence was in perfect agreement with an amino-terminal peptide sequence obtained by sequencing 23 amino acids of the 39 kDa chitinase. Its transfer in Fusarium oxysporum resulted in a transformant producing both a protein of about 39 kDa that cross-reacted with the chitinase antiserum and a chitinase activity that was inhibited by the same antiserum. Northern blot analysis indicates that the cloned chitinase gene was subject to catabolite repression and appeared inducible by chitin. 
14685768	20031220	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Regulation of two homodimer hexosaminidases in the mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma asperellum by glucosamine.	Trichoderma asperellum is a mycoparasitic fungus which is used as a biocontrol agent against plant pathogens. Its hydrolytic enzymes take part in its parasitic interaction, degrading the pathogen cell wall and thereby helping to control disease. One of those enzymes, beta- N-acetyl- d-glucosaminidase (GlcNAcase), degrades chitin, which is a major component of the cell wall of many plant-pathogenic fungi. Two GlcNAcases of T. asperellum T203, designated EXC1Y and EXC2Y, were purified, their genes and their promoters were sequenced, and their regulation was studied. The enzymes share homology (59% identity) but are easily distinguished by PAGE assay. Biochemical characterization, Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry demonstrated that EXC1Y and EXC2Y are both active as homodimers. Both genes are up-regulated by glucosamine (GlcN), in contrast to two endochitinases of this fungus. GlcN induces the secretion of several proteins (including a beta-glucosidase), among which EXC1Y is the most abundant. An exc2y knockout was constructed, to study the regulation of EXC1Y expression and secretion. The fungus has the ability to store a high amount of this enzyme in an active form and secrete it into the medium later. 
8433972	19930101	Protein_Eng.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Functional roles and subsite locations of Leu177, Trp178 and Asn182 of Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase determined by site-directed mutagenesis.	Fungal glucoamylases contain four conserved regions. One region from the Aspergillus niger enzyme contains three key carboxylic acid residues, the general acid catalytic group, Glu179, along with Asp176 and Glu180. Three site-directed mutations, Leu177-->His, Trp178-->Arg and Asn182-->Ala, were constructed near these acidic groups to reveal the function of other conserved residues in this region. Leu177 and Trp178 are strictly conserved among fungal glucoamylases, while an amide, predominantly Asn, always occurs at position 182. Substitutions of Leu177 or Trp178 cause significant decreases in kcat with the substrates tested. Similar increases in activation energies obtained with Leu177-->His with both alpha-(1,4)- and alpha-(1,6)-linked substrates indicate Leu177 is located in subsite 1. KM values obtained with the Trp178-->Arg mutation increase for an alpha-(1,6)-linked substrate, but not for alpha-(1,4)-linked substrates. Calculated differences in activation energy between substrates indicate Trp178 interacts specifically with subsite 2. The Asn182-->Ala mutation did not change kcat or KM values, indicating that Asn182 is not crucial for activity. These results support a mechanism for glucoamylase catalytic activity consisting of a fast substrate binding step followed by a conformational change at subsite 1 to stabilize the transition state complex. 
14988022	20040228	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 	Molecular characterization of a Penicillium chrysogenum exo-1,5-alpha-L-arabinanase that is structurally distinct from other arabinan-degrading enzymes.	The nucleotide sequence of the abnx cDNA gene, which encodes an exo-arabinanase (Abnx) of Penicillium chrysogenum 31B, was determined. Abnx was found to be structurally distinct from known arabinan-degrading enzymes based on its amino acid sequence and a hydrophobic cluster analysis. The protein in the protein database with the highest similarity to Abnx was the Neurospora crassa conserved hypothetical protein. The abnx cDNA gene product expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the release of arabinobiose from alpha-1,5-L-arabinan. The activity of the recombinant Abnx towards a series of arabino-oligosaccharides, as expressed by k(cat)/K(m) value, was greatest with arabinohexaose. 
23326459	20130118	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 	The 1.6 Å crystal structure of pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus meleagris rationalizes substrate specificity and reveals a flavin intermediate.	Pyranose dehydrogenases (PDHs) are extracellular flavin-dependent oxidoreductases secreted by litter-decomposing fungi with a role in natural recycling of plant matter. All major monosaccharides in lignocellulose are oxidized by PDH at comparable yields and efficiencies. Oxidation takes place as single-oxidation or sequential double-oxidation reactions of the carbohydrates, resulting in sugar derivatives oxidized primarily at C2, C3 or C2/3 with the concomitant reduction of the flavin. A suitable electron acceptor then reoxidizes the reduced flavin. Whereas oxygen is a poor electron acceptor for PDH, several alternative acceptors, e.g., quinone compounds, naturally present during lignocellulose degradation, can be used. We have determined the 1.6-Å crystal structure of PDH from Agaricus meleagris. Interestingly, the flavin ring in PDH is modified by a covalent mono- or di-atomic species at the C(4a) position. Under normal conditions, PDH is not oxidized by oxygen; however, the related enzyme pyranose 2-oxidase (P2O) activates oxygen by a mechanism that proceeds via a covalent flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide intermediate. Although the flavin C(4a) adduct is common in monooxygenases, it is unusual for flavoprotein oxidases, and it has been proposed that formation of the intermediate would be unfavorable in these oxidases. Thus, the flavin adduct in PDH not only shows that the adduct can be favorably accommodated in the active site, but also provides important details regarding the structural, spatial and physicochemical requirements for formation of this flavin intermediate in related oxidases. Extensive in silico modeling of carbohydrates in the PDH active site allowed us to rationalize the previously reported patterns of substrate specificity and regioselectivity. To evaluate the regioselectivity of D-glucose oxidation, reduction experiments were performed using fluorinated glucose. PDH was rapidly reduced by 3-fluorinated glucose, which has the C2 position accessible for oxidation, whereas 2-fluorinated glucose performed poorly (C3 accessible), indicating that the glucose C2 position is the primary site of attack. 
3561490	19870402	Nature	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487 	Cloning and sequencing of a cDNA for a ligninase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	Lignin is a complex polymer of phenylpropanoid subunits. It is an essential component of woody tissue, to which it imparts structural rigidity. Lignin is remarkably resistant to degradation by most microbes; nevertheless, a few species of white-rot fungi are able to catalyse its oxidation to CO2. Its biodegradation is of great ecological significance because, next to cellulose, lignin is the most abundant renewable polymer on Earth. The first step in lignin degradation is depolymerization, catalysed by the lignin peroxidase isozymes (ligninases). These isozymes are secreted, along with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds, under conditions of nutrient (nitrogen) limitation. Ligninases are not only important in lignin biodegradation, but are also potentially valuable in chemical waste disposal because of their ability to degrade environmental pollutants. We have undertaken the cloning of the ligninase genes to understand further their regulation and enzymology. We report here the isolation and characterization of a ligninase complementary DNA clone with a full-length insert. The cDNA sequence shows that the sequence of the mature ligninase is preceded by a 28-residue leader, and the mature protein is predicted to have a relative molecular mass of 37,000 (Mr 37K). Consistent with the classification of ligninase as a peroxidase certain residues thought to be essential for peroxidase activity can be identified and near these residues the ligninase shows homology with other known peroxidases. Our cDNA clone has also allowed us to show that expression of ligninase is regulated at the messenger RNA level. 
32175	19781101	J._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and properties of an exo-cellulase of Avicelase type from a wood-rotting fungus, Irpex lacteus (Polyporus tulipiferae).	A cellulase component of Avicelase type was obtained from Driselase, a commercial enzyme preparation from a wood-rotting fungus Irpex lacteus (Polyporus tulipiferae). It showed a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The amino acid composition of this cellulase resembled those of cellulase components of endo-type from the same fungus. However, it produced exclusively cellobiose from CMC as well as from water-insoluble celluloses such as Avicel or cotton at earlier stages of hydrolysis. In addition, the hydrolysis of CMC practically stopped after an initial rapid stage. The cellulase showed a strong synergistic action with an endo-cellulase of higher randomness (typical CMCase-type) in the hydrolysis of CMC as well as Avicel. In contrast to cellotriose and -tetraose, cellopentaose and -hexaose were attacked very rapidly, and only cellobiose was produced. These results suggest that the cellulase is an exo-type component. However, it mutarotated the products from cellopentaitol in the same direction as endo-cellulases. it represented a relatively large portion of the total cellulase activity, and may play an important role in the degradation of native cellulose in vivo. 
9506837	19980320	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Acetyl xylan esterase II from Penicillium purpurogenum is similar to an esterase from Trichoderma reesei but lacks a cellulose binding domain.	Penicillium purpurogenum produces at least two acetyl xylan esterases (AXE I and II). The AXE II cDNA, genomic DNA and mature protein sequences were determined and show that the axe 2 gene contains two introns, that the primary translation product has a signal peptide of 27 residues, and that the mature protein has 207 residues. The sequence is similar to the catalytic domain of AXE I from Trichoderma reesei (67% residue identity) and putative active site residues are conserved, but the Penicillium enzyme lacks the linker and cellulose binding domain, thus explaining why it does not bind cellulose in contrast to the Trichoderma enzyme. These results point to a possible common ancestor gene for the active site domain, while the linker and the binding domain may have been added to the Trichoderma esterase by gene fusion. 
9931476	19990205	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Molecular characterization of a novel beta-1,3-exoglucanase related to mycoparasitism of Trichoderma harzianum.	Trichoderma harzianum, a soil-borne filamentous fungus, is capable of parasitizing several plant pathogenic fungi. Secretion of lytic enzymes, mainly glucanases and chitinases, is considered the most crucial step of the mycoparasitic process. The lytic enzymes degrade the cell walls of the pathogenic fungi, enabling Trichoderma to utilize both their cell walls and cellular contents for nutrition. We have purified a 110kDa novel extracellular beta-1,3-exoglucanase from T. harzianum, grown with laminarin or in dual cultures with host fungi. The corresponding gene, lam1.3, and its cDNA were isolated and their nucleotide sequences determined. The deduced amino-acid sequence predicted a molecular mass of 110.7kDa of a mature protein excluding a signal peptide. LAM1.3 showed high homology to EXG1, a beta-1,3-exoglucanase of the phytopathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum, and a lower homology to BGN13.1, a beta-1,3-endoglucanase isolated from T. harzianum. However, it contains a unique C-terminal embodying cysteine motifs. The expression of lam1.3 in growth with laminarin, but not with glucose, was found to be a result of differential accumulation of the corresponding mRNA. 
8509335	19930601	J._Bacteriol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	SSG1, a gene encoding a sporulation-specific 1,3-beta-glucanase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the meiotic process is accompanied by a large increase in 1,3-beta-glucan-degradative activity. The molecular cloning of the gene (SSG1) encoding a sporulation-specific exo-1,3-beta-glucanase was achieved by screening a genomic library with a DNA probe obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification using synthetic oligonucleotides designed according to the nucleotide sequence predicted from the amino-terminal region of the purified protein. DNA sequencing indicates that the SSG1 gene specifies a 445-amino-acid polypeptide (calculated molecular mass, 51.8 kDa) showing extensive similarity to the extracellular exo-1,3-beta-glucanases encoded by the EXG1 gene (C. R. Vazquez de Aldana, J. Correa, P. San Segundo, A. Bueno, A. R. Nebreda, E. Mendez, and F. del Rey, Gene 97:173-182, 1991). The N-terminal domain of the putative precursor is a very hydrophobic segment with structural features resembling those of signal peptides of secreted proteins. Northern (RNA) analysis reveals a unique SSG1-specific transcript, 1.7 kb long, which can be detected only in sporulating diploids (MATa/MAT alpha) but does not appear in vegetatively growing cells or in nonsporulating diploids (MAT alpha/MAT alpha) when incubated under nitrogen starvation conditions. The meiotic time course of SSG1 induction indicates that the gene is transcribed only in the late stages of the process, beginning at the time of meiosis I and reaching a maximum during spore formation. Homozygous ssg1/ssg1 mutant diploids are able to complete sporulation, although with a significant delay in the appearance of mature asci. 
16944135	20060901	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	A novel GH43 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Humicola insolens: mode of action and synergy with GH51 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases on wheat arabinoxylan.	A novel alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase (alpha-AraF) belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 43 was cloned from Humicola insolens and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae. (1)H-NMR analysis revealed that the novel GH43 enzyme selectively hydrolysed (1-->3)-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residues of doubly substituted xylopyranosyl residues in arabinoxylan and in arabinoxylan-derived oligosaccharides. The optimal activity of the cloned enzyme was at pH 6.7 and 53 degrees C. Two other novel alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases (alpha-AraFs), both belonging to GH family 51, were cloned from H. insolens and from the white-rot basidiomycete Meripilus giganteus. Both GH51 enzymes catalysed removal of (1-->2) and (1-->3)-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residues from singly substituted xylopyranosyls in arabinoxylan; the highest arabinose yields were obtained with the M. giganteus enzyme. Combinations (50:50) of the GH43 alpha-AraF from H. insolens and the GH51 alpha-AraFs from either M. giganteus or H. insolens resulted in a synergistic increase in arabinose release from water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan in extended reactions at pH 6 and 40 degrees C. This synergistic interaction between GH43 and GH51 alpha-AraFs was also evident when a GH43 alpha-AraF from a Bifidobacterium sp. was supplemented in combination with either of the GH51 enzymes. The synergistic effect is presumed to be a result of the GH51 alpha-AraFs being able to catalyse the removal of single-sitting (1-->2)-alpha-L- arabinofuranosyls that resulted after the GH43 enzyme had catalysed the removal of (1-->3)-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residues on doubly substituted xylopyranosyls in the wheat arabinoxylan. 
22684857	20120612	Biotechnol._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485 	Controlled feeding of hydrogen peroxide as oxygen source improves production of 5-ketofructose from L-sorbose using engineered pyranose 2-oxidase from Peniophora gigantea.	5-Keto-D-fructose is a useful starting material for the synthesis of pyrrolidine iminosugars. It can be prepared by regioselective oxidation of L-sorbose using pyranose 2-oxidase (P2Ox) and O(2) as a cosubstrate. As the solubility of O(2) in aqueous solution is low and the affinity of P2Ox for O(2) is poor, we developed a new and efficient process for the production of 5-keto-D-fructose based on engineered P2Ox from Peniophora gigantea and in situ generation of O(2) from H(2) O(2) with catalase. This kind of oxygen supply required efficient mixing of the bioreactor which was achieved by controlled feeding of H(2) O(2) close to the impeller tip where energy dissipation rate is highest. Thus bubbling, known to affect enzyme stability, was largely avoided, and the process could be run up to 145% oxygen super-saturation which speeds-up P2Ox activity. Under these conditions quantitative oxidation of 180 g L(-1) L-sorbose to 5-keto-D-fructose could be achieved within 4 h, resulting in a threefold higher overall productivity of the process compared to a process using gaseous oxygen supply. In addition, in situ generation of O(2) from H(2) O(2) lowered the oxygen demand of the process by a factor of 100 compared to gaseous oxygen supply.

Endoglucanases are enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose and are important components of the cellulolytic complex. In contrast to other members of the complex, they cleave internal β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in the cellulose polymer, allowing cellulose to be used as an energy source. Since biomass is an important renewable source of energy, the structural and functional characterization of these enzymes is of interest. In this study, endoglucanase III from Trichoderma harzianum was produced in Pichia pastoris and purified. Crystals belonging to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 47.54, b = 55.57, c = 157.3 Å, were obtained by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method and an X-ray diffraction data set was collected to 2.07 Å resolution. 
23525113	20130326	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Crystal structure and computational characterization of the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase GH61D from the Basidiomycota fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	Carbohydrate structures are modified and degraded in the biosphere by a myriad of mostly hydrolytic enzymes. Recently, lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenases (LPMOs) were discovered as a new class of enzymes for cleavage of recalcitrant polysaccharides that instead employ an oxidative mechanism. LPMOs employ copper as the catalytic metal and are dependent on oxygen and reducing agents for activity. LPMOs are found in many fungi and bacteria, but to date no basidiomycete LPMO has been structurally characterized. Here we present the three-dimensional crystal structure of the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium GH61D LPMO, and, for the first time, measure the product distribution of LPMO action on a lignocellulosic substrate. The structure reveals a copper-bound active site common to LPMOs, a collection of aromatic and polar residues near the binding surface that may be responsible for regio-selectivity, and substantial differences in loop structures near the binding face compared with other LPMO structures. The activity assays indicate that this LPMO primarily produces aldonic acids. Last, molecular simulations reveal conformational changes, including the binding of several regions to the cellulose surface, leading to alignment of three tyrosine residues on the binding face of the enzyme with individual cellulose chains, similar to what has been observed for family 1 carbohydrate-binding modules. A calculated potential energy surface for surface translation indicates that P. chrysosporium GH61D exhibits energy wells whose spacing seems adapted to the spacing of cellobiose units along a cellulose chain. 
8905923	19960930	Yeast	D016428 D013485 	Cloning of the Penicillium minioluteum gene encoding dextranase and its expression in Pichia pastoris.	The DEX gene encoding an extracellular dextranase was isolated from the genomic DNA library of Penicillium minioluteum by hybridization using the dextranase cDNA as a probe. Comparison of the gene and cDNA sequences revealed that the DEX gene does not contain introns. Amino acid sequences comparison of P. minioluteum dextranase with other reported dextranases reveals a significant homology (29% identity) with a dextranase from Arthrobacter sp. CB-8. The DEX gene fragment encoding a mature protein of 574 amino acids was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris by using the SUC2 gene signal sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae under control of the alcohol oxidase-1 (AOX1) promoter. Over 3.2 g/l of enzymatically active dextranase was secreted into the medium after induction by methanol. The yeast product was indistinguishable from the native enzyme in specific activity and the N-terminus of both proteins were identical.

An extracellular xylanase (1,4-beta-D-xylan xylanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.8, endo 1,4-beta-xylanase) was found to be the major protein in the culture filtrate of Penicillium chrysogenum when grown on 1% xylan. In contrast to other microorganism no xylanase multiplicity was found in P. chrysogenum under the conditions used. This enzyme was purified to homogeneity by high performance anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. It had an M(r) of 35,000 as estimated by SDS-PAGE and was shown to be active as a monomer. No glycosylation of the protein could be detected neither by a sensitive glycostain nor by enzymatic deglycosylation studies. The enzyme hydrolyzed oat spelt and birchwood xylan randomly, yielding xylose and xylobiose as major end products. It had no cellulase, CMCase, beta-xylosidase or arabinogalactanase activity but acted on p-nitrophenylcellobioside. The pH and temperature optima for its activity were pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. Eight peptides obtained after endoproteinase LysC digestion of xylanase have been sequenced, six of them showed considerable amino acid similarity to glucanases and high M(r)/acidic xylanases from different bacteria, yeasts and fungi.

A full-length cDNA encoding 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.113) from Aspergillus saitoi was cloned. Analysis of the 1718 bp nucleotide sequence of the cDNA revealed a single open reading frame with 1539 nucleotides of 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidase gene, msdS. The predicted amino-acid sequence of 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidase consists of 513 residues with a molecular mass of 55,767 and is 70%, 26% and 35% identity with those of Penicillium citrinum 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidase, yeast alpha-mannosidase, and mouse alpha-mannosidase. The cDNA of the msdS gene has been cloned and expressed in yeast cells. To identify the activity of expression product methyl-2-O-alpha-mannopyranosyl-alpha-mannopyranoside (Man alpha 1-->2Man-OMe) was used as a substrate at pH 5.0. 
16232740	20051020	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Cloning, sequencing and expression of an alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Aspergillus sojae.	The arabinofuranosidase gene was cloned from the cDNA of Aspergillus sojae. It was found to contain an open reading frame composed of 984 base pairs (bp) and to encode 328 amino acid residues (aa). The cDNA sequence suggested that the mature enzyme is preceded by a 26-aa signal sequence and the molecular mass was predicted to be 32,749 Da. The A. sojae arabinofuranosidase consists of a single catalytic domain; it does not have a specific substrate-binding domain such as the xylan-binding domain reported in an arabinofuranosidase from Streptomyces lividans (Vincent, P. et al.: Biochem. J., 322, 845-852, 1997). The deduced amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain of the mature enzyme exhibits extensive identity with the catalytic domains of Streptomyces coelicolor (74%), Aspergillus niger (75%), S. lividans (74%), and Aspergillus tubingensis (75%), which are enzymes that belong to family 62 of the glycosyl hydrolases. The cloned AFdase gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS as a cellulose-binding domain tag fusion protein. The specific activity of the purified recombinant enzyme was 18.6 units/mg protein, which is one-fourth that of the enzyme purified from a solid-state culture of A. sojae.

The complete gene xyn// that encodes endo-1,4-beta-xylanase secreted by Aspergillus usamii E001 was cloned and sequenced. The coding region of the gene is separated by only one intron. It encodes 184 amino acid residues of a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 19.8kDa plus a signal peptide of 27 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the xyn// gene has higher similarity with those of family 11 of glycosyl hydrolases reported from other microorganisms. The mature peptide encoding cDNA was subcloned into pET-28a(+) expression vector. The recombinant plasmid was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL, and xylanase activity was measured. The expressed fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and a new specific band with molecular weight of about 20kDa was found when induced by IPTG. Enzyme activity assay verified the recombinant protein as a xylanase. A maximum activity of 49.6Umg(-1) was obtained from cellular extract of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL harboring pET-28a-xyn//. The xylanase had optimal activity at pH 4.6 and 50 degrees C. This is the first report on the cloning of a xylanase gene from A. usamii. 
3114236	19870901	J._Bacteriol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Nucleotide sequence of the glucoamylase gene GLU1 in the yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera.	The complete nucleotide sequence of the glucoamylase gene GLU1 from the yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera has been determined. The GLU1 DNA hybridized to a polyadenylated RNA of 2.1 kilobases. A single open reading frame codes for a 519-amino-acid protein which contains four potential N-glycosylation sites. The putative precursor begins with a hydrophobic segment that presumably acts as a signal sequence for secretion. Glucoamylase was purified from a culture fluid of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which had been transformed with a plasmid carrying GLU1. The molecular weight of the protein was 57,000 by both gel filtration and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein was glycosylated with asparagine-linked glycosides whose molecular weight was 2,000. The amino-terminal sequence of the protein began from the 28th amino acid residue from the first methionine of the putative precursor. The amino acid composition of the purified protein matched the predicted amino acid composition. These results confirmed that GLU1 encodes glucoamylase. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of glucoamylases from several fungi and yeast shows five highly conserved regions. One homology region is absent from the yeast enzyme and so may not be essential to glucoamylase function. 
10029988	19990225	Yeast	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of 1,3-beta-glucanase-encoding genes from non-conventional yeasts.	The molecular cloning of 1,3-beta-glucanase-encoding genes from different yeast species was achieved by screening genomic libraries with DNA probes obtained by PCR-amplification using oligonucleotides designed according to conserved regions in the EXG1, EXG2 and SSG1 genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The nucleotide sequence of the KlEXG1 (Kluyveromyces lactis), HpEXG1 (Hansenula polymorpha) and SoEXG1 (Schwanniomyces occidentalis) genes was determined. K1EXG1 consists of a 1287 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 429 amino acids (49,815 Da). HpEXG1 specifies a 435-amino acid polypeptide (49,268 Da) which contains two potential N-glycosylation sites. SoEXG1 encodes a protein of 425 residues (49,132 Da) which contains one potential site for N-linked glycosylation. Expression in S. cerevisiae of KlEXG1, SoEXG1 or HpEXG1 under control of their native promoters resulted in the secretion of active 1,3-beta-glucanases. Disruption of KlEXG1 did not result in a phenotype under laboratory conditions. Comparison of the primary translation products encoded by KlEXG1, HpEXG1 and SoEXG1 with the previously characterized exo-1,3-beta-glucanases from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans reveals that enzymes with this type of specificity constitute a family of highly conserved proteins in yeasts. KlExg1p, HpExg1p and SoExg1p contain the invariant amino acid positions which have been shown to be important in the catalytic function of family 5 glycosyl hydrolases.

The gene encoding a thermostable glucoamylase from Talaromyces emersonii was cloned and, subsequently, heterologously expressed in Aspergillus niger. This glucoamylase gene encodes a 618 amino acid long protein with a calculated molecular weight of 62,827Da. T. emersonii glucoamylase fall into glucoside hydrolase family 15, showing approximately 60% sequence similarity to glucoamylase from A. niger. The expressed enzyme shows high specific activity towards maltose, isomaltose, and maltoheptaose, having 3-6-fold elevated k(cat) compared to A. niger glucoamylase. T. emersonii glucoamylase showed significantly improved thermostability with a half life of 48h at 65 degrees C in 30% (w/v) glucose, compared to 10h for glucoamylase from A. niger. The ability of the glucoamylase to hydrolyse amylopectin at 65 degrees C is improved compared to A. niger glucoamylase, giving a significant higher final glucose yield at elevated temperatures. The increased thermal stability is thus reflected in the industrial performance, allowing T. emersonii glucoamylase to operate at a temperature higher than the A. niger enzyme. 
15757176	20050311	Mycol._Res.	D016428 	Cloning and characterization of a gene rpg1 encoding polygalacturonase of Rhizopus oryzae.	The polygalacturonase (PG)-encoding gene (rpg1) of Rhizopus oryzae, the causal pathogen of rhizopus rot of mulberry, was cloned and sequenced. PGs were partially purified from incubation mixture of 2% pectin medium and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by a gas-phase protein sequencer. RT-PCR was performed using degenerate primers designed from the amino acid sequences, which resulted in part of a PG-encoding gene being obtained. By 3'-RACE and TAIL-PCR analyses, the entire region of the PG-encoding gene was cloned and sequenced. The structural gene comprised 1199 bp coding for 383 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 26 amino acids, and the open reading frame was interrupted by single intron of 47 bp. Phylogenetic analysis using the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that R. oryzae RPG1 belonged to a clade consisting of exo-PGs of ascomycete fungi. 
9546178	19980418	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 	Structural and kinetic properties of nonglycosylated recombinant Penicillium amagasakiense glucose oxidase expressed in Escherichia coli.	The gene coding for Penicillium amagasakiense glucose oxidase (GOX; beta-D-glucose; oxygen 1-oxidoreductase [EC 1.1.3.4]) has been cloned by PCR amplification with genomic DNA as template with oligonucleotide probes derived from amino acid sequences of N- and C-terminal peptide fragments of the enzyme. Recombinant Escherichia coli expression plasmids have been constructed from the heat-induced pCYTEXP1 expression vector containing the mature GOX coding sequence. When transformed into E. coli TG2, the plasmid directed the synthesis of 0.25 mg of protein in insoluble inclusion bodies per ml of E. coli culture containing more than 60% inactive GOX. Enzyme activity was reconstituted by treatment with 8 M urea and 30 mM dithiothreitol and subsequent 100-fold dilution to a final protein concentration of 0.05 to 0.1 mg ml-1 in a buffer containing reduced glutathione-oxidized glutathione, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and glycerol. Reactivation followed first-order kinetics and was optimal at 10 degrees C. The reactivated recombinant GOX was purified to homogeneity by mild acidification and anion-exchange chromatography. Up to 12 mg of active GOX could be purified from a 1-liter E. coli culture. Circular dichroism demonstrated similar conformations for recombinant and native P. amagasakiense GOXs. The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 968 U mg-1 and exhibits kinetics of glucose oxidation similar to those of, but lower pH and thermal stabilities than, native GOX from P. amagasakiense. In contrast to the native enzyme, recombinant GOX is nonglycosylated and contains a single isoform of pI 4.5. This is the first reported expression of a fully active, nonglycosylated form of a eukaryotic, glycosylated GOX in E. coli. 
15686849	20050203	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Effects of dockerin domains on Neocallimastix frontalis xylanases.	Two xylanase genes were cloned from the anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix frontalis. Xyn11A had a modular structure of two catalytic domains and two dockerin domains, while Xyn11B had one catalytic domain and two dockerin domains. The characteristics of the xylanases with and without dockerin domains were investigated. The deletion of dockerin domains had little influence on the optimal pH of xylanases, while it significantly affected the optimal temperatures. The optimal temperatures increased from 55 to 60 degrees C for Xyn11A and 60 to 65 degrees C for Xyn11B after the deletion of dockerin domains. The increase of optimal temperatures was attributed to the lower stability of the second structure in full length xylanase than that in the truncated one as evidenced by the circular dichroism spectroscopy. The specific activity of Xyn11A and Xyn11B increased about 64% and 330%, respectively, after the deletion of the dockerin domains. The removal of dockerin domains appeared to increase the overall efficiency of Xyn11A' (1.2-) and Xyn11B' (2.9-) fold with oat spelts xylan as reflected by the values of k(cat)/K(m). The results suggest that the dockerin domain might play an important role in the characteristics of xylanases from anaerobic fungi. 
9990729	19990217	J._Biotechnol.	D003160 D016428 	Comparison of gene structures and enzymatic properties between two endoglucanases from Humicola grisea.	We have cloned two endoglucanase genes (egl3 and egl4) from a thermophilic fungus, Humicola grisea. The coding region of the egl3 gene was interrupted by an intron of 56-bp, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the egl3 gene was 305 amino acids in length and showed 98.4% identity with Humicola insolens EGV. The coding region of the egl4 gene was also interrupted by an intron of 173-bp, which contains 34 TTC repeated sequence units, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the egl4 gene was 227 amino acids in length and showed 61.5% identity with H. grisea EGL3. The typical hinge and the cellulose-binding domain were observed in the C-terminal region of EGL3, but they were not observed in EGL4. In the 5' upstream region of both genes, there were a TATA box or its similar sequence, CAAT motifs, and 6-bp sites which are identical or similar to the consensus sequence for binding a catabolite repressor CREA in Aspergillus nidulans. The egl3 and the egl4 genes were expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, and the translation products were purified. The fusion protein, EGL4CBD, which consists of a catalytic domain of EGL4 and the C-terminal region of EGL3, was also constructed and produced by A. oryzae, and purified. These enzymes showed relatively high activity toward carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and could not hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside. The positive effect of substituting the C-terminal region of EGL4 with that of EGL3 was observed in the hydrolysis of CMC. 
7811079	19941201	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation, characterization, and analysis of the expression of the cbhII gene of Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	Two cDNA sequences representing putative allelic variants of the Phanerochaete chrysosporium cbhII gene were isolated by hybridization to the Trichoderma reesei cbhII gene. Both of the equivalent genomic sequences were subsequently isolated by the inverse PCR technique. DNA sequencing showed that the cbhII open reading frame of 1,380 bp codes for a putative polypeptide of 460 amino acids which is interrupted by six introns. The domain structure found in T. reesei cbhII is conserved in the equivalent P. chrysosporium protein. The overall similarity between the two gene products is 54%, with the region of highest conservation being found in the cellulose-binding domain (65%). Unlike the cbhI gene of P. chrysosporium, cbhII does not appear to be a member of a class of closely related genes. CBHII is a new member of family B of the beta-1, 4-glucanases. Alignment of the P. chrysosporium and T. reesei CBHII protein sequences showed that all of the residues important for the formation of the extended loops of the catalytic domain and those residues that are involved in the catalytic action of the T. reesei enzyme are also present in the P. chrysosporium equivalent. The profiles of cbh gene expression in P. chrysosporium reveal that while cbhI.1 and cbhI.2 could be coregulated, cbhII can be independently controlled. The latter is so far the only cellulase gene found to be expressed when the fungus is grown on oat spelt arabinoxylan, suggesting that it may play an active role in the xylanolytic as well as the cellulolytic systems. 
9761741	19981008	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	Crystal structure of the family 7 endoglucanase I (Cel7B) from Humicola insolens at 2.2 A resolution and identification of the catalytic nucleophile by trapping of the covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate.	Cellulose is the major polysaccharide component of the plant cell wall and the most abundant naturally produced macromolecule on Earth. The enzymic degradation of cellulose, by cellulases, is therefore of great environmental and commercial significance. Cellulases are found in 12 of the glycoside hydrolase families classified according to their amino acid sequence similarities. Endoglucanase I (Cel7B), from the soft-rot fungus Humicola insolens, is a family 7 enzyme. The structure of the native form of Cel7B from H. insolens at 2.2 A resolution has been solved by molecular replacement using the known Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I [Divne, Ståhlberg, Reinikainen, Ruohonen, Pettersson, Knowles, Teeri and Jones (1994) Science 265, 524-528] structure as the search model. Cel7B catalyses hydrolysis of the beta-1,4 glycosidic linkages in cellulose with net retention of anomeric configuration. The catalytic nucleophile at the active site of Cel7B has been identified as Glu-197 by trapping of a 2-deoxy-2-fluorocellotriosyl enzyme intermediate and identification of the labelled peptide in peptic digests by tandem MS. Site-directed mutagenesis of both Glu-197 and the prospective catalytic acid, Glu-202, results in inactive enzyme, confirming the critical role of these groups for catalysis.

Two isoforms of acidic 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidases have been isolated from culture filtrate of Penicillium citrinum. The pI values of the two forms, designated 1,2-alpha-mannosidase Ia and Ib, were 4.6 and 4.7 respectively. Isoenzymes Ia and Ib exhibited the same molecular mass which was determined to be 53 kDa by SDS/PAGE and 54 kDa by gel-permeation chromatography. Enzymes Ia and Ib hydrolysed yeast mannan and 1,2-alpha-linked mannooligosaccharides, but did not hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-mannoside. The optimal pH for the hydrolysis of Man(alpha 1-->2)Man was 5.0 for both isoenzymes. Similar kinetic parameters were determined for the two forms. Activation energy was a little lower for Ia than Ib. There was little difference between the enzymes with regard to their performance at acidic or alkaline pH. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two enzymes were identical. Analysis of C-terminal peptides, which were prepared by tryptic digestion and anhydrotrypsin-agarose chromatography, showed that Ia and Ib had the same amino acid sequences in the C-terminal region. Tryptic digestion revealed a slight difference between the isoenzymes in the pattern of cleaved peptides on SDS/PAGE. 
8679110	19960601	Biotechnol._Appl._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of a novel esterase induced by growth of Aspergillus niger on sugar-beet pulp.	An inducible esterase has been isolated from a liquid culture of Aspergillus niger grown on sugar-beet pulp. The enzyme was active on methyl esters of cinnamic acids, caffeic > p-coumaric > ferulic, and is therefore termed a cinnamoyl esterase. The enzyme was not active on methyl sinapinate, a good substrate for ferulic acid esterase III, which was purified previously from A. niger [Faulds and Williamson (1994) Microbiology 140, 779-787]. With methyl caffeate as substrate the enzyme had temperature and pH optima of 50 degrees C and 6.0 respectively, and a specific activity of 96.9 units per mg of protein. The purified protein (native molecular mass 145 000 Da) gave a single heavily stained band on SDS/PAGE, suggesting the protein was a dimer, and seemed to be heavily glycosylated. Isoelectric focusing gave a single band corresponding to a pl of 4.80. The pure enzyme was free of other carbohydrase activities. The activity of the pure enzyme was inhibited by more than 99% after treatment with the serine-specific protease inhibitor aminoethylbenzenesulphonylfluoride (1 mM) for 12 h. The enzyme was capable of releasing ferulic acid from sugar beet pulp.

D016428 D013485 	Recombinant expression and characterization of an endoglucanase III  (cel12a) from  Trichoderma harzianum (Hypocreaceae)  in the yeast Pichia pastoris.	Filamentous fungi from the genus Trichoderma have  been widely investigated due to their considerable production of important  biotechnological enzymes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the T.  harzianum strain IOC-3844 has a high degree of cellulolytic activity. After  excluding the native signal peptide, the open reading frame of the T.  harzianum endoglucanase III enzyme was cloned in the expression vector  pPICZαA, enabling protein secretion to the  culture medium. The recombinant plasmid was used to transform Pichia  pastoris. Recombinant expression in the selected clone yielded 300 mg pure  enzyme per liter of induced medium. The recombinant enzyme proved to be active  in a qualitative analysis using Congo red. A quantitative assay, using  dinitrosalicylic acid, revealed a high degree of activity at pH 5.5 and around  48°C. This information contributes to our understanding of the cellulolytic  repertory of T. harzianum and the determination of a set of enzymes that  can be incorporated into mixes for second-generation ethanol production. 
12843664	20030705	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of laminaran hydrolases from Trichoderma viride.	At least three extracellular laminaran hydrolases which hydrolyzed laminaran (beta-1,3:1,6-glucan) from Eisenia bicyclis were secreted in wheat bran solid medium by Trichoderma viride U-1. These three enzymes, lam AI, AII, and B, were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Their molecular masses were estimated to be 70.1, 70.4, and 45.0 kDa for lam AI, AII, and B, respectively, by SDS-PAGE. Whereas both lam AI and AII could hydrolyze laminarin from Laminaria digitata, lam AII showed higher activity against Laminaria laminarin rather than Eisenia laminaran. On the other hand, lam B preferentially hydrolyzed pustulan, a beta-1,6-glucan. Laminarioligosaccharide was hydrolyzed by lam AI and AII but not B, whereas gentiooligosaccharide was hydrolyzed by only lam B. It showed that lam AI and AII were specific for beta-1,3-linkages, but lam B was specific for beta-1,6-linkages. These results indicated that T. viride U-1 has a multiple glucanolytic enzyme system. 
1934116	19910701	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Molecular cloning and characterization of a Candida tsukubaensis alpha-glucosidase gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	The molecular cloning of an alpha-glucosidase gene isolated from a Candida tsukubaensis (CBS 6389) genomic library in Saccharomyces cervisiae is reported. The cloned gene is contained within a 6.2 kb Sau3A DNA fragment and directs the synthesis and secretion of an amylolytic enzyme into the extracellular medium of the recombinant host, S. cerevisiae. The cloned enzyme was found to have an unusually broad substrate specificity and is capable of hydrolysing alpha-1,2, alpha-1,3, alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 linked, as well as aryl and alkyl, D-glucosides. On the basis of its substrate specificity profile, the cloned enzyme was classified as an alpha-glucosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.20). It has a pH optimum in the range 4.2-4.6, a temperature optimum of 58 degrees C and is readily inactivated at pasteurization temperature (60 degrees C). Southern blot analysis failed to reveal any homology between the cloned gene and genomic DNA isolated from other well characterized amylolytic yeasts. A rapid plate-assay, based on the utilization of a chromogenic substrate X-alpha-D-glucoside to detect the expression of the cloned alpha-glucosidase in S. cerevisiae transformants, was developed. 
10779688	20000426	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 	Inverting character of alpha-glucuronidase A from Aspergillus tubingensis.	Alpha-glucuronidase A from Aspergillus tubingensis was found to be capable of liberating 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) only from those beechwood glucuronoxylan fragments in which the acid is attached to the non-reducing terminal xylopyranosyl residue. Reduced aldotetrauronic acid, 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronosyl-alpha-1,2-D-xylopyranosyl-beta-1,4-xylopyranosyl-beta-1,4-xylitol, was found to be a suitable substrate to follow the stereochemical course of the hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by the purified enzyme. The configuration of the liberated MeGlcA was followed in a D(2)O reaction mixture by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. It was unambiguously established that MeGlcA was released from the substrate as its beta-anomer from which the alpha-anomer was formed on mutarotation. This result represents the first experimental evidence for the inverting character of a microbial alpha-glucuronidase, a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 67 (EC 3.1.1.139). 
14735222	20040122	Can._J._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Expression and characterization of the 42 kDa chitinase of the biocontrol fungus Metarhizium anisopliae in Escherichia coli.	Albeit Metarhizium anisopliae is the best-characterized entomopathogenic fungus, the role of some hydrolytic enzymes during host cuticle penetration has not yet been established. Three chitinase genes (chit1, chi2, chi3) from Metarhizium have already been isolated. To characterize the chitinase coded by the chit1 gene, we expressed the active protein (CHIT42) in Escherichia coli using a T7-based promoter expression vector. The recombinant protein, CHIT42, is active against glycol chitin and synthetic N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) dimer and tetramer substrates. These activities suggest that the recombinant CHIT42 acts as an endochitinase. 
8664505	19951101	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Fungal pathogens of oat roots and tomato leaves employ closely related enzymes to detoxify different host plant saponins.	Antifungal saponins are produced by many plants and have been implicated as preformed determinants of resistance to fungal attack. The importance of saponin detoxification in fungal pathogenesis has recently been demonstrated for the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. avenae, which produces the enzyme avenacinase. Avenacinase detoxifies the triterpenoid oat root saponin avenacin A-1, and is essential for pathogenicity of G. graminis var.avenae to oats. Here we demonstrate an unexpected relatedness between avenacinase and the tomatinase enzyme produced by Septoria lycopersici (a tomato leaf-infecting fungus), which acts on the steroidal glycoalkaloid alpha-tomatine. The two enzymes share common physicochemical properties and are immunologically cross-reactive; however, there are critical differences in their substrate specificities which reflect the host preferences of the fungi from which the enzymes were purified. The DNA encoding tomatinase was isolated from a S. lycopersici cDNA library using avenacinase DNA as a probe. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of avenacinase and tomatinase revealed that the enzymes are clearly similar. 
1952950	19911201	Arch._Biochem._Biophys.	D016428 D013487 	Heterologous expression and characterization of an active lignin peroxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium using recombinant baculovirus.	The cDNA clone lambda ML-1 encoding one of the extracellular lignin peroxidases from the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, was heterologously expressed in an active form using a recombinant baculovirus system. The glycosylated extracellular form of the recombinant protein contained the ferriprotoporphyrin IX moiety and was capable of oxidizing both iodide and the model lignin compound, veratryl alcohol. In comparative peroxidase assays using guaiacol and Mn(II), the recombinant lignin peroxidase did not appear to be Mn(II) dependent. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the heterologously expressed peroxidase had an apparent molecular weight similar to that of the native fungal isozyme H8. The elution profile of the active recombinant enzyme derived by ion-exchange chromatography and immunoblot analysis using an anti-H8 monoclonal antibody provided further evidence that the lambda ML-1 DNA encodes the lignin peroxidase H8. 
15998308	20050707	Plant_J.	D016428 D013485 	Necrotizing activity of five Botrytis cinerea endopolygalacturonases produced in Pichia pastoris.	Five Botrytis cinerea endopolygalacturonase enzymes (BcPGs) were individually expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified to homogeneity and biochemically characterized. While the pH optima of the five enzymes were similar (approximately pH 4.5) the maximum activity of individual enzymes differed significantly. For hydrolysis of polygalacturonic acid (PGA), the V(max,app) ranged from 10 to 900 U mg(-1), while the K(m,app) ranged from 0.16 to 0.6 mg ml(-1). Although all BcPGs are true endopolygalacturonases, they apparently have different modes of action. PGA hydrolysis by BcPG1, BcPG2 and BcPG4 leads to the transient accumulation of oligomers with DP < 7, whereas PGA hydrolysis by BcPG3 and BcPG6 leads to the immediate accumulation of monomers and dimers. The necrotizing activity (NA) of all BcPGs was tested separately in tomato, broad bean and Arabidopsis thaliana. They showed different NAs on these plants. BcPG1 and BcPG2 possessed the strongest NA as tissue collapse was observed within 10 min after infiltration of broad bean leaves. The amino acid (aa) D192A substitution in the active site of BcPG2 not only abolished enzyme activity but also the NA, indicating that the NA is dependent on enzyme activity. Furthermore, deletion of the Bcpg2 gene in B. cinerea resulted in a strong reduction in virulence on tomato and broad bean. Primary lesion formation was delayed by approximately 24 h and the lesion expansion rate was reduced by 50-85%. These data indicate that BcPG2 is an important virulence factor for B. cinerea.

Hydrolytic enzymes responsible for laminarin degradation were found to be secreted during growth of Ustilago esculenta on laminarin. An enzyme involved in laminarin degradation was purified by assaying release of glucose from laminaribiose. Ion-exchange chromatography of the culture filtrate followed by size-exclusion chromatography yielded a 110-kDa protein associated with laminaribiose hydrolysis. LC/MS/MS analysis of the 110-kDa protein identified three peptide sequences that shared significant similarity with a putative glucoside hydrolase family (GH) 3 β-glucosidase in Ustilago maydis. Based on the DNA sequence of the U. maydis GH3 β-glucosidase, a gene encoding a putative GH3 β-glucosidase in U. esculenta (Uebgl3A) was cloned by PCR. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, the protein encoded by Uebgl3A has a molecular mass of 91 kDa and shares 90% identity with U. maydis GH3 β-glucosidase. Recombinant UeBgl3A expressed in Aspergillus oryzae released glucose from β-1,3-, β-1,4-, and β-1,6-linked oligosaccharides, and from 1,3-1,4-β-glucan and laminarin polysaccharides, indicating that UeBgl3A is a β-glucosidase. Kinetic analysis showed that UeBgl3A preferentially hydrolyzed laminaritriose and laminaritetraose. These results suggest that UeBgl3A is a key enzyme that produces glucose from laminarioligosaccharides during growth of U. esculenta on laminarin.

D003160 D016428 	Structure of two fungal beta-1,4-galactanases: searching for the basis for temperature and pH optimum.	beta-1,4-Galactanases hydrolyze the galactan side chains that are part of the complex carbohydrate structure of the pectin. They are assigned to family 53 of the glycoside hydrolases and display significant variations in their pH and temperature optimum and stability. Two fungal beta-1,4-galactanases from Myceliophthora thermophila and Humicola insolens have been cloned and heterologously expressed, and the crystal structures of the gene products were determined. The structures are compared to the previously only known family 53 structure of the galactanase from Aspergillus aculeatus (AAGAL) showing approximately 56% identity. The M. thermophila and H. insolens galactanases are thermophilic enzymes and are most active at neutral to basic pH, whereas AAGAL is mesophilic and most active at acidic pH. The structure of the M. thermophila galactanase (MTGAL) was determined from crystals obtained with HEPES and TRIS buffers to 1.88 A and 2.14 A resolution, respectively. The structure of the H. insolens galactanase (HIGAL) was determined to 2.55 A resolution. The thermostability of MTGAL and HIGAL correlates with increase in the protein rigidity and electrostatic interactions, stabilization of the alpha-helices, and a tighter packing. An inspection of the active sites in the three enzymes identifies several amino acid substitutions that could explain the variation in pH optimum. Examination of the activity as a function of pH for the D182N mutant of AAGAL and the A90S/ H91D mutant of MTGAL showed that the difference in pH optimum between AAGAL and MTGAL is at least partially associated with differences in the nature of residues at positions 182, 90, and/or 91. 
17277884	20070206	Acta_Biochim._Biophys._Sin._(Shanghai)	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, sequencing and expression analysis of the first cellulase gene encoding cellobiohydrolase 1 from a cold-adaptive Penicillium chrysogenum FS010.	A cellobiohydrolase 1 gene (cbh1) was cloned from Penicillium chrysogenum FS010 by a modified thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR). DNA sequencing shows that cbh1 has an open reading frame of 1590 bp, encoding a putative protein of 529 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that CBHI has a modular structure with a predicted molecular mass of 56 kDa and consists of a fungal type carbohydrate binding module separated from a catalytic domain by a threonine rich linker region. The putative gene product is homologous to fungal cellobiohydrolases in Family 7 of the glycosyl hydrolases. A novel cbh1 promoter (1.3 kb) was also cloned and sequenced, which contains seven putative binding sites (5'-SYGGRG-3') for the carbon catabolite repressor CRE1. Effect of various carbon sources to the cbh1 transcription of P. chrysogenum was examined by Northern analysis, suggesting that the expression of cbh1 is regulated at transcriptional level. The cbh1 gene in cold-adaptive fungus P. chysogenum was expressed as an active enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae H158. The recombinant CBHI accumulated intracellularly and could not be secreted into the medium. 
22835655	20120728	J._Environ._Manage.	D016428 D013485 	Identification of metabolites from benzo[a]pyrene oxidation by ligninolytic enzymes of Polyporus sp. S133.	The biodegradation of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) by using Polyporus sp. S133, a white-rot fungus isolated from oil-contaminated soil was investigated. Approximately 73% of the initial concentration of BaP was degraded within 30 d of incubation. The isolation and characterization of 3 metabolites by thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, and UV-vis spectrophotometry in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, indicated that Polyporus sp. S133 transformed BaP to BaP-1,6-quinone. This quinone was further degraded in 2 ways. First, BaP-1,6-quinone was decarboxylated and oxidized to form coumarin, which was then hydroxylated to hydroxycoumarin, and finally to hydroxyphenyl acetic acid by addition of an epoxide group. Second, Polyporus sp. S133 converted BaP-1,6-quinone into a major product, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. During degradation, free extracellular laccase was detected with reduced activity of lignin peroxidase, manganese-dependent peroxidase and 2,3-dioxygenase, suggesting that laccase and 1,2-dioxygenase might play an important role in the transformation of PAHs compounds.

Potato pulp is a high-volume side-stream from industrial potato starch manufacturing. Enzymatically solubilized β-1,4-galactan-rich potato pulp polysaccharides of molecular weights >100 kDa (SPPP) are highly bifidogenic in human fecal sample fermentations in vitro. The objective of the present study was to use potato β-1,4-galactan and the SPPP as substrates for enzymatic production of potentially prebiotic compounds of lower and narrower molecular weight. A novel endo-1,4-β-galactanase from Emericella nidulans (anamorph Aspergillus nidulans), GH family 53, was produced in a recombinant Pichia pastoris strain. The enzyme was purified by Cu(2+) affinity chromatography and its optimal reaction conditions were determined to pH 5 and 49°C via a statistical experimental design. The specific activity of the E. nidulans enzyme expressed in P. pastoris was similar to that of an endo-1,4-β-galactanase from Aspergillus niger used as benchmark. The E. nidulans enzyme expressed in P. pastoris generated a spectrum poly- and oligo-saccharides which were fractionated by membrane filtration. The potential growth promoting properties of each fraction were evaluated by growth of beneficial gut microbes and pathogenic bacteria. All the galactan- and SPPP-derived products promoted the growth of probiotic strains of Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus and generally did not support the propagation of Clostridium perfringens in single culture fermentations. Notably the growth of B. longum was significantly higher (p<0.05) or at least as good on galactan- and SPPP-derived products as fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Except in one case these products did not support the growth of the pathogen Cl. perfringens to any significant extent. 
1840529	19910902	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and sequencing of the inulinase gene of Kluyveromyces marxianus var. marxianus ATCC 12424.	Cell wall inulinase (EC 3.2.1.7) was purified from Kluyveromyces marxianus var. marxianus (formerly K. fragilis) and its N-terminal 33-amino acid sequence was established. PCR amplification of cDNA with 2 sets of degenerate primers yielded a genomic probe which was then used to screen a genomic library established in the YEp351 yeast shuttle vector. One of the selected recombinant plasmids allowed an invertase-negative Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant to grow on inulin. It was shown to contain an inulinase gene (INU 1) encoding a 555-amino acid precursor protein with a typical N-terminal signal peptide. The sequence of inulinase displays a high similarity (67%) to S. cerevisiae invertase, suggesting a common evolutionary origin for yeast beta-fructosidases with different substrate preferences. 
9450333	19980205	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D016428 	Cloning, expression, and role in pathogenicity of pg1 encoding the major extracellular endopolygalacturonase of the vascular wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum.	pg1 encoding the major in vitro extracellular endopolygalacturonase of the tomato vascular wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici was cloned and sequenced. The deduced mature protein had a calculated molecular mass of 35.5 kDa and a pI of 6.2, and showed significant similarity with other fungal endoPGs. pg1 mRNA was induced in vitro by citrus pectin, tomato vascular tissue, 0.1% D-galacturonic acid, and polygalacturonic acid, and repressed by 1% D-galacturonic acid and 1% glucose. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed pg1 expression in roots and lower stems of tomato plants infected by F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Three naturally occurring F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis isolates deficient in PG1 were transformed with the cloned gene. The PG1 enzyme secreted by the transformants had the same molecular mass, pI, and glycosylation pattern as those of the donor isolate. Polygalacturonase activity in cultures of transformants grown in vitro on citrus pectin and on melon plants, but not on glucose, increased 10- to 20-fold, compared with the PG1-deficient wild-type isolate, whereas mycelial dry weight increased two- to three-fold. Transformants exhibited the same degree of virulence toward susceptible muskmelon cultivars as the wild-type isolate and were avirulent on a resistant cultivar. 
7896713	19950401	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of an endo-beta-1,6-glucanase from Trichoderma harzianum that is related to its mycoparasitism.	The enzymes from Trichoderma species that degrade fungal cell walls have been suggested to play an important role in mycoparasitic action against fungal plant pathogens. The mycoparasite Trichoderma harzianum produces at least two extracellular beta-1,6-glucanases, among other hydrolases, when it is grown on chitin as the sole carbon source. One of these extracellular enzymes was purified to homogeneity after adsorption to its substrate, pustulan, chromatofocusing, and, finally, gel filtration. The apparent molecular mass was 43,000, and the isoelectric point was 5.8. The first 15 amino acids from the N terminus of the purified protein have been sequenced. The enzyme was specific for beta-1,6 linkages and showed an endolytic mode of action on pustulan. Further characterization indicated that the enzyme by itself releases soluble sugars and produces hydrolytic halli on yeast cell walls. When combined with other T. harzianum cell wall-degrading enzymes such as beta-1,3-glucanases and chitinases, it hydrolyzes filamentous fungal cell walls. The enzyme acts cooperatively with the latter enzymes, inhibiting the growth of the fungi tested. Antibodies against the purified protein also indicated that the two identified beta-1,6-glucanases are not immunologically related and are probably encoded by two different genes. 
8169213	19940501	J._Bacteriol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and expression of the Candida albicans beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (HEX1) gene.	beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase was purified from the spent culture medium of Candida albicans A72 grown in the presence of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein was determined, two degenerate oligonucleotide probes were constructed, and a 3.9-kb BamHI fragment of DNA that hybridized to both probes was subcloned from a lambda EMBL4 library of C. albicans A72 genomic DNA. This fragment of DNA contained the entire beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (HEX1) gene, which consisted of an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide precursor of 562 amino acids with a putative 22-amino-acid leader sequence. The deduced HEX1 amino acid sequence showed similarity to hexosaminidases from a variety of organisms. Growth of C. albicans on GlcNAc induced transcription of HEX1, resulting in increased specific beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. HEX1 mRNA (2.35 kb) from GlcNAc-grown cells was approximately 200 bp larger than HEX1 mRNA from cells grown on glucose. This size difference was suggested to result from the use of alternative transcription termination sites. The cloned HEX1 gene introduced into C. albicans SGY-243 on a plasmid also responded to GlcNAc induction. 
9836430	19981204	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of extracellular and cell wall bound beta-glucosidases from Aspergillus kawachii.	We isolated two extracellular beta-glucosidases (EX-1: 145 kDa, EX-2: 130 kDa) and one cell wall bound beta-glucosidase (CB-1: 120 kDa) from Aspergillus kawachii and characterized their physical and kinetic properties. From the results of N-terminal amino acid sequence, enzymatic parameters and deglycosylation of the three purified enzymes, we strongly suggest that these three enzymes were products of the same gene, modified by different degree of glycosylation. All three purified beta-glucosidases adsorbed to the purified cell wall fraction of this strain. This association could dramatically improve the stability of purified enzymes. These three purified beta-glucosidases were readily inactivated even in moderate conditions but became very stable upon the addition of the purified cell wall fraction. The all purified beta-glucosidases were stable in the range of pH 2.0-9.0 and stable below 30 degrees C with 2 mg/ml of the purified cell wall fraction. 
15555935	20041124	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Expression of chitin deacetylase from Colletotrichum lindemuthianum in Pichia pastoris: purification and characterization.	The chitin deacetylase gene from Colletotrichum lindemuthianum UPS9 was isolated and cloned in Pichia pastoris as a tagged protein with six added terminal histidine residues. The expressed enzyme was recovered from the culture supernatant and further characterized. A single-step purification based on specific binding of the histidine residues was achieved. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of 25 kDa and is not glycosylated as determined by mass spectrometry. The activity of the recombinant chitin deacetylase on chitinous substrates was investigated. With chitotetraose as substrate, the optimum temperature and pH for enzyme activity are 60 degrees C and 8.0, respectively. The specific activity of the pure protein is 72 U/mg. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 micromol of acetate per minute under the assay conditions employed. The enzyme activity is enhanced in the presence of Co2+ ions. A possible use of the recombinant chitin deacetylase for large-scale biocatalytic conversion of chitin to chitosan is discussed. 
18944813	20081024	Phytopathology	D016428 	The Xylanolytic System of Claviceps purpurea: Cytological Evidence for Secretion of Xylanases in Infected Rye Tissue and Molecular Characterization of Two Xylanase Genes.	ABSTRACT Claviceps purpurea is a common phytopathogenic fungus that colonizes ovarian tissue of grasses. A concerted approach involving cytological and molecular techniques was initiated to investigate the role of the fungus' xylanolytic system in the interaction. Using enzyme-gold and immuno-gold electron-microscopic techniques, the presence of arabinoxylans in cell walls of rye ovarian tissues (i.e., along the usual path of infection of C. purpurea) was confirmed; tissue-print and immunostaining analyses indicated the presence of xylanase(s) exclusively in ovaries infected with C. purpurea. This strongly suggests that C. purpurea secretes xylanase while colonizing its host. Two xylanase genes (cpxyl1 and cpxyl2) were isolated from a genomic library of C. purpurea using genes from Cochliobolus carbonum (xyl1) and Magnaporthe grisea (xyn33) as heterologous probes. cpxyl1 of C. purpurea had an open reading frame (ORF) of 832 bp interrupted by a 181-bp intron. The derived gene product (CPXYL1) had a molecular mass of 21.5 kDa and an pI of 8.88; it showed significant homology to family G endo-beta-1,4-xylanases. The cpxyl2 ORF (1,144 bp) contained two introns (76 and 90 bp) and coded for a polypeptide of 33.8 kDa with an pI of 7.01; CPXYL2 belonged to family F xylanases. Southern analyses with genomic DNA demonstrated that both genes were single-copy genes. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, it could be shown that both genes were expressed in vitro and in planta (during all infection stages). Inactivation of cpxyl1 was achieved by a gene-replacement approach. The mutant strain (Deltacpxyl1) had significantly reduced xylanase activity; Western analyses confirmed that it lacked a polypeptide of approximately 23 kDa. 
2277031	19900901	J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and sequencing of the endo-cellulase cDNA from Robillarda sp. Y-20.	An endo-cellulase cDNA has been screened from a Robillarda sp. Y-20 cDNA expression library using polyclonal antibodies (immunoscreening). Western blot analysis showed that recombinant CMCase I fused to beta-galactosidase with the molecular weight of approximately 150,000 was expressed in Escherichia coli Y1090. Sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA revealed that it consisted of 1,136 nucleotides. By comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein (residues 1 to 18, determined by protein sequencing), the cDNA was found to lack 44 nucleotides at its 5' end corresponding to residues 1 to 15. Therefore, the mature cellulase (CMCase I) was deduced to be composed of 375 amino acid residues and the molecular weight of its protein was calculated to be 41,004. Yaguchi et al. reported that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (endo-cellulase) from Schizophyllum commune was homologous with the active site of various hen egg-white type lysozymes, and the homology offered evidence for a lysozyme-type mechanism in enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulase [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1983) 116, 408-411]. Pentillä et al. also pointed out that some amino acid homology was found between endo-glucanase I from Trichoderma reesei and the lysozyme of the phage T4 [Gene (1986) 45, 253-263]. From the result of sequence alignment of the endo-cellulase from Robillarda sp. Y-20 and four kinds of lysozymes, there was a possibility that the endo-cellulase from Robillarda sp. Y-20 also hydrolyzes carboxymethyl cellulose by a lysozyme-type mechanism. 
23268348	20121227	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, characterization and heterelogous expression of the INU1 gene from Cryptococcus aureus HYA.	The INU1 gene (Accession number: JX073660) encoding exo-inulinase from Cryptococcus aureus HYA was cloned and characterized. The gene had an open reading frame (ORF) of 1653 bp long encoding an inulinase. The coding region of the gene was not interrupted by any intron. It encoded 551 amino acid residues of a protein with a putative signal peptide of 23 amino acids and the calculated molecular mass of 59.5 kDa. The protein sequence deduced from the inulinase structural gene contained the inulinase consensus sequences (WMNDPNGL), (RDP), ECP, FS and Q. It also had two conserved putative N-glycosylation sites. The inulinase from C. aureus HYA was found to be closely related to that from Kluyveromyces marxianus and Pichia guilliermondii. The inulinase gene without the signal sequence was subcloned into pPICZaA expression vector and expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33. The expressed fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting and a specific band with molecular mass of about 60 kDa was found. Enzyme activity assay verified the recombinant protein as an inulinase. A maximum inulinase activity of 16.3±0.24 U/ml was obtained from the culture supernatant of P. pastoris X-33 harboring the inulinase gene. The optimal temperature and pH for action of the enzyme were 50 °C and 5.0, respectively. A large amount of monosaccharides were detected after the hydrolysis of inulin with the purified recombinant inulinase. 
8625430	19960401	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Endoglucanase II (EGII) of Penicillium janthinellum: cDNA sequence, heterologous expression and promotor analysis.	The cDNA coding for the endoglucanase EGII of P. janthinellum was cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame comprises 1230 nucleotides and the deduced amino-acid sequence shows an overall homology of 63% with the T. reesei egl2. The cellulose-binding domain of EGII represents a typical member of the A family of cellulases. The egl2 gene is only induced by cellulose or cellobiose and not by sophorose. A promotor fragment including 1 kb was cloned and sequenced. Three major transcription startpoints were identified. Five motifs matching the binding site of the carbon-catabolite repressor CREA of A. nidulans were detected. Their potential implication in repression was analyzed by bandshift assays. 
17664063	20070801	Mycol._Res.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of two distinct beta-glucosidase genes, bg1 and aven1, with very different biological roles from the thermophilic, saprophytic fungus Talaromyces emersonii.	Recent sequencing of a number of fungal genomes has revealed the presence of multiple putative beta-glucosidases. Here, we report the cloning of two beta-glucosidase genes (bg1 and aven1), which have very different biological functions and represent two of a number of beta-glucosidases from Talaromyces emersonii. The bg1 gene, encoding a putative intracellular beta-glucosidase, shows significant similarity to other fungal glucosidases from glycosyl hydrolase family 1, known to be involved in cellulose degradation. Solka floc, methyl-xylose, gentiobiose, beech wood xylan, and lactose induced expression of bg1, whereas glucose repressed expression. A second beta-glucosidase gene isolated from T. emersonii, aven1, encodes a putative avenacinase, an enzyme that deglucosylates the anti-fungal saponin, avenacin, rendering it less toxic to the fungus. This gene displays high homology with other fungal saponin-hydrolysing enzymes and beta-glucosidases within GH3. A putative secretory signal peptide of 21 amino acids was identified at the N-terminus of the predicted aven1 protein sequence suggesting that this enzyme is extracellular. Furthermore, T. emersonii cultivated on oat plant biomass was shown to deglucosylate avenacin. The presence of the avenacinase transcript was confirmed by RT-PCR on RNA extracted from mycelia grown in the presence of avenacin. The expression pattern of aven1 on various carbon sources was distinctly different from that of bg1. Only methyl-xylose and gentiobiose induced transcription of aven1. Gentiobiose induces synthesis of a number of cellulase genes by T. emersonii and it may be a possible candidate for the natural cellulase inducer observed in Penicillium purpurogenum. This work represents the first report of an avenacinase gene from a thermophilic, saprophytic fungal source, and suggests that this gene is not exclusive to plant pathogens. 
1339327	19920801	Curr._Genet.	D003160 D016428 	Functional elements of the promoter region of the Aspergillus oryzae glaA gene encoding glucoamylase.	Analysis was made of the promoter region of the Aspergillus oryzae glaA gene encoding glucoamylase. Northern blots using a glucoamylase cDNA as a probe indicated that the amount of mRNA corresponding to the glaA gene increased when expression was induced by starch or maltose. The promoter region of the glaA gene was fused to the Escherichia coli uidA gene, encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS), and the resultant plasmid was introduced into A. oryzae. Expression of GUS protein in the A. oryzae transformants was induced by maltose, indicating that the glaA-GUS gene was regulated at the level of transcription in the presence of maltose. The nucleotide sequence 1.1 kb upstream of the glaA coding region was determined. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the A. oryzae glaA promoter with those of A. oryzae amyB, encoding alpha-amylase, and A. niger glaA showed two regions with similar sequences. Deletion and site-specific mutation analysis of these homologous regions indicated that both are essential for direct high-level expression when grown on maltose.

D016428 D013485 	Gene cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of an alkali-tolerant β-mannanase from Humicola                      insolens Y1.	In this article, we firstly report a highly alkali-tolerant fungal β-mannanase from Humicola insolens Y1. The full-length cDNA of the β-mannanase, designated as man5A, has an open reading frame of 1,233 bp that encodes a 411-amino acid polypeptide (Man5A) with a calculated molecular mass of 42.3 kDa. The deduced sequence of Man5A comprises a putative 20-residue signal peptide and a catalytic domain belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5, and displays 61-85% identities with hypothetical proteins and 32-39% with experimentally verified fungal β-mannanases. Purified recombinant Man5A produced by Pichia pastoris has a specific activity of 1,122 U mg⁻¹ and exhibits optimal activity at pH 5.5 and 70°C. Distinct from other reported fungal β-mannanases, Man5A is highly alkali tolerant, exhibiting 45 and 36% of the maximal activity at pH 8.0 and 9.0, respectively, and more than 10% activity even at pH 10.0. Moreover, Man5A has excellent pH stability at pH 5.0-12.0 and is highly thermostable at 50°C. The higher frequency of alkaline amino acids (Arg and Lys), greater pKa values of the catalytic residues, and more positively charged residues on the surface of Man5A might be the causes. Man5A has strong resistance to various neutral and alkaline proteases, retaining more than 97% of the activity after proteolytic treatment for 1 h. The superior characteristics of Man5A make it more advantageous for the application in the kraft pulp industry. 
19590866	20090711	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Gene cloning and expression of a new acidic family 7 endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from the acidophilic fungus Bispora sp. MEY-1.	Most reported microbial beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 16. Here, we report a new acidic family 7 endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase (Bgl7A) from the acidophilic fungus Bispora sp. MEY-1. The cDNA of Bgl7A was isolated and over-expressed in Pichia pastoris, with a yield of about 1,000 U ml(-1) in a 3.7-l fermentor. The purified recombinant Bgl7A had three activity peaks at pH 1.5, 3.5, and 5.0 (maximum), respectively, and a temperature optimum at 60 degrees C. The enzyme was stable at pH 1.0-8.0 and highly resistant to both pepsin and trypsin. Belonging to the group of non-specific endoglucanase, Bgl7A can hydrolyze not only beta-glucan and cellulose but also laminarin and oat spelt xylan. The specific activity of Bgl7A against barley beta-glucan and lichenan (4,040 and 2,740 U mg(-1)) was higher than toward carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (395 U mg(-1)), which was different from other family 7 endo-beta-glucanases. 
16233124	20051020	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Cloning of a gene encoding a highly stable endo-beta-1,4-glucanase from Aspergillus niger and its expression in yeast.	A gene encoding an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, which is highly resistant to high temperature, protease and surfactant treatment, was isolated from Aspergillus niger IFO31125 and designated as eng1. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by eng1 showed high homology with the sequence of a not-well-characterized cellulase encoded by eglB which has not yet been shown to be a stable enzyme. To confirm the sequence of the gene encoding the highly stable endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, the cloned gene was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which no cellulase activity was found, and the gene product was purified and subjected to enzymatic characterization. The enzyme retained 56% of the initial activity after 1 h of incubation at 80 degrees C and was stable in the range of pH 3.0-10.0. The optimal temperature for enzyme activity was 70 degrees C and the optimal pH was 6.0. The enzyme was highly protease-resistant and retained more than 80% of the initial activity after protease treatment for 3 d at 40 degrees C. The enzyme was also resistant to various surfactants. From these results, eng1 was confirmed to encode a very stable endo-beta-1,4-glucanase. 
15280013	20040729	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 	Tomatidine and lycotetraose, hydrolysis products of alpha-tomatine by Fusarium oxysporum tomatinase, suppress induced defense responses in tomato cells.	Many fungal pathogens of tomato produce extracellular enzymes, collectively known as tomatinases, that detoxify the preformed antifungal steroidal glycoalkaloid alpha-tomatine. Tomatinase from the vascular wilt pathogen of tomato Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici cleaves alpha-tomatine into the aglycon tomatidine (Td) and the tetrasaccharide lycotetraose (Lt). Although modes of action of alpha-tomatine have been extensively studied, those of Td and Lt are poorly understood. Here, we show that both Td and Lt inhibit the oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death in suspension-cultured tomato cells. A tomatinase-negative F. oxysporum strain inherently non-pathogenic on tomato was able to infect tomato cuttings when either Td or Lt was present. These results suggest that tomatinase from F. oxysporum is required not only for detoxification of alpha-tomatine but also for suppression of induced defense responses of host. 
6203744	19840501	EMBO_J.	D016428 	Glucoamylases G1 and G2 from Aspergillus niger are synthesized from two different but closely related mRNAs.	By the use of glucoamylase-specific synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides and molecular cloning of cDNA synthesized from Aspergillus niger total poly(A) + RNA, the primary structure of the glucoamylase G1 mRNA was determined. Glucoamylase G1 is synthesized as a precursor of 640 amino acid residues containing a putative signal peptide of 18 residues, a short propeptide of six residues and the 616 residues long mature enzyme. In vitro translations of mRNA and immunoprecipitations with glucoamylase-specific antisera showed that two glucoamylase polypeptides are synthesized. The larger form with an apparent mol. wt. of 71 000 corresponds to the precursor of glucoamylase G1, and the shorter form with an apparent mol. wt. of 61 000 corresponds to the precursor of glucoamylase G2. From the nucleotide sequencing data of several glucoamylase-specific cDNA recombinants it is shown that the G1 mRNA contains a 169 bp long intervening sequence that can be spliced out to generate a G2 mRNA. Only the 3' part of the G1 mRNA is modified by this splicing event. This kind of differential mRNA processing to give different protein products from one primary transcript has previously only been demonstrated in higher eukaryotes.

Agro-industrial by-products are a potential source of added-value phenolic acids with promising applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Here two purified feruloyl esterases from Aspergillus niger, FAEA and FAEB were tested for their ability to release phenolic acids such as caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid from coffee pulp, apple marc and wheat straw. Their hydrolysis activity was evaluated and compared with their action on maize bran and sugar beet pulp. The specificity of both enzymes against natural and synthetic substrates was evaluated; particular attention was paid to quinic esters and lignin monomers. The efficiency of both enzymes on model substrates was studied. We show the ability of these enzymes to hydrolyze quinic esters and ester linkages between phenolic acids and lignin monomer.

Penicillium purpurogenum produces several enzymes active in xylan hydrolysis, of there, the acetyl xylan esterase (AXE) activity secreted by the fungus has now been studied. The amount of activity obtained in the culture is related to the degree of acetylation of the carbon source used, the best being chemically acetylated xylan. AXE was concentrated from culture supernatants by ultrafiltration and (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and fractionated by gel filtration in Bio-Gel P-300. Two peaks of activity (AXE I and AXE II) were obtained. These two enzymes were further purified separately to homogeneity by chromatography in CM-Sephadex C-50 and chromatofocusing. AXE I (M(r) 48,000) has a pl of 7.5, while AXE II (M(r) 23,000) has a pl of 7.8. Optimal enzyme activity was at pH 5.3 and 50 degrees C for AXE I and pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C for AXE II. Both enzymes are active towards several acetylated substrates. Antisera against the two enzymes do not cross-react, and the N-terminal sequences of AXE I and II do not show similarities. These results suggest that AXE I and AXE II are the products of different genes. 
2125957	19900901	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Two glycosylation patterns for a single protein (exoglucanase) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Exoglucanases (beta-glucosidases) I and II secreted into the culture medium by Saccharomyces cerevisiae were purified from cell cultures harvested at the early exponential phase of growth in order to avoid contamination of the second by a new immunologically-related material. The amino acid composition of the purified enzymes was roughly the same. In addition, both exoglucanases exhibited an identical NH2-terminal sequence (50 residues). These results confirm our previous results about the identity of the protein moieties of both enzymes. Exoglucanase I appears to arise by elongation of one or both short oligosaccharides present in enzyme II. 
16278932	20051110	Yeast	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of a dextranase gene from Lipomyces starkeyi and its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	A dextranase-encoding cDNA from L. starkeyi KSM22 was isolated and characterized. The 2052 bp cDNA fragment (lsd1) harbouring the dextranase gene exhibited one open reading frame (ORF) composed of 1824 bp flanked by a 41 bp 5'-UTR and a 184 bp 3'-UTR, including a 27 bp poly(A) tail. The lsd1 gene contains no introns. The open reading frame encodes a 608 amino acid polypeptide (LSD1) with a 67.6 kDa predicted molecular mass. There was a 77% deduced amino acid sequence identity between the LSD1 dextranase and the dextranase from Penicillium minioluteum. The primary structure of LSD1 dextranase exhibits distant similarity with the enzymes of the glycosyl hydrolase family 49 that comprises Penicillium dextranase. The optimum pH of LSD1 was 6.0 and the optimum temperature was 37 degrees C. LSD1 dextranase activity was substantially abolished by exposure to 1 mM Hg2+, Ag3+ and Mn2+. LSD1 exhibited high hydrolysing activity towards dextran (100%), soluble starch (22%) and mutan (8%).

D016428 	Comparison of endo-polygalacturonase activities of citrus and non-citrus races of Geotrichum candidum, and cloning and expression of the corresponding genes.	summary Geotrichum candidum citrus race, a fungus that causes a sour rot disease in citrus fruits, secretes an endo-polygalacturonase (PG) that may facilitate the disease. There also exists a non-citrus race that is non-pathogenic to citrus fruits. In this research, we found that the PG activity of the citrus race isolates was much higher than that of the non-citrus race isolates in culture medium and inoculated lemon peel, and that there was a significant correlation between the PG activity and pathogenicity. We isolated the two corresponding PG genes, S31pg1 and S63pg1, from citrus race S31 and non-citrus race S63, respectively. S31PG1 and S63PG1 consisted of 368 and 369 amino acids, respectively. The two PG genes showed 68% identity at the amino acid level. In expression studies, S31pg1 transcript was detected in mycelia grown in liquid cultures of citrus race S31 containing either glucose, pectin or lemon peel broth. The transcript was also detected in lemon peel inoculated with the isolate. On the other hand, no transcript of S63pg1 was detected in mycelia grown on any liquid cultures of non-citrus race S63 and lemon peel inoculated with the isolate. These results indicate that PG may play an important role in the development of the sour rot symptom and be involved in the difference of pathogenicity between the two races. 
1970434	19900101	Protein_Eng.	D016428 D013485 	Catalytic mechanism of fungal glucoamylase as defined by mutagenesis of Asp176, Glu179 and Glu180 in the enzyme from Aspergillus awamori.	Asp176, Glu179 and Glu180 of Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase appeared by differential labeling to be in the active site. To test their functions, they were replaced by mutagenesis with Asn, Gln and Gln respectively, and kinetic parameters and pH dependencies of all enzyme forms were determined. Glu179----Gln glucoamylase was not active on maltose or isomaltose, while the kcat for maltoheptaose hydrolysis decreased almost 2000-fold and the KM was essentially unchanged from wild-type glucoamylase. The The Glu180----Gln mutation drastically increased the KM and moderately decreased the kcat with maltose and maltoheptaose, but affected isomaltose hydrolysis less. Difference in substrate activation energies between Glu180----Gln and wild-type glucoamylases indicate that Glu180 binds D-glucosyl residues in subsite 2. The Asp176----Asn substitution gave moderate increases and decreases in KM and kcat respectively, and therefore similar increases in activation energies for the three substrates. This and the differences in subsite binding energies between Asp176----Asn and wild-type glucoamylases suggest that Asp176 is near subsite 1, where it stabilizes the transition state and interacts with Trp120 at subsite 4. Glu179 and Asp176 are thus proposed as the general catalytic acid and base of pKa 5.9 and 2.7 respectively. The charged Glu180 contributes to the high pKa value of Glu179. 
11298744	20010412	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 	Carboxyl group of residue Asp647 as possible proton donor in catalytic reaction of alpha-glucosidase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe.	cDNA encoding Schizosaccharomyces pombe alpha-glucosidase was cloned from a library constructed from mRNA of the fission yeast, and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cDNA, 4176 bp in length, included a single ORF composed of 2910 bp encoding a polypeptide of 969 amino-acid residues with M(r) 106 138. The deduced amino-acid sequence showed a high homology to those of alpha-glucosidases from molds, plants and mammals. Therefore, the enzyme was categorized into the alpha-glucosidase family II. By site-directed mutagenesis, Asp481, Glu484 and Asp647 residues were confirmed to be essential in the catalytic reaction. The carboxyl group (-COOH) of the Asp647 residue was for the first time shown to be the most likely proton donor acting as the acid catalyst in the alpha-glucosidase of family II. Studies with the chemical modifier conduritol B epoxide suggested that the carboxylate group (-COO-) of the Asp481 residue was the catalytic nucleophile, although the role of the Glu484 residue remains obscure. 
24096679	20131008	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Characterization of a glycoside hydrolase family 31 α-glucosidase involved in starch utilization in Podospora anserina.	For Podospora anserina, several studies of cellulolytic enzymes have been established, but characteristics of amylolytic enzymes are not well understood. When P. anserina grew in starch as carbon source, it accumulated glucose, nigerose, and maltose in the culture supernatant. At the same time, the fungus secreted α-glucosidase (PAG). PAG was purified from the culture supernatant, and was found to convert soluble starch to nigerose and maltose. The recombinant enzyme with C-terminal His-tag (rPAG) was produced with Pichia pastoris. Most rPAG produced under standard conditions lost its affinity for nickel-chelating resin, but the affinity was improved by the use of a buffered medium (pH 8.0) supplemented with casamino acid and a reduction of the cultivation time. rPAG suffered limited proteolysis at the same site as the original PAG. A site-directed mutagenesis study indicated that proteolysis had no effect on enzyme characteristics. A kinetic study indicated that the PAG possessed significant transglycosylation activity.  
15043869	20040327	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of Lipomyces starkeyi alpha-amylase in Escherichia coli and determination of some of its properties.	The Lipomyces starkeyi alpha-amylase (LSA) gene encoding soluble starch-degrading alpha-amylase was cloned and characterized from a derepressed and partially constitutive mutant for both dextranase and amylase activities. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cDNA fragment reveals an open reading frame of 1944 bp encoding a 619 amino acid (aa) mature protein (LSA) with a calculated molecular weight of 68.709 kDa that was estimated to be about 73 kDa, including His tag (4 kDa) based on SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel), activity staining, and the Western blotting, using anti-amylase-Ab. LSA had a sequence similar to other alpha-amylases in four conserved regions of the alpha-amylase family: (I) (287)DIVVNH(292), (II) (372)GLRIDTVKH(380), (III) (399)GEVFD(403), (IV) (462)FLENQD(467). Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis showed one intron of 60 nucleotides in the genomic lsa at positions between 966 and 967 of cDNA. The cloned LSA amylase showed a maximum activity at pH 6 and optimum temperature of 40 (o)C, with greater than 90% stability between pH 5 and pH 8 for 16 h. It was inhibited by Cu(2+) and stimulated by Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). Enzyme activity was not affected by 1 mM EGTA but was inhibited by 1 mM EDTA. LSA did not hydrolyze maltodextrins of G2 to G4, yet formed G2+G3 from G5, G2+G4 or G3+G3 from G6, and G3+G4 from G7. LSA did not hydrolyze soluble starch in the present of 2% (w/v) of acarbose. Kinetics of LSA was carried out by using starch as a substrate and the inhibition type of acarbose was the mixed non-competitive type (ki = 3.4 microM). 
12922166	20030819	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 	Biochemical characterization of Aspergillus awamori exoinulinase: substrate binding characteristics and regioselectivity of hydrolysis.	1H-NMR analysis was applied to investigate the hydrolytic activity of Aspergillus awamori inulinase. The obtained NMR signals and deduced metabolite pattern revealed that the enzyme cleaves off only fructose from inulin and does not possess transglycosylating activity. Kinetics for the enzyme hydrolysis of inulooligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization (d.p.) were recorded. The enzyme hydrolyzed both beta2,1- as well as beta2,6-fructosyl linkages in fructooligosaccharides. From the k(cat)/K(m) ratios obtained with inulooligosaccharides with d.p. from 2 to 7, we deduce that the catalytic site of the inulinase contains at least five fructosyl-binding sites and can be classified as exo-acting enzyme. Product analysis of inulopentaose and inulohexaose hydrolysis by the Aspergillus inulinase provided no evidence for a possible multiple-attack mode of action, suggesting that the enzyme acts exclusively as an exoinulinase. 
15294290	20040806	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Homologous expression of the feruloyl esterase B gene from Aspergillus niger and characterization of the recombinant enzyme.	The faeB gene encoding the feruloyl esterase B (FAEB) was isolated from Aspergillus niger BRFM131 genomic DNA. The faeB gene, with additional sequence coding for a C-terminal histidine tag, was inserted into an expression vector under the control of the gpd promoter and trpC terminator and expressed in a protease deficient A. niger strain. Homologous overproduction allows to reach an esterase activity of 18 nkat mL(-1) against MCA as substrate. The improvement factor was 16-fold higher as compared to the production level obtained with non-transformed A. niger strain induced by sugar beet pulp. The corresponding secretion yield was estimated to be around 100 mg L(-1). Recombinant FAEB was purified 14.6-fold to homogeneity from an 8-day-old culture by a single affinity chromatographic step with a recovery of 64%. SDS-PAGE revealed a single band with a molecular mass of 75 kDa, while under non-denatured conditions, native enzyme has a molecular mass of around 150 kDa confirming that the recombinant FAEB is a homodimer. The recombinant and native FAEB have the same characteristics concerning temperature and pH optima, i.e., 50 degrees C and 6, respectively. In addition, the recombinant FAEB was determined to be quite stable up to 50 degrees C for 120 min. Kinetic constants for MCA, MpCA, and chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoyl quinic acid) were as follows: Km: 0.13, 0.029, and 0.16 mM and Vmax: 1101, 527.6, and 28.3 nkat mg(-1), respectively. This is the first report on the homologous overproduction of feruloyl esterase B in A. niger. 
8945534	19961201	Infect._Immun.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of the complement fixation antigen-chitinase of Coccidioides immitis.	A chitinase had been isolated from the culture filtrates of Coccidioides immitis endosporulating spherules and from hyphae and shown to be the coccidioidal complement fixation (CF) and immunodiffusion-CF antigen. In the present study, we made use of our previously determined amino-terminal (N-terminal) sequence of the CF-chitinase to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers and to amplify and sequence a PCR product that coded for the N-terminal portion of the CF-chitinase. The PCR product was used as a hybridization probe to screen a developing spherule-(lambda)ZAP cDNA library, and three hybridizing clones were selected. These clones were converted into their pBluescript expression plasmid form in Escherichia coli and induced to express their recombinant proteins. Lysate from only one clone, pCTS 4-2A, yielded an enzymatically functional CF-chitinase and a line of identity with control immunodiffusion-CF-positive antigen. The pCTS 4-2A insert was sequenced and found to contain a deduced open reading frame coding for a 427-amino-acid polypeptide with an approximate molecular weight of 47 kDa. When purified by a chitin adsorption-desorption method, the recombinant protein exhibited virtually identical characteristics to those of the original C. immitis CF-chitinase. Nondenaturing gels of the pCTS 4-2A E. coli lysates and the purified C. immitis and recombinant CF-chitinase revealed proteins that had chitinase activity and similar relative electrophoretic mobilities. The appearance and relative levels of hybridizing RNA from the developing spherules-endospores (SEs) and hyphae correlated with the appearance or presence and level of CF-chitinase enzyme activity found in SEs culture filtrate and in cellular extracts of developing SE and hyphae. Thus, a functional recombinant CF-chitinase antigen was produced in E. coli and was used in serological diagnostic applications. These results also suggest a functional role for this chitinase in SE development and maturation. 
3146949	19881201	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Nucleotide sequences of Saccharomycopsis fibuligera genes for extracellular beta-glucosidases as expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	We isolated two genes for extracellular beta-glucosidase, BGL1 and BGL2, from the genomic library of the yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera. Gene products (BGLI and BGLII) were purified from the culture fluids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformed with BGL1 and BGL2, respectively. Molecular weights of BGLI and BGLII were estimated to be 220,000 and 200,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The two beta-glucosidases showed the same enzymatic characteristics, such as thermo-denaturation kinetics and dependencies on pH and temperature, but quite different substrate specificities: BGLI hydrolyzed cellobiose efficiently, but BGLII did not. This result is consistent with the observation that the S. cerevisiae transformant carrying BGL1 fermented cellobiose to ethanol but the transformant carrying BGL2 did not. Southern blot analysis revealed that the two beta-glucosidase genes were derived from Saccharomycopsis fibuligera and that the nucleotide sequences of the two genes are closely related. The complete nucleotide sequences of the two genes were determined. BGL1 and BGL2 encode 876- and 880-amino-acid proteins which were shown to be highly similar to each other. The putative precursors begin with hydrophobic segments that presumably act as signal sequences for secretion. Amino acid analysis of the purified proteins confirmed that BGL1 and BGL2 encode BGLI and BGLII, respectively. 
18045411	20071130	J._Appl._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning of a gene encoding thermostable glucoamylase from Chaetomium thermophilum and its expression in Pichia pastoris.	Chaetomium thermophilum is a soil-borne thermophilic fungus whose molecular biology is poorly understood. Only a few genes have been cloned from the Chaetomium genus. This study attempted to clone, to sequence and to express a thermostable glucoamylase gene of C. thermophilum. First strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA isolated from C. thermophilum and the glucoamylase gene amplified by using PCR. Degenerate primers based on the N-terminal sequences of the purified glucoamylase according to our previous works and a cDNA fragment encoding the glucoamylase gene was obtained through RT-PCR. Using RACE-PCR, full-length cDNA of glucoamylase gene was cloned from C. thermophilum. The full-length cDNA of the glucoamylase was 2016 bp and contained a 1797-bp open reading frame encoding a protein glucoamylase precursor of 599 amino acid residues. The amino-acid sequence from 31 to 45 corresponded to the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein. The first 30 amino acids were presumed to be a signal peptide. The alignment results of the putative amino acid sequence showed the catalytic domain of the glucoamylase was high homology with the catalytic domains of the other glucoamylases. The C. thermophilum glucoamylase gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the glucoamylase was secreted into the culture medium by the yeast in a functionally active form. The recombinant glucoamylase purified was a glycoprotein with a size of about 66 kDa, and exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 4.5-5.0 and 65 degrees C. The enzyme was stable at 60 degrees C, the enzyme activity kept 80% after 60 min incubation at 70 degrees C. The half-life was 40 and 10 min under incubation at 80 and 90 degrees C respectively. A new thermostable glucoamylase gene of C. thermophilum was cloned, sequenced, overexpressed successfully in P. pastoris. Because of its thermostability and overexpression, this glucoamylase enzyme offers an interesting potential in saccharification steps in both starch enzymatic conversion and in alcohol production. 
8575023	19951001	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Primary structure and expression pattern of the 33-kDa chitinase gene from the mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma harzianum.	A gene (chit33) from the mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma harzianum, coding for a chitinase of 33 kDa, has been isolated and characterized. Partial amino-acid sequences from the purified 33-kDa chitinase were obtained. The amino-terminal peptide sequence was employed to design an oligonucleotide probe and was used as a primer to isolate a 1.2-kb cDNA. The cDNA codes for a protein of 321 amino acids, which includes a putative signal peptide of 19 amino acids. All microsequenced peptides found in this sequence, indicate that this cDNA codes for the 33-kDa chitinase. A high homology (approximately 43% identity) was found with fungal and plant chitinases, including yeast chitinases. However enzyme characteristics suggest a nutritional (saprophytic or mycoparasitic), rather than a morphogenetic, role for this chitinase. The chit33 gene appears as a single copy in the T. harzianum genome, is strongly suppressed by glucose, and de-repressed under starvation conditions as well as in the presence of autoclaved mycelia and/or fungal cell walls. The 33-kDa chitinase seems to be very stable except under starvation conditions. The independent regulation of each of the chitinases in T. harzianum indicates different specific roles. 
10101286	19990402	J._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 	Molecular cloning and expression of the novel fungal beta-glucosidase genes from Humicola grisea and Trichoderma reesei.	A novel fungal beta-glucosidase gene (bgl4) and its homologue (bgl2) were cloned from the cellulolytic fungi Humicola grisea and Trichoderma reesei, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of H. grisea BGL4 and T. reesei BGL2 comprise 476 and 466 amino acids, respectively, and share 73.1% identity. These beta-glucosidases show significant homology to plant beta-glucosidases belonging to the beta-glucosidase A (BGA) family. Both genes were expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, and the recombinant beta-glucosidases were purified. Recombinant H. grisea BGL4 is a thermostable enzyme compared with recombinant T. reesei BGL2. In addition to beta-glucosidase activity, recombinant H. grisea BGL4 showed a significant level of beta-galactosidase activity, while recombinant T. reesei BGL2 showed weak beta-galactosidase activity. Cellulose saccharification by Trichoderma cellulases was improved by the addition of recombinant H. grisea BGL4. 
18675351	20080805	Mycol._Res.	D016428 D013485 	An N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase gene, cr-nag1, from the biocontrol agent Clonostachys rosea is up-regulated in antagonistic interactions with Fusarium culmorum.	Clonostachys rosea is a widely distributed fungus that often acts as a parasite on other soil fungi. This fungus has also been reported as a potential parasite against nematodes and insects. The antagonistic activity is thought to be correlated with the secretion of cell wall-degrading enzymes, including chitinases. In this work, we identified and characterized an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase-encoding gene, cr-nag1, belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 20, from the C. rosea strain IK726 using a degenerated primer strategy designed from conserved motifs. The complete gene, including its promoter region, was obtained by genomic walking. Southern analysis showed that cr-nag1 is present as a single copy gene in C. rosea. Phylogenetically, cr-nag1 showed the highest similarity to N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase genes from other mycoparasitic fungi. Enzymatic assays and RT-PCR showed that the NAGase activity of C. rosea is specifically repressed in medium containing a high glucose content and is expressed in media containing chitin or Fusarium culmorum cell walls as sole carbon sources. Macroscopic and microscopic observations indicated that the mycelial growth of F. culmorum and Pythium ultimum were inhibited during interactions with C. rosea. High expression of cr-nag1 was found in interactions between C. rosea and F. culmorum, whereas the expression of cr-nag1 in interactions between C. rosea and P. ultimum was similar to the control. This indicates that although C. rosea secretes chitin-hydrolysing agents in order to target the cell wall of F. culmorum, it seems to use another strategy for controlling the development of the oomycete P. ultimum. 
16427312	20060124	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013486 	An extracellular exo-beta-(1,3)-glucanase from Pichia pastoris: purification, characterization, molecular cloning, and functional expression.	An extracellular exo-beta-(1,3)-glucanase (designated EXG1) was purified to apparent homogeneity from Pichia pastoris X-33 cultures by ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The native enzyme is unglycosylated and monomeric with a molecular mass of approximately 47kDa. At its optimal pH of 6.0, the enzyme shows highest activity among physiological substrates toward laminarin (apparent Km, 3.5 mg/ml; Vmax, 192 micromole glucose produced/min/mg protein) but also hydrolyzes amygdalin and esculin, and the chromogenic substrates p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside. The P. pastoris EXG1 gene was cloned by a PCR-based strategy using genomic DNA as template. This intronless gene predicts an ORF that encodes a primary translation product of 414 amino acids. We believe that this preproprotein is processed sequentially by signal peptidase and a Kex2-like endoprotease to yield a mature protein of 392 amino acids (45,376 Da; pI, 4.46) that shares 36-64% amino acid identity with other yeast exo-beta-(1,3)-glucanases belonging to Glycoside Hydrolase Family 5. It also possesses the eight invariant residues and signature pattern [LIV]-[LIVMFYWGA](2)-[DNEQG]-[LIVMGST]-X-N-E-[PV]-[RHDNSTLIVFY] shown by all Family 5 members. Overexpression of the cloned EXG1 gene in Pichia cells, followed by Ni-CAM HC resin chromatography, yielded milligram quantities of homogeneous recombinant EXG1 in active form for further characterization studies.

Two endo-1,4-beta-glucanase genes, designated celA and celB, from a shoyu koji mold Aspergillus oryzae KBN616, were cloned and characterized. The celA gene comprised 877 bp with two introns. The CelA protein consisted of 239 amino acids and was assigned to the cellulase family H. The celB gene comprised 1248 bp with no introns. The CelB protein consisted of 416 amino acids and was assigned to the cellulase family C. Both genes were overexpressed under the promoter of the A. oryzae taka-amylase A gene for purification and enzymatic characterization of CelA and CelB. CelA had a molecular mass of 31 kDa, a pH optimum of 5.0 and temperature optimum of 55 degrees C, whereas CelB had a molecular mass of 53 kDa, a pH optimum of 4.0 and temperature optimum of 45 degrees C. 
6204865	19840701	EMBO_J.	D016428 	Two different types of intervening sequences in the glucoamylase gene from Aspergillus niger.	One single glucoamylase gene could be identified in the chromosomal DNA of Aspergillus niger by Southern blot analysis. This glucoamylase gene was isolated from a genomic library of A. niger DNA. The glucoamylase gene is situated on a 2.5-kb EcoRI-EcoRV fragment and contains five intervening sequences in the coding region. One 169-bp intron is involved in differential mRNA processing leading to the two different glucoamylase enzymes G1 and G2; the other four introns are all very small ranging from 55 to 75 bp in length. One intron has a significant homology to the coding region which immediately follows, and it contains the internal conserved sequence TACTAAC, which is also found in yeast chromosomal gene introns, and is thought to participate in mRNA splicing. Two transcription initiation sites and a typical eukaryotic promoter region with TATAAT and CAAT boxes are located upstream from the gene.

A thermostable beta-glucosidase (BGLI) was purified from Thermoascus aurantiacus IFO9748, and the gene (bgl1) encoding this enzyme was cloned and expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by bgl1 showed high similarity with the sequence of glycoside hydrolase family 3. The recombinant enzyme was purified and subjected to enzymatic characterization. Recombinant BGLI retained more than 70% of its initial activity after 1 h of incubation at 60 degrees C and was stable in the pH range 3-8. The optimal temperature for enzyme activity was about 70 degrees C and the optimal pH was about 5. P. pastoris expressing recombinant BGLI became able to utilize cellobiose as a carbon source.

A novel β-glucosidase gene (PtBglu1) from the thermophilic fungus, Paecilomyces thermophila, was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. PtBglu1 contained an open reading frame of 1440-bp nucleotides and encoded a protein of 479 amino acids which showed significant similarity to other fungal β-glucosidases from glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 1. The recombinant β-glucosidase (PtBglu1) was secreted at high level of 190.2 U mL(-1) in high cell density fermentor (5L). PtBglu1 was purified to homogeneity, and was found to be a glycoprotein with molecular mass of 56.7 kDa. The purified PtBglu1 showed optimum catalytic activity at pH 6.0 and 55 °C. The enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificity with highest activity toward pNP-β-D-glucopyranoside, followed by pNP-β-D-galactopyranoside and cellobiose. The K(m) values for pNP-β-D-glucopyranoside, cellobiose, gentiobiose and salicin were 0.55 mM, 1.0 mM, 1.74 mM and 6.85 mM, respectively. These properties make PtBglu1 a potential candidate for various industrial applications. 
6765603	19810501	Mol._Cell._Biol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487 	Temperature-sensitive forms of large and small invertase in a mutant derived from a SUC1 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Mutagenesis of the sucrose-fermenting (SUC1) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 4059-358D yielded an invertase-negative mutant (D10). Subsequent mutagenic treatment of D10 gave a sucrose-fermenting revertant (D10-ER1) that contained the same amount of large (mannoprotein) invertase as strain 4059-358D but only trace amounts of the smaller intracellular nonglycosylated enzyme. Limited genetic evidence indicated that the mutations in D10 and D10-ER1 are allelic to the SUC1 gene. The large invertases from D10-ER1 and 4059-358D were purified and compared. The two enzymes have similar specific activity and Km for sucrose, cross-react immunologically, and show the same subunit molecular weight after removal of the carbohydrate with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidae H. They differ in that the large enzyme from the revertant is rapidly inactivated at 55 degrees C, whereas that from the parent is relatively stable at 65 degrees C. The small invertase in extracts of D10-ER1 is also heat sensitive as compared to the small enzyme from the original parent strain. The low level of small invertase in mutant D10-ER1 may reflect increased intracellular degradation of this heat-labile form. In several crosses of D10-ER1 with strains carrying the SUC1 or SUC3 genes, the temperature sensitivity of the large and small invertases and the low cellular level of small invertase appeared to cosegregate. These findings are evidence that SUC1 is a structural gene for invertase and that both large and small forms are encoded by a single gene. A detailed genetic analysis is presented in a companion paper.

An exo-beta-(1----3)-D-galactanase from Driselase, a commercial enzyme preparation from Irpex lacteus (Polyporus tulipiferae) has been purified 166-fold. Apparent molecular weights of the purified enzyme, estimated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, were found to be 51,000 and 42,000, respectively. It hydrolyzed specifically oligosaccharides and polymers of (1----3)-linked beta-D-galactopyranosyl residues, and exhibited a maximal activity toward these substrates at pH 4.6. Based on the mode of the liberation of D-galactose from beta-(1----3)-D-galactan and the methyl beta-glycoside of beta-(1----3)-D-galactopentaose, the enzyme can be classified as an exo-glycanase capable of catalyzing the sequential hydrolytic release of single D-galactosyl residues from the nonreducing termini. The extent of the hydrolysis of the carbohydrate portion of acacia gum and radish arabinogalactan-proteins increased with their decreasing branching. Isolation and characterization of the major products formed from the proteoglycans indicated the action pattern of the enzyme to include the capability of bypassing the branching points. Consequently, the side chains carrying an additional D-galactosyl group at the reducing termini are released as neutral (1----6)-linked beta-D-galactooligosaccharides and their acidic derivatives having a 4-O-methyl-beta-D-glucuronosyl residue as the nonreducing end-group. The specificity and the mode of action showed the enzyme to be a useful tool for analyzing the fine structure of type II arabinogalactans and arabinogalactan-protein conjugates. 
2509432	19891101	J._Bacteriol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning of a cell wall exo-beta-1,3-glucanase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	A major protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell walls is a 29-kilodalton glycoprotein which shows lectinlike binding to beta-1,3-glucan and chitin. It was solubilized by heating isolated cell walls at 90 degrees C and purified to homogeneity by running two high-pressure liquid chromatography columns. With the sequence information of the N terminus and seven peptides, two oligonucleotides were synthesized and the gene was cloned. Its sequence is similar to those of two plant beta-glucanases, and the protein was shown to possess beta-1,3-exoglucanase activity with laminarin as substrate. Haploid yeast cells contained one copy of the gene (BGL2). Gene disruption did not result in a phenotype. 
19129654	20090109	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and transcript analysis of multiple genes encoding the glycoside hydrolase family 6 enzyme from Coprinopsis cinerea.	We searched the genome database of the basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea (Coprinus cinereus) and found five genes encoding the glycoside hydrolase family 6 (GH6) enzyme, CcCel6A, CcCel6B, CcCel6C, CcCel6D, and CcCel6E, designated in order of increasing locus number (CC1G_01107.1, CC1G_04166.1, CC1G_08276.1, CC1G_08277.1, and CC1G_10605.1). The amino acid sequence of CcCel6A suggests a two-domain structure consisting of an N-terminal family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1) and a GH6 catalytic domain, while the other genes lack CBM1. The transcripts of CcCel6A were observed at the active growth stage in cellulose culture, whereas they were absent from glucose culture. Cellobiose strongly induced transcription of CcCel6A. On the other hand, transcripts of CcCel6B, -D, and -E were detected in both glucose and cellulose cultures, and transcription of them was induced weakly by cellobiose. The transcript level of CcCel6C was not influenced by glucose or cellobiose. 
12664153	20030329	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D003160 D016428 	Comparison of modular and non-modular xylanases as carrier proteins for the efficient secretion of heterologous proteins from Penicillium funiculosum.	Genes encoding three enzymes with xylanase activity from the filamentous fungus Penicillium funiculosum are described. Two of the encoded xylanases are predicted to be modular in structure with catalytic and substrate-binding domains separated by a serine and threonine-rich linker region; the other had none of these properties and was non-modular. In order to develop P. funiculosum as a host for the secreted production of heterologous proteins, each of the xylanases was assessed for use as a carrier protein in a fusion strategy. We show that one of the modular xylanases (encoded by xynA) was an effective carrier protein but the other (encoded by xynB) and the non-modular xylanase (encoded by xynC) were not effective as secretion carriers. We show that the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) protein from Escherichia coli is secreted by P. funiculosum when expressed as an XYNA fusion but that the secreted GUS protein, cleaved in vivo from XYNA, is glycosylated and enzymatically inactive. 
21243443	20110119	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Gene cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization of a high maltose-producing α-amylase of Rhizopus oryzae.	A putative α-amylase gene, designated as RoAmy, was cloned from Rhizopus oryzae. The deduced amino acid sequence showed the highest (42.8%) similarity to the α-amylase from Trichoderma viride. The RoAmy gene was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 under the induction of methanol. The molecular weight of the purified RoAmy determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was approximately 48 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature were 4-6 and 60 °C, respectively. The enzyme was stable at pH ranges of 4.5-6.5 and temperatures below 50 °C. Purified RoAmy had a K(m) and V(max) of 0.27 mg/ml and 0.068 mg/min, respectively, with a specific activity of 1,123 U/mg on soluble starch. Amylase activity was strongly inhibited by 5 mM Cu(2+) and 5 mM Fe(2+), whereas 5 mM Ca(2+) showed no significant effect. The RoAmy hydrolytic activity was the highest on wheat starch but showed only 55% activity on amylopectin relative to soluble corn starch, while the pullulanase activity was negligible. The main end products of the polysaccharides tested were glucose and maltose. Maltose reached a concentration of 74% (w/w) with potato starch as the substrate. The enzyme had an extremely high affinity (K(m) = 0.22 mM) to maltotriose. A high ratio of glucose/maltose of 1:4 was obtained when maltotriose was used at an initial concentration of 40 mM. 
22584433	20120516	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Biochemical characterization of a GH53 endo-β-1,4-galactanase and a GH35 exo-β-1,4-galactanase from Penicillium chrysogenum.	An endo-β-1,4-galactanase (PcGAL1) and an exo-β-1,4-galactanase (PcGALX35C) were purified from the culture filtrate of Penicillium chrysogenum 31B. Pcgal1 and Pcgalx35C cDNAs encoding PcGAL1 and PcGALX35C were isolated by in vitro cloning. The deduced amino acid sequences of PcGAL1 and PcGALX35C are highly similar to a putative endo-β-1,4-galactanase of Aspergillus terreus (70% amino acid identity) and a putative β-galactosidase of Neosartorya fischeri (72%), respectively. Pfam analysis revealed a "Glyco_hydro_53" domain in PcGAL1. PcGALX35C is composed of five distinct domains including "Glyco_hydro_35," "BetaGal_dom2," "BetaGal_dom3," and two "BetaGal_dom4_5" domains. Recombinant enzymes (rPcGAL1 and rPcGALX35C) expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, respectively, were active against lupin galactan. The reaction products of lupin galactan revealed that rPcGAL1 cleaved the substrate in an endo manner. The enzyme accumulated galactose and galactobiose as the main products. The smallest substrate for rPcGAL1 was β-1,4-galactotriose. On the other hand, rPcGALX35C released only galactose from lupin galactan throughout the reaction, indicating that it is an exo-β-1,4-galactanase. rPcGALX35C was active on both β-1,4-galactobiose and triose, but not on lactose, β-1,3- or β-1,6-galactooligosaccharides even after 24 h of incubation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a gene encoding a microbial exo-β-1,4-galactanase. rPcGAL1 and rPcGALX35C acted synergistically in the degradation of lupin galactan and soybean arabinogalactan. Lupin galactan was almost completely degraded to galactose by the combined actions of rPcGAL1 and rPcGALX35C. Surprisingly, neither rPcGAL1 nor rPcGALX35C released any galactose from sugar beet pectin.
