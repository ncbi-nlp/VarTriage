D016428 D013485 	Suppression of Fusarium oxysporum and induced resistance of plants involved in the biocontrol of Cucumber Fusarium Wilt by Streptomyces bikiniensis HD-087.	Cucumber Fusarium Wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum, which usually leads to severe economic damage, is a common destructive disease worldwide. To date, no effective method has yet been found to counteract this disease. A fungal isolate, designated HD-087, which was identified as Streptomyces bikiniensis using physiological-biochemical identification and 16S rRNA sequence analysis, is shown to possess distinctive inhibitory activity against F. oxysporum. The fermentation broth of HD-087 leads to certain abnormalities in pathogen hyphae. It peroxidizes cell membrane lipids, which leads to membrane destruction along with cytoplasm leakage. This broth also restrains germination of the conidia. The activities of the enzymes peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and β-1,3-glucanase in cucumber leaves were dramatically increased after treated with fermentation broth of HD-087. The levels of chlorophyll and soluble sugars were also found to be increased, with the relative conductivity of leaves being reduced. In short, the metabolites of strain HD-087 can effectively suppress F. oxysporum and trigger induced resistance in cucumber. 
24307047	20131206	J._Chem._Ecol.	D016428 	Cellulose digestion inMonochamus marmorator Kby. (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae): Role of acquired fungal enzymes.	Larvae of the balsam fir sawyer,Monochamus marmorator Kby. (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae), contain midgut digestive enzymes active against hemicellulose and cellulose. Cellulases from larvae fed on balsam fir wood infected with the fungus,Trichoderma harzianum Rifai (Deuteromycetes, Moniliales, Moniliaceae), were found to be identical to those of the cellulase complex produced by this fungus when compared using chromatography, electrophoresis, and isofocusing. When larvae are maintained on a fungus-free diet, their midgut fluids lack cellulolytic activity, and they are unable to digest cellulose. Cellulolytic capacity can be restored by feeding the larvae wood permeated by fungi. We conclude that the enzymes which enableM. marmorator larvae to digest cellulose are not produced by the larvae. Instead, the larvae acquire the capacity to digest cellulose by ingesting active fungal cellulases while feeding in fungus-infected wood.

D016428 	Acquired Resistance in Barley (The Resistance Mechanism Induced by 2,6-Dichloroisonicotinic Acid Is a Phenocopy of a Genetically Based Mechanism Governing Race-Specific Powdery Mildew Resistance).	Treatment of susceptible barley (Hordeum vulgare) seedlings with 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (DCINA) induces disease resistance against the powdery mildew fungus (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei). A cytological analysis of the interaction reveals the hypersensitive cell collapse in attacked, short epidermal cells, along with the accumulation of fluorescent material in papillae, that appear at the time of fungal arrest. The cell-type-specific hypersensitive reaction occurs prior to formation of haustoria, reminiscent of the mechanism identified in genetically resistant barley plants containing the functionally active Mlg gene (R. Gorg, K. Hollricher, P. Schulze-Lefert [1993] Plant J 3: 857-866). This observation indicates that the mechanism of DCINA-induced resistance is a phenocopy of the mechanism governed by the Mlg locus. The onset of acquired resistance correlates with high-level transcript accumulation of barley defense-related genes encoding pathogenesis-related protein-1, peroxidase, and chitinase but not [beta]-1,3-glucanase. Subcellular localization of peroxidase activity shows an increase in enzyme activity in the epidermal cell layer and in the intercellular fluids of barley leaves. Four out of more than 10 identified extracellular isozymes are induced by DCINA. The epidermal cell layer contains a major constitutively formed isozyme, together with two isozymes specifically induced by DCINA. The data support the hypothesis that host cell death and high-level accumulation of defense-related gene transcripts are not only commonly controlled in certain types of race-specific resistance (A. Freialdenhoven, B. Scherag, K. Hollricher, D.B. Collinge, H. Thordal-Christensen, P. Schulze-Lefert [1994] Plant Cell 6: 983-994) but also in acquired resistance, which confers protection to a broad spectrum of different pathogens.

A scheme of isolation and purification of the enzyme with alpha-L-rhamnosidase activity has been developed. It included fractionation by ammonium sulfate and chromatography on TSK-gels Toyopearl HW-60, Fractogel TSK DEAE-650-s and Sepharose 6B. The enzyme was purified 60 times with the yield of 0.5%. The enzyme preparation did not contain any glycosidase and proteolytic activity. Molecular mass of the alpha-L-rhamnosidase enzyme on the data of Sepharose 6B gel-filtration was 35 kDa. The enzyme preparation was stable during 48 hours at 20 degrees C, its pH- and thermal optimum were 5 and 60 degrees C, correspondingly.

To study the conditions on separation and regeneration of protoplast from Phellinus igniarius. The effects of enzymolysis conditions of P. igniarius mycelia on yield of protoplast and culturing conditons on regeneration ratio of protoplast were investigated. When the 8 days-old mycelia was hydrolysed by 1.5% of lywallzyme adding to driselase of 0. 5% and at 30 degrees C for 3 h and enzymolysis was stablized by sucrose as a stablisher of osmotic pressure, higher yield of P. igniarius protoplast was obtained. If 10 days-old mycelia was used as raw material of enzymolysis and manntol was selected as stablisher of osmotic pressure of enzymolysis, higher regeneration ratio of P. igniarius protoplast also would be obtained in following regeneration step at same time keeping higher yield. For the regeneration processing, it was beneficial for the regeneration of P. igniarius protoplast that PDA plusing mulberry ramulus was used as the culture medium of regeneration and manntol was selected as the osmotic pressure establisher of regeneration culture medium. The method and conditions to keep both higher yield and regeneration ratio of P. igniarius protoplast were obtained. 
22483046	20120410	Fungal_Biol	D016428 D013485 	The feruloyl esterase gene family of Fusarium graminearum is differentially regulated by aromatic compounds and hosts.	Feruloyl esterases can liberate ferulic acid (FA) from plant cell wall polymers. They are expressed by plant pathogenic fungi and could play a role in pathogenicity, although this question has not been addressed yet. The fungus Fusarium graminearum is the principal causal agent of fusarium head blight (FHB) and gibberella ear rot (GER), major diseases of wheat, barley, and maize in all temperate regions of the world. The F. graminearum genome contains seven genes with strong homology to feruloyl esterase (FAE) sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these included three type B, three type C, and one type D FAE genes. Expression profiling of the seven FAE genes showed complex regulation patterns unique to each gene. In F. graminearum-infected plant tissues, the FAE genes exhibited host-specific gene expression. On wheat, FAEB1 and FAED1 were strongly expressed while FAEB2, FAEB3, and FAEC1 were expressed at more modest levels. On maize, only FAEB3, FAEC1, and FAED1 were expressed and at low levels. When growing F. graminearum in liquid culture, only FAEB1 and FAEC1 were expressed. Both genes were induced by a small group of related aromatic compounds including FA, caffeic acid, and p-coumaric acid. FAEB1 was induced by xylose, while repressed by glucose and galactose. FAEC1 was constitutively expressed at low levels in the presence of those sugars. Expression of the other five FAE genes was not detected in the culture conditions used. To determine if FAE genes were important for pathogenicity of F. graminearum, mutant strains inactivated for faeB1∆, faeD1∆ or both genes were constructed and tested on wheat plants. No statistically significant change in pathogenicity and no compensatory expression of the other FAE genes were observed in the fae gene mutants. Our results show that FAEB1 and FAED1 are not required for pathogenicity of F. graminearum on wheat.

An extracellular alpha-galactosidase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from a locust bean gum-spent culture fluid of a mannanolytic strain of the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus. Molecular mass of the enzyme is 57 kDa. The pure enzyme which has a glycoprotein nature, afforded several forms on IEF, indicating its microheterogeneity. Isoelectric point of the major form was 5.2. Enzyme is the most active against aryl alpha-D-galactosides but efficiently hydrolyzed alpha-glycosidically linked non-reducing terminal galactopyranosyl residues occurring in natural substrates such as melibiose, raffinose, stachyose, and fragments of galactomannan. In addition, the enzyme is able to catalyze efficient degalactosylation of polymeric galactomannans leading to precipitation of the polymers. Stereochemical course of hydrolysis of two substrates, 4-nitrophenyl alpha-galactopyranoside and galactosyl(1)mannotriose, followed by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, pointed out the alpha-anomer of D-galactose was the primary product of hydrolysis from which the beta-anomer was formed by mutarotation. Hence the enzyme is a retaining glycosyl hydrolase. In accord with its retaining character the enzyme catalyzed transgalactosylation from 4-nitrophenyl alpha-galactopyranoside as a glycosyl donor. Amino acid sequence alignment of N-terminal and two internal sequences suggested that the enzyme is a member of family 27 of glycosyl hydrolases.

Mutanases hydrolyze d-glucosidic linkages of α-1,3-linked polysaccharides which are important components of dental plaque. Therefore, these enzymes can be useful in preventive oral hygiene. A gene encoding mutanase was cloned from soil-isolated Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus MP-1 and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the resulting recombinant enzyme was characterized. The nucleotide sequence of the mutanase gene consisted of 3786 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1261 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 131.62kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a high degree of similarity with mutanases of Paenibacillus sp. KSM-M126 and Paenibacillus humicus NA1123, with 84% and 80% identity, respectively. The recombinant enzyme was purified 17.5-fold to homogeneity with a recovery of 37%. The purified mutanase showed optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 45°C, and was completely stable at pH 4.0-9.5 and up to 45°C. The enzyme was specific for α-1,3-glucosidic linkages and effectively solubilized fungal α-1,3-glucans and streptococcal mutans, releasing nigerooligosaccharides. The mutanase did not hydrolyze a synthetic substrate readily hydrolyzed by exoglucanases and the enzyme activity was not suppressed in the presence of deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of exo-type enzymes. These results suggest an endohydrolytic mode of action.

The cmc2 gene, coding for an endoglucanase 2 (CMC2) of Aspergillus aculeatus, was cloned using both genomic and cDNA libraries, and sequenced. The gene consists of 1230 bp encoding a protein of 410 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 43,697 Da. The CMC2, composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the family 5 of glycosyl hydrolases and a C-terminal cellulose-binding domain (CBD) belonging to the family I of CBDs, showed identity with other fungal endoglucanases, particularly with that of A. niger, A. nidulans, A. kawachii and A. aculeatus. The transcription of the cmc2 gene in A. aculeatus cells that were grown on different carbon sources was measured. Analysis by the ribonuclease protection assay revealed that expression of the cmc2 gene is induced by cellulose and some disaccharides and repressed by glucose. 
1041692	19751001	Biotechnol._Bioeng.	D016428 	Kinetic studies of mold alpha-galactosidase on PNPG hydrolysis.	The kinetic properties of alpha-galactosidase of Mortierella vinacea were investigated in detail using PNPG (p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside) as a substrate. Consequently, the enzyme was markedly inhibited not only by the substrate, but also by the galactose hydrolized. The initial rate of reaction at sufficiently high substrate concentrations, however, did not fall to zero and did approach a finite value. Galactose behaved as a mixed inhibitor and was neither totally competitive nor totally noncompetitive. A rate equation was obtained from a generalized equation derived from a kinetic model which took both the inhibitions into consideration. The constants used in the equation were appropriately estimated. The calculated rate agreed fairly well with the observed initial rate. Moreover, the PNPG hydrolysis progressing in a batch system was found to be approximately representable by simple first order kinetics in which the rate constant was dependent on the initial substrate concentration.

An N-acetyl-D-[14C]glucosamine radiolabel incorporation assay has been used to monitor chitin biosynthesis in whole cells of Candida albicans both in vitro and in vivo in two different mouse infection models, one using the peritoneal cavity as a chamber in which to add and retrieve cells and the other using infected kidneys. Specific labeling of chitin in alkali-insoluble material was confirmed by chitinase digestion, analysis of acid hydrolysates, and the use of nikkomycin Z as a probe. Nikkomycin Z was shown to strongly inhibit chitin biosynthesis in C. albicans grown in vitro and in vivo in both models. This demonstrates that nikkomycin Z-susceptible chitin synthase activity is present in C. albicans when the fungus is in its pathogenic state in vivo. The limited use of nikkomycin as a therapeutic agent is discussed.

Municipal solid waste contains high amounts of cellulose, which is an ideal organic waste for the growth of most of microorganism as well as composting by potential microbes. In the present study, Congo red test was performed for screening of microorganism, and, after selecting a potential strains, it was further used for biodegradation of organic municipal solid waste. Forty nine out of the 250 different microbes tested (165 belong to fungi and 85 to bacteria) produced cellulase enzyme and among these Trichoderma viride was found to be a potential strain in the secondary screening. During the biodegradation of organic waste, after 60 days, the average weight losses were 20.10% in the plates and 33.35% in the piles. There was an increase in pH until 20 days. pH however, stabilized after 30 days in the piles. Temperature also stabilized as the composting process progressed in the piles. The high temperature continued until 30 days of decomposition, after which the temperature dropped to 40°C and below during the maturation. Good quality compost was obtained in 60 days.

The biosynthesis of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharides in D. discoideum is initiated by the transfer of a large precursor glycan from a carrier lipid. The subsequent processing of this precursor is dramatically dependent upon the stage of development. In early development processing retains the high mannose structure of the precursor and modifies some glycans by addition of fucose to core sugars and sulfate and phosphate to others. These reactions are coordinately lost during aggregation. Processing in late development extensively trims the precursor and adds fucose to peripheral mannose units of the smallest glycans. These reactions appear coincident with formation of tips on cell mounds. Experiments in which cells were starved in shaken suspension suggest that intercellular contacts and cyclic AMP signals may be sufficient to cause the controlled expression of these two alternate sets of processing enzymes. 
14512430	20030927	J._Biol._Chem.	D003160 D016428 	Quantitative analysis of GAL genetic switch of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Gal80p results in a highly sensitive response to galactose.	The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the repressor Gal80p is known to play a pivotal role in the signal transduction process of GAL genetic switch of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Peng, G., and Hopper, J. E. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 8548-8553). We have developed a comprehensive model of this GAL switch to quantify the expression from the GAL promoter containing one or two Gal4p-binding sites and to understand the biological significance of the shuttling process. Our experiments show that the expression of proteins from the GAL promoter containing one and two binding sites for Gal4p is ultrasensitive (a steep response to a given input). Furthermore, the model revealed that the shuttling of Gal80p is the key step in imparting ultrasensitive response to the inducer. During induction, free Gal80p concentration is altered by sequestration, without any change in the distribution coefficient across the nuclear membrane. Furthermore, the estimated concentrations of Gal80p and Gal3p allow basal expression of alpha-galactosidase, but not beta-galactosidase, from the GAL promoter containing one and two binding sites for Gal4p, respectively. Conversely, the expression from genes with two binding sites is more sensitive to inducer concentration as compared with one binding site. We show that autoregulation of Gal80p is coincidental to the autoregulation of Gal3p, and it does not impart ultrasensitivity. We conclude from our analysis that the ultrasensitivity of the GAL genetic switch is solely because of the shuttling phenomena of the repressor Gal80p across the nuclear membrane.

The cell wall of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici was digested with chitinase to analyze the structure of its chitinous components. In spite of a similar acetylation degree of the cell wall components to that of 25-35% acetylated chitosan, only N-acetylglucosamine disaccharide [(GlcNAc)2] was obtained from chitinase hydrolyzate of the fungal cell wall by CM-Sephadex C-25 column chromatography, while (GlcNAc)2 and several types of deacetylated chitooligosaccharides were separated from that of 25-35% acetylated chitosan. The results indicate that N-acetylglucosamine residues in the polysaccharide chains of the fungal cell wall are most likely condensed into some region, while acetylated residues are more scattered in 25-35% acetylated chitosan.

The effect of several nutritional and environmental parameters on growth and amylase production from Rhizopus microsporus var. rhizopodiformis was analysed. This fungus was isolated from soil of the Brazilian "cerrado" and produced high levels of amylolytic activity at 45 degrees C in liquid medium supplemented with starch, sugar cane bagasse, oat meal or cassava flour. Glucose in the culture medium drastically repressed the amylolytic activity. The products of hydrolysis were analysed by thin layer chromatography, and glucose was detected as the main component. The amylolytic activity hydrolysed several substrates, such as amylopectin, amylase, glycogen, pullulan, starch, and maltose. Glucose was always the main end product detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis. These results indicated that the amylolytic activity studied is a glucoamylase, but there were also low levels of alpha-amylase. As compared to other fungi, R. microsporus var. rhizopodiformis can be considered an efficient producer of thermostable amylases, using raw residues of low cost as substrates. This information is of technological value, considering the importance of amylases for industrial hydrolysis.

Thirty-four strains of seven species of Trichoderma isolated from various fungal sources were compared for direct mycoparasitic activity (MPA), chitinase production and antibiotic activity (ANA) in order to choose the most appropriate partners for a strain-breeding programme. Within species genetic differences were also assesses in T. hamatum, T. harzianum and T. viride by means of random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Endochitinase activities of the Trichoderma strains ranged between 20.4 and 1264.5 units/g dry weight of mycelium. The correlation between MPA and chitinase activity was not unambiguous and no correlation existed between MPA and ANA. The RAPD patterns of T. viride strains were highly variable, while isolates of T. harzianum proved to be more uniform; T. hamatum revealed remarkable intraspecific divergence. All these three comprised certain pairs of strains that are promising participants of a strain-improving programme, since their strong genetic affinities offer good changes for combining their contrasted biocontrol traits.

Plant immunization for resistance against a wide variety of phytopathogens is an effective strategy for plant disease management. Seventy-nine plant growth-promoting fungi (PGPFs) were isolated from rhizosphere soil of India. Among them, nine revealed saprophytic ability, root colonization, phosphate solubilization, IAA production, and plant growth promotion. Seed priming with four PGPFs exhibited early seedling emergence and enhanced vigour of a tomato cultivar susceptible to the bacterial wilt pathogen compared to untreated controls. Under greenhouse conditions, TriH_JSB27 and PenC_JSB41 treatments remarkably enhanced the vegetative and reproductive growth parameters. Maximum NPK uptake was noticed in TriH_JSB27-treated plants. A significant disease reduction of 57.3% against Ralstonia solanacearum was observed in tomato plants pretreated with TriH_JSB27. Furthermore, induction of defence-related enzymes and genes was observed in plants pretreated with PGPFs or inoculated with pathogen. The maximum phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity (111U) was observed at 24h in seedlings treated with TriH_JSB27 and this activity was slightly reduced (99U) after pathogen inoculation. Activities of peroxidase (POX, 54U) and β-1,3-glucanase (GLU, 15U) were significantly higher in control plants inoculated with pathogen after 24h and remained constant at all time points. A similar trend in gene induction for PAL was evident in PGPFs-treated tomato seedlings with or without pathogen inoculation, whereas POX and GLU were upregulated in control plus pathogen-inoculated tomato seedlings. These results determine that the susceptible tomato cultivar is triggered after perception of potent PGPFs to synthesize PAL, POX, and GLU, which activate defence resistance against bacterial wilt disease, thereby contributing to plant health improvement.

The secretion of 1,4-beta-D-glucanases by the basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune in response to cellulose or cellobiose has been studied. The proteins were labeled with 35S, and the secretion of enzymes was measured by beta-glucosidase and carboxymethyl cellulase activities and by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. The antigen proteins used were a beta-glucosidase (Mr, 93,000), an avicelase (avicelase II; Mr, 64,000), and a carboxymethyl cellulose (carboxymethyl cellulase I; Mr 41,000). The beta-glucosidase was initially secreted as an Mr 110,000 form, which was followed later by lower-molecular-weight (88,000 to 93,000) forms. The avicelase II, which accounted for about 50% of the secreted labeled protein, had an Mr of 64,000. Secretion of the related avicelase I (Mr 61,000) followed later. The carboxymethyl cellulose I was secreted in two molecular weight forms, Mr 44,000 and 41,000. The evidence is consistent with the idea that three genes account for the secreted glucanase activities. Other species result from different glycosylation or proteolytic cleavage processing, which may occur during or after secretion. The beta-glucosidase secretion appears to be regulated differently than that of avicelase II or carboxymethyl cellulase I; the latter two were regulated coordinately under the conditions used in this work. No common immune determinants between the three antigens were observed.

Cellulose occurs in all higher plants and some algae, fungi, bacteria, and animals. It forms microfibrils containing the crystalline allomorphs, cellulose I alpha and I beta. Cellulose molecules are 500-15,000 glucose units long. What controls molecular size is unknown. Microfibrils are elongated by particle rosettes in the plasma membrane (cellulose synthase complexes). The precursor, UDP-glucose, may be generated from sucrose at the site of synthesis. The biosynthetic mechanism may involve lipid-linked intermediates. Cellulose synthase has been purified from bacteria, but not from plants. In plants, disrupted cellulose synthase may form callose. Cellulose synthase genes have been isolated from bacteria and plants. Cellulose-deficient mutants have been characterised. The deduced amino acid sequence suggests possible catalytic mechanisms. It is not known whether synthesis occurs at the reducing or nonreducing end. Endoglucanase may play a role in synthesis. Nascent cellulose molecules associate by Van der Waals and hydrogen bonds to form microfibrils. Cortical microtubules control microfibril orientation, thus determining the direction of cell growth. Self-assembly mechanisms may operate. Microfibril integration into the wall occurs by interactions with matrix polymers during microfibril formation.

Conidia of Trichoderma harzianum F-340, an active producer of fungal mutanase, were mutagenized with physical and chemical mutagens used separately or in combination. After mutagenesis, the drop in conidia viability ranged from 0.004% to 71%. Among the applied mutagens, nitrosoguanidine gave the highest frequency of cultures with enhanced mutanase activity (98%). In total, 400 clones were isolated, and preliminarily evaluated for mutanase activity in flask microcultures. Eight most productive mutants were then quantified for mutanase production in shake flask cultures. The obtained results fully confirmed a great propensity of all the tested mutants to synthesize mutanase, the activity of which increased from 59 to 107% in relation to the parental T. harzianum culture. The best mutanase-overproducing mutant (T. harzianumn F-340-48), obtained with nitrosoguanidine, produced the enzyme activity of 1.36 U/ml (4.5 U/mg protein) after 4 days of incubation in shake flask culture. This productivity was almost twices higher than that achieved by the initial strain F-340, and, at present, is the best reported in the literature. The potential application of mutanase in dentistry is also discussed.

Fermentation kinetics of Penicillium aculeatum ATCC 10409 demonstrated that fungal growth and dextranase release are decoupled. Inoculation by conidia or mycelia resulted in identical kinetics. Two new isoenzymes of the dextranase were characterized regarding their kinetic constants, pI, MW, activation energy and stabilities. The larger enzyme was 3-fold more active (turnover number: 2,230 +/- 97 s(-1)). Pre-treatment of bentonite with H(2)O(2) did not affect adsorption characteristics of dextranase. Enzyme to bentonite ratios above 0.5:1 (w/w) resulted in a high conservation of activity upon adsorption. Furthermore, dextranase could be used in co-immobilizates for the direct conversion of sucrose into isomalto-oligosaccharides (e.g. isomaltose). Yields of co-immobilizates were 2-20 times that of basic immobilizates, which consist of dextransucrase without dextranase. 
3499155	19870801	Biotechnol._Appl._Biochem.	D016428 	Translational control of alpha-amylase gene expression in Aspergillus awamori.	Regulation of alpha-amylase gene expression in Aspergillus awamori was studied by analyzing the enzyme activity levels, rate of protein synthesis, and alpha-amylase-specific mRNA levels under various conditions of growth. alpha-Amylase synthesis was sensitive to catabolite repression as glucose repressed its synthesis by about fourfold. The stimulation of alpha-amylase synthesis in the presence of its substrate starch was shown to be due to derepression rather than induction as the enzyme was synthesized at similar rates in both starch and starvation media. Repression and derepression of enzyme synthesis was found to be mediated at the translational level. The cellular levels of alpha-amylase-specific mRNA as measured by an in vitro translation assay system, were almost identical under all conditions of enzyme synthesis. Relative in vivo and in vitro alpha-amylase mRNA template activities suggest that alpha-amylase mRNA is translated much more efficiently during the derepression than under the conditions of repressed synthesis. 
10514255	19991009	Biotechnol._Prog.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Enteric bacterial catalysts for fuel ethanol production.	The technology is available to produce fuel ethanol from renewable lignocellulosic biomass. The current challenge is to assemble the various process options into a commercial venture and begin the task of incremental improvement. Current process designs for lignocellulose are far more complex than grain to ethanol processes. This complexity results in part from the complexity of the substrate and the biological limitations of the catalyst. Our work at the University of Florida has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of Enteric bacteria using genes encoding Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. These two genes have been assembled into a portable ethanol production cassette, the PET operon, and integrated into the chromosome of Escherichia coli B for use with hemicellulose-derived syrups. The resulting strain, KO11, produces ethanol efficiently from all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose. By using the same approach, we integrated the PET operon into the chromosome of Klebsiella oxytoca to produce strain P2 for use in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process for cellulose. Strain P2 has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose, eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes. Recently, the ability to produce and secrete high levels of endoglucanase has also been added to strain P2, further reducing the requirement for fungal cellulase. The general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts using the PET operon has been most successful with Enteric bacteria but was also extended to Gram positive bacteria, which have other useful traits for lignocellulose conversion. Many opportunities remain for further improvements in these biocatalysts as we proceed toward the development of single organisms that can be used for the efficient fermentation of both hemicellulosic and cellulosic substrates.

The purification and characterization of a novel extracellular beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from the thermophilic fungus Paecilomyces thermophila J18 were studied. The strain produced the maximum level of extracellular beta-glucanase (135.6 U mL(-1)) when grown in a medium containing corncob (5%, w/v) at 50 degrees C for 4 days. The crude enzyme solution was purified by 122.5-fold with an apparent homogeneity and a recovery yield of 8.9%. The purified enzyme showed as a single protein band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 38.6 kDa. The molecular masses were 34.6 kDa and 31692.9 Da when detected by gel filtration and mass spectrometry, respectively, suggesting that it is a monomeric protein. The enzyme was a glycoprotein with a carbohydrate content of 19.0% (w/w). Its N-terminal sequence of 10 amino acid residues was determined as H2N-A(?)GYVSNIVVN. The purified enzyme was optimally active at pH 7.0 and 70 degrees C. It was stable within pH range 4.0-10.0 and up to 65 degrees C, respectively. Substrate specificity studies revealed that the enzyme is a true beta-1,3-1,4-D-glucanase. The K m values determined for barley beta-D-glucan and lichenan were 2.46 and 1.82 mg mL(-1), respectively. The enzyme hydrolyzed barley beta-D-glucan and lichenan to yield bisaccharide, trisaccharide, and tetrasaccharide as the main products. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the protein contains 28% alpha-helix, 24% beta-sheet, and 48% random coil. Circular dichroism spectroscopy is also used to investigate the thermostability of the purified enzyme. This is the first report on the purification and characterization of a beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from Paecilomyces sp. These properties make the enzyme highly suitable for industrial applications. 
12729604	20030506	Anal._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Separation and quantification of cellulases and hemicellulases by capillary electrophoresis.	Cellulases and hemicellulases are two classes of enzymes produced by filamentous fungi and secreted into the cultivation medium. Both classes of enzymes consist of a subset of classes of which the fungi produce several enzymes with varying molecular mass and pI but similar enzymatic activities. Current methods are limited in their ability to quantify all of these enzymes when all are present simultaneously in a mixture. Five different cellulases (two cellobiohydrolases and three endoglucanases) and one hemicellulase (endoxylanase) were separated using capillary electrophoresis (CE) in a fused silica capillary at pH values close to neutral. The improvement of the separation of these six proteins by the addition of alpha,omega-diaminoalkanes with chain lengths from three to seven carbon units was investigated. Dynamically coating the capillary with 1,3-diaminopropane resulted in separation of the six enzymes and the reproducibility of the migration times was between 0.6 and 1.9%. Two cases-quantitative determination of the enzyme concentrations in cultivation samples and investigation of adsorption of the enzymes onto cellulose-demonstrated the advantages and perspectives of CE analysis of these broad groups of enzymes.

Sorghums were stressed with pathogenic fungi and sprinkling to determine relationships between changes in chitinase and sormatin in caryopses and grain mold resistance. Panicles of 10 cultivars differing in mold resistance and accumulation of antifungal proteins (AFPs) were inoculated at anthesis with Fusarium moniliforme and Curvularia lunata spores. Panicles were sampled at 30 and 50 days after anthesis, and caryopses were evaluated for chitinase and sormatin using western blots. Sprinkling panicles (to mimic rainfall) decreased sormatin and chitinase in most cultivars. Inoculation decreased AFPs in susceptible cultivars, but resistant cultivars maintained or increased AFPs in caryopses. Grain mold resistance corresponded to induction of AFP synthesis in response to sprinkling, fungal stress, and/or adverse field conditions. Sormatin and chitinase appear to be an active part of the defense mechanism of the caryopsis against grain mold.

Microbiol. 61:2885-2890, 1995) was introduced into a mutant parental host, Aspergillus awamori var. kawachi, in which the original glaA gene had been completely deleted and replaced with the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. The modified glaA was successfully expressed and secreted. The modified glucoamylase possessed higher digestibility of raw corn starch and higher stabilities in response to heat and extreme pH. 
17428646	20070413	Microbiol._Res.	D016428 	Solubilization and characterization of a cell wall-bound trehalase from ascospores of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.	The genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacks sequence homologs to ath1 genes coding for acid trehalases in other yeasts or filamentous fungi. However, acid trehalase activity is present at the spore stage in the life cycle of the fission yeast. The enzyme responsible for this activity behaves as a surface enzyme covalently linked to the spore cell walls in both wild-type and ntp1 mutant strains devoid of neutral trehalase. Lytic treatment of particulated cell wall fractions allowed the solubilization of the enzyme into an active form. We have characterized this soluble enzyme and found that its kinetic parameters, optimum pH and temperature, thermal denaturation and salt responses are closely similar to other conventional acid trehalases. Hence, this rather unusual enzyme can be recognized as acid trehalase by its biochemical properties although it does not share genetic homology with other known acid trehalases. The potential role of such acid trehalase in the mobilization of trehalose is discussed.

D016428 D013485 	A region of the cellobiohydrolase I promoter from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei mediates glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, dependent on mitochondrial activity.	The upstream activating region that controls cellulose-induced expression of the glucose-repressible cellobiohydrolase I gene (UARcb1) of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is shown to mediate transcription and glucose repression of a reporter gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a unicellular microorganism that lacks the genes required for the utilization of cellulose. Glucose-controlled transcription mediated by UARcb1 requires the products of the genes SNF1 and SSN6, a protein kinase and a repressor, respectively, that regulate glucose-repressible yeast genes. Previously, it has been shown that mitochondrial function is implicated in cellobiohydrolase I gene expression in T. reesei and this sensitivity to the metabolic state of the mitochondria was shown to be transcriptionally controlled by the 5'-flanking sequence of the cbh1 gene [Abrahão-Neto et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 10456-10462]. Remarkably, transcription of the reporter gene controlled by UARcb1 in S. cerevisiae also showed a requirement for active mitochondria, suggesting that a common mechanism involving mitochondrial activity controls glucose-repressible genes in both microorganisms. 
8454341	19930401	Infect._Immun.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and biochemical characterization of the iC3b receptor of Candida albicans.	In an effort to identify the protein structure on Candida albicans, pseudohyphal forms which had been shown earlier to bind human iC3b, a protein of about 42 kDa (p42), were obtained from lysates of pseudohyphal forms by absorption with C3(H2O)-Sepharose. An antiserum raised in rabbits against this protein effectively inhibited adherence of sheep erythrocytes carrying iC3b (EAC3bi) to pseudohyphal forms. p42 cross-reacted with OKM-1, a monoclonal antibody directed against the human complement receptor type 3 (CR3, CD11b). This protein, p42, was designated p42-CR3. The antiserum against p42-CR3 was used for further purification of lysates by affinity chromatography. Three proteins of 66, 55, and 42 kDa were isolated. All were recognized by OKM-1 in immunoblots (p66-, p55-, and p42-CR3). The different proteins were separated and treated with neuraminidase and endoglycosidase F. Almost complete deglycosylation of the p66-CR3 protein was obtained after treatment with neuraminidase, indicating a high degree of glycosylation. Neuraminidase also had an effect on p55-CR3, but not on p42-CR3. Endoglycosidase F did not alter any of the three proteins. In ligand blots, p42-CR3 bound C3(H2O), C3b, and iC3b but not C3d; p55-CR3 clearly reacted with C3(H2O) and weakly reacted with C3b and iC3b. p66-CR3 never showed reactivity. It is suggested that p55 and p66 represent glycosylated forms of p42-CR3. Although C. albicans CR3 and human CR3 cross-react and bind identical ligands, the two receptors differ in structure. 
21726866	20110706	J_Chromatogr_A	D023362 D016428 D013485 	Capillary zone electrophoresis for the analysis of glycoforms of cellobiohydrolase.	Cellobiohydrolase (CBH) is an important enzyme for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol. This work separated the glycoforms of CBH possessing different numbers of neutral mannoses using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) in a 50 mM, pH 7.5 phosphate buffer. The method analysed CBH in an intact form using a polyacrylamide coated fused silica capillary without requiring additives or labelling of the enzyme. The migration time of the major peak was found to be 21.6±0.1 min (n=3) and the approach is suitable for testing of batch-to-batch consistency of CBH. Ease-of-use, automation and speed are the other benefits due to which the use of CZE for analysing glycoforms of CBH was concluded to be ideal.

A low molecular mass cutinase (designated TtcutA) from Thielavia terrestris was purified and biochemically characterized. The thermophilic fungus T. terrestris CAU709 secreted a highly active cutinase (90.4 U ml(-1)) in fermentation broth containing wheat bran as the carbon source. The cutinase was purified 19-fold with a recovery yield of 4.8 %. The molecular mass of the purified TtcutA was determined as 25.3 and 22.8 kDa using SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, respectively. TtcutA displayed optimal activity at pH 4.0 and 50 °C. It was highly stable up to 65 °C and in the broad pH range 2.5-10.5. Extreme stability in high concentrations (80 %, v/v) of solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile, isopropanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide was observed for the enzyme. The K                 (m) values for this enzyme towards p-nitrophenyl (pNP) acetate, pNP butyrate, and pNP caproate were 7.7, 1.0, and 0.52 mM, respectively. TtcutA was able to efficiently degrade various ester polymers, including cutin, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) at hydrolytic rates of 3 μmol h(-1) mg(-1) protein, 1.1 mg h(-1) mg(-1) protein, 203.6 mg h(-1) mg(-1) protein, and 56.4 mg h(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively. Because of these unique biochemical properties, TtcutA of T.                 terrestris may be useful in various industrial applications in the future.

An endo-1,3-beta-D: -glucanase gene, designated as bglS27, was cloned from Streptomyces sp. S27 and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The full-length gene contains 1,362 bp and encodes a protein of 453 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 42.7 kDa. The encoded protein comprises a catalytic module of glycosyl hydrolase family 16, a short glycine linker region, and a family 13 carbohydrate-binding module. The purified recombinant enzyme (BglS27) showed optimal activity at 65 degrees C and pH 5.5 and preferentially catalyzed the hydrolysis of glucans with a beta-1,3-linkage using an endolytic mode of action. The specific activity and K(m) value of BglS27 for laminarin were 236.0 U mg(-1) and 1.89 mg ml(-1), respectively. In antifungal assay, BglS27 had the ability to inhibit the growth of phytopathogenic fungi Rhizoctonic solani and Fusarium oxysporum and some mycotoxin-producing fungi Fusarium crookwellense and Paecilomyces variotii. These favorable properties make BglS27 a good candidate for utilization in biotechnological applications such as plant protection, feed, and food preservation.

The Saccharomycopsis fibuligera alpha-amylase gene was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of its own promoter.

10564469	19991117	Mol._Microbiol.	D016428 	A constitutive role for GPI anchors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: cell wall targeting.	GPI anchors are widely represented among organisms and have several cellular functions. It has been proposed that in yeast there are two groups of GPI proteins: plasma membrane-resident proteins, such as Gas1p or Yap3p, and cell wall-targeted proteins, such as Tir1p or alpha-agglutinin. A model has been proposed for the plasma membrane retention of proteins from the first group because of a dibasic motif located just upstream of the GPI-anchoring signal. The results we report here are not in agreement with such a model as we show that constructs containing the C-terminal parts of Gas1p and Yap3p are also targeted to the cell wall. We also detect the genuine Gas1p after cell wall treatment with Quantazyme or Glucanex glycanases. In addition, we show that the GPI-anchoring signal from the human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) is not compatible with the yeast machinery unless the human transamidase hGpi8p is co-expressed. In this condition, this human signal is able to target a protein to the cell wall. Moreover, TIR1 proved to be a multicopy suppressor of Deltagas1 mutation. The present findings suggest a constitutive role for GPI anchors in yeast: the cell wall targeting of proteins.

Cloning of two novel promoters from Yarrowia lipolytica.	We have compared expression systems based on autonomously replicating vectors in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces lactis, Hansenula polymorpha and Yarrowia lipolytica in order to identify a more suitable host organism for use in the expression cloning method (Dalbøge and Heldt-Hansen, 1994) in which S. cerevisiae has traditionally been used. The capacity of the expression systems to secrete active forms of six fungal genes encoding the enzymes galactanase, lipase, polygalacturonase, xylanase and two cellulases was examined, as well as glycosylation pattern, plasmid stability and transformation frequency. All of the examined alternative hosts were able to secrete more active enzyme than S. cerevisiae but the relative expression capacity of the individual hosts varied significantly in a gene-dependent manner. One of the most attractive of the alternative host organisms, Y. lipolytica, yielded an increase which ranged from 4.5 times to more than two orders of magnitude. As the initially employed Y. lipolytica XPR2 promoter is unfit in the context of expression cloning, two novel promoter sequences for highly expressed genes present in only one copy on the genome were isolated. Based on sequence homology, the genes were identified as TEF, encoding translation elongation factor-1 alpha and RPS7, encoding ribosomal protein S7. Using the heterologous cellulase II (celII) and xylanase I (xylI) as reporter genes, the effect of the new promoters was measured in qualitative and quantitative assays. Based on the present tests of the new promoters. Y. lipolytica appears as a highly attractive alternative to S. cerevisiae as a host organism for expression cloning. 
19148637	20090117	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Evaluation and characterization of Trichoderma reesei cellulase and xylanase promoters.	Comprehensive analyses on promoters of four cellulase and one xylanase genes of Trichoderma reesei were performed expressing a single reporter uidA from Escherichia coli to construct highly functional cellulase-overproducing strains. GUS amount expressed under each promoter correlated entirely with each mRNA amount, suggesting that GUS production was controlled at the transcriptional level. The uidA transcript levels were much lower than the native gene mRNAs, but they were produced in proportion to the mRNA of native cellulase and xylanase genes driven by the same promoters except for the cbh2 promoter. Cellulose-degrading activity and protein amount was reduced in cbh1 and cbh2 disruptant mutants compared to the wild-type T. reesei PC-3-7 and other uidA transformants. The cbh1 disruptant strain was observed to produce more CBH II, EG I, EG III, and xylanases than native PC-3-7 and the other uidA transformants with the same amounts of protein in SDS-PAGE gels. This observation was further analyzed by measuring mRNA levels of cellulase and xylanase genes in the disruptants using quantitative real-time PCR. In the Pcbh1-gus, mRNA levels for cbh2 and egl1 genes were higher than those in native T. reesei PC-3-7 and all other disruptant strains. The cbh2 disruptant strain had the highest amount of cbh1 mRNA among the strains tested. Homologous integration of uidA at the egl1, egl3, and xyn3 loci was also found to cause a slight increased level of cbh1 mRNA, whereas mRNA levels for egl1, egl3, and xyn3 in all the disruptants were similar to those of T. reesei PC-3-7. 
10747977	20000405	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Architectural principles for the structure and function of the glucocorticoid receptor tau 1 core activation domain.	A 58-amino acid region mediates the core transactivation activity of the glucocorticoid receptor tau1 activation domain. This tau1 core domain is unstructured in aqueous buffers, but in the presence of trifluoroethanol three alpha-helical segments are induced. Two of these putative structural modules have been tested in different combinations with regard to transactivation potential in vivo and binding capacity to the coactivators in vitro. The results show that whereas single modules are not transcriptionally active, any combination of two or three modules is sufficient, with trimodular constructs having the highest activity. However, proteins containing one, two, or three segments bind Ada2 and cAMP-response element-binding protein with similar affinity. A single segment is thus able to bind a target factor but cannot transactivate target genes significantly. The results are consistent with models in which activation domains are comprised of short activation modules that allow multiple interactions with coactivators. Our results also suggest that an increased number of modules may not result in correspondingly higher affinity but instead that the concentration of binding sites is increased, which gives rise to a higher association rate. This is consistent with a model where the association rate for activator-target factor interactions rather than the equilibrium constant is the most relevant measure of activator potency. 
21223334	20110113	FEMS_Microbiol._Ecol.	D016428 D013485 	Impact of endochitinase-transformed white spruce on soil fungal communities under greenhouse conditions.	Chitinase genes isolated from plants, bacteria or fungi have been widely used in genetic engineering to enhance the resistance of crops and trees to fungal pathogens. However, there are concerns about the possible effect of chitinase-transformed plants on nontarget fungi. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of endochitinase-transformed white spruce on soil fungal communities. Endochitinase-expressing white spruce and untransformed controls were transplanted in soils from two natural forests and grown for 8 months in a greenhouse. Soil fungal biomass and diversity, estimated through species richness and Shannon and Rao diversity indices, were not different between transgenic and control tree rhizospheres. The fungal phylogenetic community structure was the same in soil samples from control and transgenic white spruces after 8 months. Soil type and presence of seedlings had a much more significant impact on fungal community structure than the insertion and expression of the ech42 transgene within the white spruce genome. The results suggest that the insertion and constitutive expression of the ech42 gene in white spruce did not significantly affect soil fungal biomass, diversity and community structure.

We investigated the genetic causes of ethanol tolerance by characterizing mutations selected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303-1A under the selective pressure of ethanol. W303-1A was subjected to three rounds of turbidostat, in a medium supplemented with increasing amounts of ethanol. By the end of selection, the growth rate of the culture has increased from 0.029 to 0.32 h(-1) . Unlike the progenitor strain, all yeast cells isolated from this population were able to form colonies on medium supplemented with 7% ethanol within 6 days, our definition of ethanol tolerance. Several clones selected from all three stages of selection were able to form dense colonies within 2 days on solid medium supplemented with 9% ethanol. We sequenced the whole genomes of six clones and identified mutations responsible for ethanol tolerance. Thirteen additional clones were tested for the presence of similar mutations. In 15 of 19 tolerant clones, the stop codon in ssd1-d was replaced with an amino acid-encoding codon. Three other clones contained one of two mutations in UTH1, and one clone did not contain mutations in either SSD1 or UTH1. We showed that the mutations in SSD1 and UTH1 increased tolerance of the cell wall to zymolyase and conclude that stability of the cell wall is a major factor in increased tolerance to ethanol. 
10840595	20000607	Bioseparation	D016428 D013485 	Anion exchange purification of plasmid DNA using expanded bed adsorption.	Recent developments in gene therapy with non-viral vectors and DNA vaccination have increased the demand for large amounts of pharmaceutical-grade plasmid DNA. The high viscosity of process streams is of major concern in the purification of plasmids, since it can cause high back pressures in column operations, thus limiting the throughput. In order to avoid these high back pressures, expanded bed anion exchange chromatography was evaluated as an alternative to fixed bed chromatography. A Streamline 25 column filled with 100 ml of Streamline QXL media, was equilibrated with 0.5 M NaCl in TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH = 8.0) buffer at an upward flow of 300 cmh-1, E. coli lysates (obtained from up to 3 liters of fermentation broth) were injected in the column. After washing out the unbound material, the media was allowed to sediment and the plasmid was eluted with 1 M NaCl in TE buffer at a downward flow of 120 cmh-1. Purification factors of 36 +/- 1 fold, 26 +/- 0.4 plasmid purity, and close to 100% yields were obtained when less than one settled column volume of plasmid feed was injected. However, both recovery yield and purity abruptly decreased when larger amounts were processed-values of 35 +/- 2 and 5 +/- 0.7 were obtained for the recovery yield and purity, respectively, when 250 ml of feedstock were processed. In these cases, gel clogging and expansion collapse were observed. The processing of larger volumes, thus larger plasmid quantities, was only possible by performing an isopropanol precipitation step prior to the chromatographic step. This step led to an enhancement of the purification step.

In an effort to understand how fungi degrade biomass, we grew Phanerochaete chrysosporium on sorghum stover and chronicled the growth of the fungus over the course of 14 days. The fungal mass grew steadily until the fifth day, reaching 0.06 mg of cells per milligram of dry mass, which fell by the seventh day and stayed at nearly the same level until day 14. After 1 day, hemicellulases, cellulases, and polygalacturonases were detected in the extracellular fluid at 1.06, 0.34, and 0.20 U/ml, respectively. Proteomic studies performed with the extracellular fluid using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry identified 57, 116, and 102 degradative enzymes targeting cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin, proteins, and lipids on days 1, 7, and 14, respectively. Significant concentrations of breakdown products of the sorghum polysaccharides were detected in the extracellular fluid indicating that the enzymes were breaking the polysaccharides, and after 14 days, almost 39% of the sorghum sugars had been used by the fungus. Our results suggest that P. chrysosporium produces a set of enzymes to degrade the components of lignocellulose from the beginning of its growth, but modifies the complement of enzymes it secretes over time to adapt to the particular substrate available.

Chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) is one of the major pathogenesis-related proteins, which is a polypeptide that accumulates extracellularly in infected plant tissue. An attempt was made to isolate and purify the chitanase enzyme using moth beans as an enzyme source. The enzyme was isolated and purified from moth beans against the fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina strain 2165. The isolation and purification was done in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Purification of chitinase was carried out to obtain three fractions, viz. 50°C heated, ammonium sulfate precipitated and sephadex G-25 column-eluted fractions. The molecular mass of Chitinase was directly estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryamide gel electroresis (SDS-PAGE). The yield is sufficient for initial characterization studies of the enzyme. The molecular study of the enzyme shows the possibility of generating the defense mechanism in plants in which it cannot occur. Chitinase was purified by gel filtration chromatography with 20.75-fold and 32.78-fold purification in the in vitro and in vivo conditions, respectively. The enzyme shows a maximum activity after 90 min with 0.1 ml of colloidal chitin as a substrate and 0.4 ml of crude chitinase extract. The optimum pH of 5.0 and an optimum temperature of 40°C was found for maximal activity. The molecular weight of purified chitinase was estimated to be 30 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The chitinase isolated in both in vitro and in vivo conditions is stable andactive.

Although Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary has been studied extensively, there are still aspects of this important phytopathogen's ability to cause disease in susceptible plants that remain unclear. A recent comprehensive proteome-level investigation of this fungus identified a number of proteins whose functions in disease initiation and progression have not been clearly established. Included among these proteins was an arabinofuranosidase/beta-xylosidase precursor whose role as a potential virulence factor had not been investigated previously. This article describes the generation of gene-disrupted mutant S. sclerotiorum unable to produce this arabinofuranosidase/beta-xylosidase precursor as well as the comparison of the virulence of this mutant with that of wild-type mycelia on susceptible canola leaves and stems. At all time points tested, the degree of necrosis was observed to be significantly greater on the plant tissue inoculated with wild-type mycelia. To our knowledge, this is the first report that clearly demonstrates that this arabinofuranosidase/beta-xylosidase precursor is a virulence factor for S. sclerotiorum.

The largest cDNA (Mfcut1) was found to contain an open reading frame of 603 bp that predicted a 20.2-kDa protein of 201 amino acids with a 20-amino-acid secretory signal peptide and a pI of 8.4. The predicted protein contained cutinase/lipase consensus sequences with active site serines and potential protein kinase phosphorylation sites. Comparison of the deduced amino sequence from Mfcut1 with other fungal cutinase sequences revealed new features, which include conserved cysteines, C-terminal aromatic residues, and a novel histidine substitution in the D-H active site motif. The presence in the growth medium of antioxidants, such as caffeic acid, suppressed mRNA accumulation and enzyme activity of a cutinase from M. fructicola. MFCUT1 was expressed at high levels as a His-tagged fusion protein in Pichia pastoris and purified to apparent homogeneity in a single step by Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Analysis of variant MFCUT1 mutants in which the novel serine and histidine residues were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis indicated that these residues had an important effect on enzyme activity. 
11706050	20011114	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485 D013487 	Yeast Cdc42 functions at a late step in exocytosis, specifically during polarized growth of the emerging bud.	The Rho family GTPase Cdc42 is a key regulator of cell polarity and cytoskeletal organization in eukaryotic cells. In yeast, the role of Cdc42 in polarization of cell growth includes polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, which delivers secretory vesicles to growth sites at the plasma membrane. We now describe a novel temperature-sensitive mutant, cdc42-6, that reveals a role for Cdc42 in docking and fusion of secretory vesicles that is independent of its role in actin polarization. cdc42-6 mutants can polarize actin and deliver secretory vesicles to the bud, but fail to fuse those vesicles with the plasma membrane. This defect is manifested only during the early stages of bud formation when growth is most highly polarized, and appears to reflect a requirement for Cdc42 to maintain maximally active exocytic machinery at sites of high vesicle throughput. Extensive genetic interactions between cdc42-6 and mutations in exocytic components support this hypothesis, and indicate a functional overlap with Rho3, which also regulates both actin organization and exocytosis. Localization data suggest that the defect in cdc42-6 cells is not at the level of the localization of the exocytic apparatus. Rather, we suggest that Cdc42 acts as an allosteric regulator of the vesicle docking and fusion apparatus to provide maximal function at sites of polarized growth.

Pseudomonas corrugata, a soil bacterium originally isolated from a temperate site of Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) is examined for its antagonistic activities against two phytopathogenic fungi, Alternaria alternata and Fusarium oxysporum. Although the bacterium did not show inhibition zones due to production of diffusible antifungal metabolites, a reduction in growth between 58% and 49% in both test fungi, A. alternata and F. oxysporum, was observed in sealed Petri plates after 120 h of incubation due to production of volatile antifungal metabolites. Reduction in biomass of A. alternata (93.8%) and F. oxysporum (76.9%) in Kings B broth was recorded after 48 h of incubation in dual culture. The antagonism was observed to be affected by growth medium, pH and temperature. The reduction in fungal biomass due to antagonism of bacteria was recorded maximum in the middle of the stationary phase after 21 h of inoculation. The production of siderophore, ammonia, lipase and chitinase in growth medium by P. corrugata were considered contributing to the antagonistic activities of the bacterium. 
2225145	19900801	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Cloning and expression of a second Aspergillus niger pectin lyase gene (pelA): indications of a pectin lyase gene family in A. niger.	Using the previously cloned Aspergillus niger N756 pectin lyase D gene as a probe, the corresponding pelD gene has been isolated from a genomic library of the laboratory strain A. niger N400. This gene encodes PLD, previously described as PLI, which is one of the two major pectin lyases isolated from the commercial pectinase preparation Ultrazym. Heterologous hybridization of the A. niger N400 genomic library with the pelD gene led to the isolation of another five genes: pelA, B, C, E, and F. These genes differ in their hybridization patterns with probes containing either the entire pelD gene, or 5' or 3' parts thereof. By partial sequencing, and expression in an A. niger transformant containing multiple copies of the pelA gene, we show that this gene, which hybridizes strongest with the pelD gene, encodes the other major pectin lyase from Ultrazym, PLII.

Twelve isolates of Trichoderma (six of T. harzianum, five of T. viride, one of T. virens), which reduced variably the incidence of collar rot disease caused in peanut by Aspergillus niger Van Tieghem, were evaluated for their potential to produce lytic enzymes during in vitro antagonism. T. viride 60 inhibited highest (86.2%) growth of test fungus followed by T. harzianum 2J (80.4%) at 6 days after inoculation (DAI) on PDA media. The specific activities of chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase and protease were 11, 3.46 and 9 folds higher in T6 antagonist (T. viride 60 and A. niger interactions) followed by 8.72, 2.85 and 9 folds in T8antagonist (T. harzianum 2J and A. niger interactions), respectively, compared to the activity produced by control petri plate T13 (A. niger alone) at 6 DAI. Activity of these lytic enzymes induced in antagonists' plates comprises the growth of Trichoderma isolates. However, cellulase and poly galacturonase were found least amount in these antagonists treatment. A significant positive correlation (p=0.01) between percentage growth inhibition of test fungus and lytic enzymes - (chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase and protease) in the culture medium of antagonist treatment established a relationship to inhibit growth of fungal pathogen by increasing the levels of these enzymes. Among the Trichoderma isolates, T. viride 60 was found best strain to be used in biological control of plant pathogen A. niger.  
18973283	20081101	Biotechnol._Bioeng.	D023362 D016428 D013485 D013486 	An optimized microplate assay system for quantitative evaluation of plant cell wall-degrading enzyme activity of fungal culture extracts.	Developing enzyme cocktails for cellulosic biomass hydrolysis complementary to current cellulase systems is a critical step needed for economically viable biofuels production. Recent genomic analysis indicates that some plant pathogenic fungi are likely a largely untapped resource in which to prospect for novel hydrolytic enzymes for biomass conversion. In order to develop high throughput screening assays for enzyme bioprospecting, a standardized microplate assay was developed for rapid analysis of polysaccharide hydrolysis by fungal extracts, incorporating biomass substrates. Fungi were grown for 10 days on cellulose- or switchgrass-containing media to produce enzyme extracts for analysis. Reducing sugar released from filter paper, Avicel, corn stalk, switchgrass, carboxymethylcellulose, and arabinoxylan was quantified using a miniaturized colorimetric assay based on 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid. Significant interactions were identified among fungal species, growth media composition, assay substrate, and temperature. Within a small sampling of plant pathogenic fungi, some extracts had crude activities comparable to or greater than T. reesei, particularly when assayed at lower temperatures and on biomass substrates. This microplate assay system should prove useful for high-throughput bioprospecting for new sources of novel enzymes for biofuel production. 
16739943	20060603	Biotechnol._Prog.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Major antifungal activity from the bulbs of Indian squill Urginea indica is a chitinase.	We have identified a chitinase with antifungal activity in the bulbs of the plant Urginea indica(Indian squill) and purified it about 26-fold. The purified preparation contained a Mr 29 kDa protein that was an active growth inhibitor of the fungal pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani in an in vitro assay. Amino acid sequence analysis of the Mr 29 kDa protein revealed it to be highly homologous to the family 19 glycoside hydrolases, which are known to possess chitinase activity. The U. indica chitinase lacked a cysteine-rich N-terminal domain (characteristic of class I chitinases) and contained a conserved motif indicative of the signature 1 of family 19 glycoside hydrolases. It shared a approximately 70% sequence identity with the 26 kDa endochitinase of Hordeum vulgare, a typical class II chitinase of family 19. The five cysteines in the partial sequence of the Mr 29 kDa chitinase were found to be identical in location to five of the seven cysteines present in the catalytic domain of the H. vulgare enzyme. The molecular weight, the lack of an N-terminal cysteine-rich sequence, and the striking identity to the H. vulgare endochitinase suggest that the Mr 29 kDa U. indica protein is a putative class II chitinase. The antifungal activity is presumably mediated through the chitinolytic activity of the Mr 29 kDa protein.

The production of enzymes capable of degrading the cell walls of invading phytopathogenic fungi is an important component of the defense response of plants. The timing of this natural host defense mechanism was modified to produce fungal-resistant plants. Transgenic tobacco seedlings constitutively expressing a bean chitinase gene under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter showed an increased ability to survive in soil infested with the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani and delayed development of disease symptoms. 
9662611	19980715	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Effect of N-linked glycosylation on secretion, activity, and stability of alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae.	The effect of N-linked glycosylation on secretion, activity, and stability of alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae grown as dispersed filaments was studied. In the presence of tunicamycin the fungus grew either as dispersed filaments or as one large pellet, whereas growth was as dispersed filaments in all control cultures. The presence of tunicamycin affected neither biomass, level of secreted alpha-amylase, nor total amount of secreted protein in cultures growing as dispersed filaments. In these cultures both glycosylated and nonglycosylated alpha-amylase appeared in the culture medium as well as in the cells, whereas in control cultures only the glycosylated form of alpha-amylase was found in the medium and in the cells. The presence of nonglycosylated alpha-amylase in the medium seemed to result from active secretion rather than from autolysis of the mycelium or extracellular deglycosylation. Deglycosylation with Endo H of crude alpha-amylase in culture filtrate did not affect its stability towards heat, acid pH, or proteolytic degradation.

D003160 D016428 D013485 	Combination of Trichoderma harzianum endochitinase and a membrane-affecting fungicide on control of Alternaria leaf spot in transgenic broccoli plants.	Progeny from transgenic broccoli (cv. Green Comet) expressing a Trichoderma harzianum endochitinase gene were used to assess the interaction between endochitinase and the fungicide Bayleton in the control of Alternaria brassicicola. In vitro assays have shown synergistic effects of endochitinase and fungicides on fungal pathogens. Our study examined the in planta effects of endochitinase and Bayleton, individually and in combination. Two month old transgenic and non-transgenic plants were sprayed with ED50 levels of Bayleton and/or inoculated with an A. brassicicola spore suspension. Disease levels in non-sprayed transgenic plants were not statistically different from sprayed transgenic plants nor from sprayed non-transgenic controls. Thus endochitinase-transgenic plants alone provided a significant reduction of disease severity, comparable to the protection by fungicide on non-transgenic plants. Comparison of the expected additive and observed effects revealed no synergism between endochitinase and Bayleton (at ED50 level), and usually less than an additive effect. Some transgenic lines sprayed with fungicide at doses higher than ED50 showed resistance similar to the non-sprayed transgenic lines, again suggesting no synergistic effect. Lack of synergism may be due to incomplete digestion of the cell wall by endochitinase, so that the effect of Bayleton at the cell membrane is not enhanced.

D016428 	An immobilized two-enzyme system (fungal alpha-amylase/glucoamylase) and its use in the continuous production of high conversion maltose-containing corn syrups.	Fungal alpha-amylase (E.C. 3.2.1.1) and glucoamylase (E.C. 3.2.1.3) were chemically attached to separate reactor modules made from Microporous Plastic Sheet (MPS). Immobilization of enzymes and subsequent chemical reactions were accomplished by pumping reactants through the sheet, i.e., perpendicular to the surface. The expressed activity of the reactor modules was ca. 800 U/g for both fungal alpha-amylase and glucoamylase. The kinetics and short-term effects of pH and temperature on the expressed activity of the immobilized enzymes were investigated. Using commercially available DE-42 corn syrup at 50% dissolved solids, half-lives of 2000 and 5000 h were achieved for glucoamylase and fungal alpha-amylase, respectively. The reactors were operated at 50 degrees C and at pH 4.3 for glucoamylase and 5.5 for fungal alpha-amylase. A typical DE-62 corn syrup product was continuously produced in a two-stage reactor system by pumping the feedstock through the glycoamylase reactor and then through the fungal alpha-amylase reactor. Saccharide distributions at each stage were controllable to +/-0.2%.

L(+)-lactic acid production was investigated using an enzymatic hydrolysate of waste office automation (OA) paper in a culture of the filamentous fungus Rhizopus oryzae. In 4 d culture, 82.8 g/l glucose, 7 g/l xylose, and 3.4 g/l cellobiose contained in the hydrolysate were consumed to produce 49.1 g/l of lactic acid. The lactic acid yield and production rate were only 0.59 g/g and 16.3 g/l/d, respectively, only 75% and 61% of the results from the glucose medium. The low production rate from waste OA hydrolysate was elucidated by trials using xylose as the sole carbon source; in those trials, the lactic acid production rate was 7.3 g/l/d, only 28% that of glucose or cellobiose. The low lactic acid yield from waste OA hydrolysate was clarified by trials using artificial hydrolysates comprised of 7:2:1 or 7:1:2 ratios of glucose:cellobiose:xylose. For both, the lactic acid production rate of 17.4 g/l/d matched that of waste OA paper, while the lactic acid yield was similar to that of the glucose medium. This indicates that the production rate may be inhibited by xylose derived from hemicellulose, and the yield may be inhibited by unknown compounds derived from paper pulp. 
18068392	20071211	Microbes_Infect.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Human chitotriosidase is expressed in the eye and lacrimal gland and has an antimicrobial spectrum different from lysozyme.	Chitotriosidase is a chitinolytic enzyme expressed by maturing macrophages and preformed in neutrophil granules, suggesting a role in antimicrobial defence. Although available evidence supports a role in anti-fungal immunity, there is a lack of an obvious phenotype in humans homozygous for a mutation which renders chitotriosidase inactive. This may be explained by compensatory effects of enzymes co-expressed with chitotriosidase, such as lysozyme. We have found that chitinase is highly expressed in mouse and human eye, particularly in lacrimal glands. Chitotriosidase is the only member of the chitinase/chilectin gene cluster expressed in the murine eye. As lacrimal glands also produce lysozyme, we have asked whether chitotriosidase, in addition to its documented anti-fungal effects, has synergistic anti-bacterial properties with lysozyme. The effect of recombinant chitotriosidase on the growth of five Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus aureus OatA(+/-)) and two Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), were tested in a luminometric assay. Recombinant chitotriosidase did not inhibit bacterial growth and did not synergize with lysozyme. Though the expression of chitotriosidase in the eye supports a role in innate immunity, the antimicrobial spectrum appears to be complementary to lysozyme and may indeed be limited to fungi.

Monoclinic crystals of a neutral alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae, containing three molecules in the asymmetric unit, have been reported previously and studied at 3 A resolution [Matsuura, Kunusoki, Harada & Kakudo (1984). J. Biochem. 95, 697-702]. Here we report the solution of the structure of this enzyme in a different crystal form (space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), a = 50.9, b = 67.2, c = 132.7 A), with only one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method, using a model of acid alpha-amylase from a related fungus A. niger [Brady, Brzozowski, Derewenda, Dodson & Dodson (1991). Acta Cryst. B47, 527-535]. Conventional least-squares crystallographic refinement failed to converge in a satisfactory manner, and the technique of molecular dynamics in the form of the XPLOR package [Brunger (1988). XPLOR Manual. Yale Univ., USA] was used to overcome the problem. A large rigid-body type movement of the C-terminal domain was identified and accounted for. The final round of restrained least-squares refinement (at 2.1 A resolution) including 3675 protein atoms and 247 water molecules resulted in a conventional crystallographic R factor of 0.183 and an atomic model which conforms well to standard stereochemical parameters (standard deviation of bond lengths from their expected values is 0.028 A, while that for planar groups is 0.029 A). 
24280385	20131128	Plant_Cell	D016428 D013485 	Endoplasmic reticulum glucosidases and protein quality control factors cooperate to establish biotrophy in Ustilago maydis.	Secreted fungal effectors mediate plant-fungus pathogenic interactions. These proteins are typically N-glycosylated, a common posttranslational modification affecting their location and function. N-glycosylation consists of the addition, and subsequent maturation, of an oligosaccharide core in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. In this article, we show that two enzymes catalyzing specific stages of this pathway in maize smut (Ustilago maydis), glucosidase I (Gls1) and glucosidase II β-subunit (Gas2), are essential for its pathogenic interaction with maize (Zea mays). Gls1 is required for the initial stages of infection following appressorium penetration, and Gas2 is required for efficient fungal spreading inside infected tissues. While U. maydis Δgls1 cells induce strong plant defense responses, Δgas2 hyphae are able to repress them, showing that slight differences in the N-glycoprotein processing can determine the extent of plant-fungus interactions. Interestingly, the calnexin protein, a central element of the ER quality control system for N-glycoproteins in eukaryotic cells, is essential for avoiding plant defense responses in cells with defective N-glycoproteins processing. Thus, N-glycoprotein maturation and this conserved checkpoint appear to play an important role in the establishment of an initial biotrophic state with the plant, which allows subsequent colonization.

The hemicellulase activity included enzymes acting on all the major components of wood hemicellulose. 5. The main starch-degrading enzyme was a glucoamylase. 6. Laminarin-degrading activity was produced when cellulose, hemicellulose or starch was used as carbon source for the fungus and it may be involved in the re-utilization of hyphal carbon or of a reserve polysaccharide synthesized during active growth of the organism. 
22851449	20120802	Adv._Exp._Med._Biol.	D016428 D016454 	GAPDH, as a virulence factor.	Pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi, generate molecules that provide them with a selective advantage, often at the expense of the host. These molecules, or virulence factors, enable pathogens to colonize the host through several mechanisms. Some molecules offer the pathogen an advantage through better adhesion to host tissues, or superior invasive capability. Some allow the pathogen to evade or suppress the host's immune system. Some molecules enable intracellular parasites to disable cytoprotective mechansims, by re-directing the host phagocytic vesicles. Many of these molecules are proteins that are exported to the cell's surface or are secreted. As unlikely as it seems, GAPDH appears to play a role as a virulence factor in a number of pathogenic organisms by the mechanisms just described. This highly conserved protein is found on the outer surface or as a secretory product of these organisms. The process by which pathogenic GAPDH, which has >40 % sequence identity to human GAPDH, is exported and attached to the outer surface of cells remains unknown. This chapter also presents a previously unpublished proposed docking sequence on GAPDH. There is also discussion of the potential of using the antigenic properties of pathogenic GAPDH for medical as well as for veterinary purposes.

Selective delignification and hemicellulose removal were performed on white rot fungus-pretreated residues to investigate the effects of lignin and hemicellulose removal on enzymatic hydrolysis. 43.66-77% of lignin with small part of hemicellulose were degraded by chlorite treatment, while 79.97-95.09% of hemicellulose with little lignin were degraded by dilute acid treatment, indicating that cross effect between lignin and hemicellulose was minimized. In subsequent enzymatic digestion, regardless of the cellulase loading, residues from series-grade delignification released more glucose and xylose than that from hemicellulose removal, suggesting that lignin rather than hemicellulose in fungi-pretreated residues played a dominant role in hindering enzymatic hydrolysis. Based on the fundamental mechanisms of acidic/alkaline pretreatments in literature, it is proposed that fungal pretreatment prefers to integrate with alkaline pretreatment rather than acidic pretreatment to maximize the synergy. This indication would be helpful to optimize and renovate the integrated pretreatment.

A new lignolytic micromycete fungus Myrothecium roridum LG7 was isolated and selected for biological delignification of agro residue-paddy straw and herbaceous weed Parthenium sp. Physical and chemical modifications in the biomass following pretreatment with M. roridum LG7 for 7 days in term of structural modification and lignin removal, changes in lignin skeleton, and alteration of cellulose crystallinity was observed through SEM-EDXA, FTIR and XRD analysis, respectively. Colonization of the fungus led to high amount of lignin removal (5.8-6.98mg/gds) from pretreated biomass which could be recovered as a value added product. Enzymatic hydrolysis of M. roridum LG7 pretreated biomass released significantly higher amount of reducing sugars (455.81-509.65 mg/gds) as compared to respective raw biomass within 24h. This study illustrates the promise of M. roridum LG7 for biological pretreatment through structural and chemical alteration of biomass beside creation of alkaline environment which prevent the growth of other contaminants.

Previous studies showed that when pPSX-vioABCDE was used to transform E. coli K12 DH5alpha the strain retained the plasmid even after 100 generations of unselected growth but produced a low level of the anti-tumour antibiotic violacein. Markedly higher levels of violacein synthesis were obtained from E. coli K12 DH5alpha pUC18-vioABCDE and Sphingomonas sp. JMP4092 pPSX-vioABCDE. Unfortunately, both strains were extremely unstable regardless of presence or absence of antibiotic selection to retain the plasmid. The current study was undertaken to determine if strains of E. coli K12 could be isolated which stably over produce violacein. When a range of E. coli K12 strains were transformed with pPSX-vioABCDE, most produced small amounts of violacein. However, a small number of related strains of E. coli K12 JM101, JM105 and JM109 not only over-produced violacein, but also maintained the high stability. In addition, E. coli K12 JM109 strongly expressed an alpha amylase gene (amyA) from Streptomyces lividans indicating that the S. lividans amyA promoter is highly active in E. coli K12 JM109. In another set of experiments, a violacein overproduction mutation (opv-1) of the plasmid pPSX-vioABCDE was isolated which enabled E. coli K12 DH5alpha to overproduce violacein while retaining high stability. The plasmid pPSX-vioABCDEopv-1 possesses a single base pair deletion in the promoter region of the violacein operon. By combining the over producing strain E. coli K12 JM109 and the over producing plasmid pPSX-vioABCDEopv-1, a stable hyper producing strain (E. coli K12 JM109 pPSX-vioABCDEopv-1) was constructed. Finally, two additional stable vectors, pPSX10 and pPSX20, were constructed to facilitate subcloning and functional analysis studies.

It was established, as a result of investigation of kinetic properties of two fungal glycosidases (alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and alpha- galactosidase), that Km and Vmax for the corresponding synthetic substrates were 1.19 and 1.25 mM, 25.0 and 10.5 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. a-Galactosidase and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase were also competitively inhibited by the reaction products - D-galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, the inhibition constants were 8.5 x 10(-3) and 6.2 x 10(-2) M, respectively. One could also observe the inhibition of alpha-galactosidase reaction in the presence of 10(-3) M of fucose, lactose and arabinose. It was shown that the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of nitrophenyl substrates was directly proportional to the concentration of enzymes, and the increase of the substrate concentration leads to the increase of hydrolysis rate. The substrate concentration being increased above the optimal one (3.6 mg/ml), the decrease of the reaction rate owing to the formation of inactive enzyme-substrate complex FS2 may be observed.

A combination of directed engineering and metabolic evolution has resulted in microbial biocatalysts that produce up to 45 g L(-1) ethanol in 48 h in a simple mineral salts medium, and convert various lignocellulosic materials to ethanol. Mutations contributing to ethanologenesis are discussed.

A 52-bp region with promoter activity was found immediately upstream of the chiA open reading frame. Insertional inactivation of the chromosomal copy of the gene confirmed that expression of chitinase activity by V. cholerae required chiA. Fluorescent analogues were used to demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of ChiA was specific for beta,1-4 glycosidic bonds located between GlcNAc monomers in chitin. Antibodies against ChiA were obtained by immunization of a rabbit with a MalE-ChiA hybrid protein. Polypeptides with antigenic similarity to ChiA were expressed by classical and El Tor biotypes of V. cholerae and by the closely related bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila. Immunoblotting experiments using the wild-type strain 569B and the secretion mutant M14 confirmed that ChiA is an extracellular protein which is secreted by the eps system. The eps system is also responsible for secreting cholera toxin, an oligomeric protein with no amino acid homology to ChiA. These results indicate that ChiA and cholera toxin have functionally similar extracellular transport signals that are essential for eps-dependent secretion.

D016428 	Metabolic engineering of bacteria for ethanol production 	Technologies are available which will allow the conversion of lignocellulose into fuel ethanol using genetically engineered bacteria. Assembling these into a cost-effective process remains a challenge. Our work has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of enteric bacteria using a portable ethanol production pathway. Genes encoding Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase have been integrated into the chromosome of Escherichia coli B to produce strain KO11 for the fermentation of hemicellulose-derived syrups. This organism can efficiently ferment all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose. Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1 has been genetically engineered in a similar manner to produce strain P2 for ethanol production from cellulose. This organism has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose, eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes. The optimal pH for cellulose fermentation with this organism (pH 5.0-5.5) is near that of fungal cellulases. The general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts has been most successful with enteric bacteria thus far. However, this approach may also prove useful with Gram-positive bacteria which have other important traits for lignocellulose conversion. Many opportunities remain for further improvements in the biomass to ethanol processes. These include the development of enzyme-based systems which eliminate the need for dilute acid hydrolysis or other pretreatments, improvements in existing pretreatments for enzymatic hydrolysis, process improvements to increase the effective use of cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes, improvements in rates of ethanol production, decreased nutrient costs, increases in ethanol concentrations achieved in biomass beers, increased resistance of the biocatalysts to lignocellulosic-derived toxins, etc. To be useful, each of these improvements must result in a decrease in the cost for ethanol production.

7929854	19940801	J_Immunoassay	D016428 	Dyed particle capture immunoassay for detection of incipient brown-rot decay.	An immunological method for detecting incipient fungal decay in wood is described. Monoclonal antibody to extracellular beta-1,4-xylanase of the brown-rot fungus Postia placenta was immobilized in a defined capture zone to a strip of hydrophobic polyester cloth. Polyclonal-labeled latex particles were applied near one end of the polyester assay substrate. The resulting test strip was dipped into extracts from wood blocks inoculated with various wood decay fungi. Extracts flowed laterally through the antibody-labeled latex particles and the capture zone. When antigen was present in the extract, the antigen was complexed by the monoclonal and labeled-polyclonal antibodies to form an observable particle complex in the zone of capture. Wood samples were tested at various stages of decay and correlated with wood weight loss. Incipient brown-rot decay was detected with the particle capture immunoassay at less than 2 percent wood weight loss.

Linear DNA plasmids were found in the following yeasts: four strains of Kluyveromyces lactis, one of Debaryomyces hansenii, one of Wingea robertsiae and four of Pichia etchellsii. In each case, the plasmids were present as a pair of DNA molecules of different sizes. The plasmids of K. lactis strains were associated with a killer activity and their structure was similar to the known killer plasmids pGKL1 and 2. The plasmids from the other three species were different from pGKL plasmids and showed no killer activity against the yeast species tested so far. In all cases, the linear molecules possessed terminal (probably inverted) repeats and their 5' ends had a protected structure insensitive to lambda exonuclease, while the 3' ends were accessible to exonuclease III. All these strains could be efficiently cured of the plasmids by ultraviolet irradiation. The plasmids from D. hansenii (pDH1A and B) and from W. robertsiae (pWR1A and B) shared related sequences with some of the K. lactis killer plasmid genes (encoding the supposed DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase and the chitinase), suggesting related genome organization of these plasmids. The pair of plasmids from P. etchellsii (pPE1A and B) appear to be a distantly related member of the group. This pair showed no sequence homology with other plasmids, except weak homology with the putative RNA polymerase gene of pGKL2. None of the plasmids contained the sequences homologous to ORF3 and ORF4 of pGKL1 encoding the toxin resistance determinant and the toxin gamma subunit, respectively. 
23035824	20121006	Microb._Cell_Fact.	D016428 D013485 	Re-annotation of the CAZy genes of Trichoderma reesei and transcription in the presence of lignocellulosic substrates.	Trichoderma reesei is a soft rot Ascomycota fungus utilised for industrial production of secreted enzymes, especially lignocellulose degrading enzymes. About 30 carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) of T. reesei have been biochemically characterised. Genome sequencing has revealed a large number of novel candidates for CAZymes, thus increasing the potential for identification of enzymes with novel activities and properties. Plenty of data exists on the carbon source dependent regulation of the characterised hydrolytic genes. However, information on the expression of the novel CAZyme genes, especially on complex biomass material, is very limited. In this study, the CAZyme gene content of the T. reesei genome was updated and the annotations of the genes refined using both computational and manual approaches. Phylogenetic analysis was done to assist the annotation and to identify functionally diversified CAZymes. The analyses identified 201 glycoside hydrolase genes, 22 carbohydrate esterase genes and five polysaccharide lyase genes. Updated or novel functional predictions were assigned to 44 genes, and the phylogenetic analysis indicated further functional diversification within enzyme families or groups of enzymes. GH3 β-glucosidases, GH27 α-galactosidases and GH18 chitinases were especially functionally diverse. The expression of the lignocellulose degrading enzyme system of T. reesei was studied by cultivating the fungus in the presence of different inducing substrates and by subjecting the cultures to transcriptional profiling. The substrates included both defined and complex lignocellulose related materials, such as pretreated bagasse, wheat straw, spruce, xylan, Avicel cellulose and sophorose. The analysis revealed co-regulated groups of CAZyme genes, such as genes induced in all the conditions studied and also genes induced preferentially by a certain set of substrates. In this study, the CAZyme content of the T. reesei genome was updated, the discrepancies between the different genome versions and published literature were removed and the annotation of many of the genes was refined. Expression analysis of the genes gave information on the enzyme activities potentially induced by the presence of the different substrates. Comparison of the expression profiles of the CAZyme genes under the different conditions identified co-regulated groups of genes, suggesting common regulatory mechanisms for the gene groups. 
18051302	20071207	J._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	The brown-rot basidiomycete Fomitopsis palustris has the endo-glucanases capable of degrading microcrystalline cellulose.	Two endoglucanases with processive cellulase activities, produced from Fomitopsis palustris grown on 2% microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel), were purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange and gel filtration column chromatography systems. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the molecular masses of the purified enzymes were 47 kDa and 35 kDa, respectively. The amino acid sequence analysis of the 47-kDa protein (EG47) showed a sequence similarity with fungal glycoside hydrolase family 5 endoglucanase from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of the 35-kDa protein (EG35), however, had no homology with any other glycosylhydrolases, although the enzyme had high specific activity against carboxymethyl cellulose, which is a typical substrate for endoglucanases. The initial rate of Avicel hydrolysis by EG35 was relatively fast for 48 h, and the amount of soluble reducing sugar released after 96 h was 100 microg/ml. Although EG47 also hydrolyzed Avicel, the hydrolysis rate was lower than that of EG35. Thin layer chromatography analysis of the hydrolysis products released from Avicel indicated that the main product was cellobiose, suggesting that the brown-rot fungus possesses processive EGs capable of degrading crystalline cellulose. 
17416404	20070410	Chemosphere	D016428 D013485 	Elimination of racemic and enantioenriched metalaxyl based fungicides under tropical conditions in the field.	The elimination has been studied of racemic and enantioenriched metalaxyl applied as an emulsifiable concentrate and wettable powder combined with copper in a Cameroonian field site. The kinetics of the degradation/dissipation of metalaxyl and its acid metabolite were investigated using reversed phase HPLC-MS/MS, while the enantiomeric ratios were measured by HPLC-MS/MS using a Chiralcel OD-H HPLC column. Some soil enzymes activities were determined concurrently for 120d. The elimination of racemic metalaxyl was shown to be enantioselective, with the R-enantiomer being degraded more slowly than the S-enantiomer. Dissipation followed approximate square root first-order kinetics (R>0.98) without lag phases. The enantiomers of metalaxyl have different elimination rates, with half-lives ranging from only 0.8 to 1.5 days. After application to soil, the elimination of metalaxyl in the copper containing formulation was slower. The activities of acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and alkaline glucosidase were monitored throughout the experiments. No significant influence of metalaxyl and copper could be observed on these parameters. The significantly shorter half-life values of all forms of metalaxyl under field conditions, compared to the previously reported laboratory derived ones, may have implications for the plant disease control with these fungicides in tropical rainforest areas. 
22709462	20120620	Microb._Cell_Fact.	D016428 D013485 	Achieving efficient protein expression in Trichoderma reesei by using strong constitutive promoters.	The fungus Trichoderma reesei is an important workhorse for expression of homologous or heterologous genes, and the inducible cbh1 promoter is generally used. However, constitutive expression is more preferable in some cases than inducible expression that leads to production of unwanted cellulase components. In this work, constitutive promoters of T. reesei were screened and successfully used for high level homologous expression of xylanase II. The transcriptional profiles of 13 key genes that participate in glucose metabolism in T. reesei were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The results indicated that the mRNA levels of pdc (encoding pyruvate decarboxylase) and eno (encoding enolase) genes were much higher than other genes under high glucose conditions. Recombinant T. reesei strains that homologously expressed xylanase II were constructed by using the promoters of the pdc and eno genes, and they respectively produced 9266 IU/ml and 8866 IU/ml of xylanase activities in the cultivation supernatant in a medium with high glucose concentration. The productivities of xylanase II were 1.61 g/L (with the pdc promoter) and 1.52 g/L (with the eno promoter), approximately accounted for 83% and 82% of the total protein secreted by T. reesei, respectively. This work demonstrates the screening of constitutive promoters by using RT-qPCR in T. reesei, and has obtained the highest expression of recombinant xylanase II to date by using these promoters. 
17373647	20070322	Biotechnol_J	D023362 D016428 D013485 	Application of cellulose-based self-assembled tri-enzyme system in a pseudo-reagent-less biosensor for biogenic catecholamine detection.	Amorphous cellulose was used as a specific carrier for the deposition of self-assembled multienzyme complexes capable of catalyzing coupled reactions. Naturally glycosylated fungal cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) of glycosyl hydrolase families 6 and 7 were specifically deposited onto the cellulose surface through their family I cellulose-binding modules (CBM). Naturally glycosylated fungal laccase was then deposited onto the preformed glycoprotein layer pretreated by ConA, through the interaction of mannosyl moieties of fungal glycoproteins with the multivalent lectin. The formation of a cellulase-ConA-laccase composite was proven by direct and indirect determination of activity of immobilized laccase. In the absence of cellulases and ConA, no laccase deposition onto the cellulose surface was observed. Finally, basidiomycetous cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) was deposited onto the cellulose surface through the specific interaction of its FAD domain with cellulose. The obtained paste was applied onto the surface of a Clark-type oxygen electrode and covered with a dialysis membrane. In the presence of traces of catechol or dopamine as mediators, the obtained immobilized multienzyme composite was capable of the coupled oxidation of cellulose by dissolved oxygen, thus providing the basis for a sensitive assay of the mediator. Swollen amorphous cellulose plays three different roles in the obtained biosensor as: (i) a gelforming matrix that captures the analyte and its oxidized intermediate, (ii) a specific carrier for protein self-assembly, and (iii) a source of excess substrate for a pseudo-reagent-less assay with signal amplification. The detection limit of such a tri-enzyme biosensor is 50-100 nM dopamine. 
12501351	19970201	J._Gen._Appl._Microbiol.	D016428 	Purification of a chitinase from Trichoderma sp. and its action on Sclerotium rolfsii and Rhizoctonia solani cell walls.	Trichoderma harzianum is an effective biocontrol agent of several important plant pathogenic fungi. This Trichoderma species attacks other fungi by secreting lytic enzymes, including beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinolytic enzymes. Superior biocontrol potential may then be found in strains having a high capacity to produce these enzymes. We have therefore evaluated the capacity of six unidentified Trichoderma spp. isolates to produce chitinolytic enzymes and beta-1,3-glucanases in comparison with T. harzianum 39.1. All six isolates demonstrated substantial enzyme activity. However, while the isolates hereafter called T2, T3, T5, and T7 produced lower amounts of enzymes, the activity of isolates T4 and T6 were 2-3 fold higher than that produced by T. harzianum 39.1. A chitinase produced by the T6 isolate was purified by a single ion-exchange chromatography step and had a molecular mass of 46 kDa. The N-terminal amino-acid sequence showed very high homology with other fungal chitinases. Its true chitinase activity was demonstrated by its action on chitin and the failure to hydrolyze laminarin and p-nitrophenyl-beta-N-acetylglucosaminide. The hydrolytic action of the purified chitinase on the cell wall of Sclerotium rolfsii was convincingly shown by electron microscopy studies. However, the purified enzyme had no effect on the cell wall of Rhizoctonia solani. 
1776362	19911001	Yeast	D016428 	Cell wall glucomannoproteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mnn9.	Mannoproteins were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mnn9 mutant cell walls by laminarinase digestion and purified by affinity and anion-exchange chromatography. The purified mannoprotein fraction contained three predominant proteins with molecular masses of 300 kDa, 220 kDa and 160 kDa. These compounds were absent in an SDS extract of cell walls or in a hot-citrate extract of mnn9 cells. The carbohydrate part of the purified mannoproteins consisted of (N-acetyl)glucosamine, mannose and glucose in a molar ratio of 1:53:4. O-Glycosidically linked chains, containing 70% of the mannose, were released by mild beta-elimination. N-Glycosidically linked chains, representing 80% of the (N-acetyl)glucosamine and 20% of the mannose, were released by peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion. Complete degradation of protein by alkaline hydrolysis released besides the N- and O-glycosidically linked chains, another type of carbohydrate chain containing the residual (N-acetyl)glucosamine, mannose and most of the glucose in a molar ratio of 1:17:18. Glucose was beta-glycosidically linked. The results indicate that beta-glucose is linked to PNGase F-resistant N-linked chains present on cell wall mannoproteins. We propose that these chains are responsible for the linkage between mannoproteins and glucan in the cell wall. 
15180162	20040608	Mycopathologia	D016428 	Expression of pectinase activity among Aspergillus flavus isolates from southwestern and southeastern United States.	Aspergillus flavus is a widely distributed filamentous fungus that contaminates crops with the potent carcinogen aflatoxin. This species can be divided into S and L strains on the basis of sclerotial morphology. During crop infection, A. flavus can secrete a large array of hydrolytic enzymes. These include pectinase, which aids fungal spread through plant tissues. A survey of pectinase expression by soil isolates derived from different regions of the United States revealed geographic polymorphisms. Strain L isolates from Arizona produced moderate to high levels of a specific pectinase P2c, while S strain isolates produced variable amounts of P2c. In contrast, L strain isolates from southeastern U.S. yielded variable P2c production, while S strain isolates consistently expressed high P2c levels. These results were corroborated by pectinase surveys of additional collections of A. flavus from soil and cottonseed. Expression patterns for P2c and pectinmethylesterase were evaluated for a select number of isolates using an isoelectric focusing technique. Clear zone reactions from the pectinase plate assay corresponded to the presence of P2c, while red ring reactions corresponded to the lack of P2c. Commercial cottonseed infected by S strain isolates frequently contained aflatoxin, even when infected by S strain isolates that did not produce pectinase P2c. Thus, although P2c-lacking isolates have reduced invasiveness, these isolates still have sufficient pathogenicity to cause aflatoxin contamination. 
8561466	19950101	Annu._Rev._Microbiol.	D016428 D013486 D016454 	Cellulose degradation in anaerobic environments.	In anaerobic environments rich in decaying plant material, the decomposition of cellulose is brought about by complex communities of interacting microorganisms. Because the substrate, cellulose, is insoluble, bacterial and fungal degradation occurs exocellularly, either in association with the outer cell envelope layer or extracellularly. Products of cellulose hydrolysis are available as carbon and energy sources for other microbes that inhabit environments in which cellulose is biodegraded, and this availability forms the basis of many microbial interactions that occur in these environments. This review discusses interactions among members of cellulose-decomposing microbial communities in various environments. It considers cellulose decomposing communities in soils, sediments, and aquatic environments, as well as those that degrade cellulose in association with animals. These microbial communities contribute significantly to the cycling of carbon on a global scale. 
23393585	20130209	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 	Discovery of glycoside hydrolase enzymes in an avicel-adapted forest soil fungal community by a metatranscriptomic approach.	To discover the structural and functional novel glycoside hydrolase enzymes from soil fungal communities that decompose cellulosic biomass, transcripts of functional genes in a forest soil were analyzed. Pyrosequencing of the Avicel and wheat-amended soil cDNAs produced 56,084 putative protein-coding sequence (CDS) fragments, and the most dominant group of putative CDSs based on the taxonomic analysis was assigned to the domain Eukarya, which accounted for 99% of the total number of the putative CDSs. Of 9,449 eukaryotic CDSs whose functions could be categorized, approximately 40% of the putative CDSs corresponded to metabolism-related genes, including genes involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Among the carbohydrate-metabolism genes, 129 sequences encoded glycoside hydrolase enzymes, with 47 sequences being putative cellulases belonging to 13 GH families. To characterize the function of glycoside hydrolase enzymes, we synthesized the putative CelA gene with codon optimization for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, which was shown to be similar to the structure of plant expansins, and observed stimulation for cellulase activity on Avicel degradation. This study demonstrated that fungal communities adapt to Avicel and wheat decomposition and that metatranscriptomic sequence data can be reference data for identifying a novel gene. 
11131385	20001229	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 D016454 	Genetic transformation and biotechnological application of the yeast Arxula adeninivorans.	The relatively unknown, non-pathogenic, dimorphic, haploid, ascomycetous yeast Arxula adeninivorans exhibits some unusual properties which are of biotechnological interest. The yeast is able to assimilate and ferment many compounds as sole source of carbon and/or nitrogen, it utilises n-alkanes and degrades starch efficiently. A. adeninivorans features such as thermo- and haloresistance as well as the yeast's uncommon growth and secretion behaviour should be especially emphasised. In media containing up to 20% NaCl, A. adeninivorans is able to grow at cultivation temperatures up to 48 degrees C. Additionally, the dimorphism of the yeast is unusual. Arxula grows at up temperatures of up to 42 degrees C as budding cells, which turn into mycelia at higher temperatures. This environmentally conditioned dimorphism is reversible and budding is reestablished when the cultivation temperature is decreased below 42 degrees C. Alteration of morphology correlates with changes in secretion behaviour. Mycelium cultures accumulate two-fold higher protein concentrations and contain two- to five-fold higher glucoamylase and invertase activities in the medium than budding cells. Based on these unusual properties, Arxula adeninivorans is used for heterologous gene expression and as a gene donor to construct more suitable yeasts for biotechnology. For example the Arxula glucoamylase gene was successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis. Both transformed yeasts are able to assimilate and ferment starch as carbon source. A transformation system is used for heterologous gene expression which is based on integration of linearised DNA fragments in two to ten copies, e.g. into the 25S rDNA of A. adeninivorans by homologous recombination. The obtained transformants are mitotically stable. The expression of the lacZ gene from E. coli as well as the XylE gene from Pseudomonas putida indicates the suitability of A. adeninivorans as host for heterologous gene expression. 
15618633	20041225	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Analysis of secreted proteins during conidial germination of Aspergillus oryzae RIB40.	To broaden our understanding of extracellular proteins of Aspergillus oryzae at the conidial germination stage, analyses of the secreted proteins during germination were carried out. Taka-amylase A (TAA), glucoamylase (GLAA), and aspergillopepsin A (PEPA) were identified as the main products by peptide mass fingerprinting. TAA and PEPA were detected simultaneously with the formation of germ tubes. With the development of germination, the pH of the medium fell from 5.5 to 3.5. The secreted PEPA had a pro-sequence and likely shifted from 42 kDa to 41 kDa below pH 4.6, indicating that the precursor of PEPA was secreted and underwent pH-dependent processing. Furthermore, the 41 kDa protein was trapped by the addition of pepstatin A, the specific inhibitor of PEPA, suggesting that the maturation of pro-PEPA was a stepwise autoprocessing upon acidification of the medium and itself was an intermediate of the processing. It was implied that PEPA plays an important role at the early germination stage.

From cultures of thermophilic soil fungus Humicola grisea var thermoidea, a δ-lactam derivative (3-(2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoethyl)-5,6-dihydropyridin-2(1H)-one) that displayed anti-allergic activity was isolated, which was predicted by in silico computational chemistry approaches. The in vitro anti-allergic activity was investigated by β-hexosaminidase release assay in rat basophilic leukaemia RBL-2H3 cells. The δ-lactam derivative exhibited similar anti-allergic activity (IC(50) = 18.7 ± 6.7 µM) in comparison with ketotifen fumarate (IC(50) = 15.0 ± 1.3 µM) and stronger anti-allergic activity than azelastine (IC(50) = 32.0 µM). Also, the MTT cytotoxicity assay with RBL-2H3 cells showed that δ-lactam does not display cytotoxicity at concentrations lower than 50 µM. This study suggests that the δ-lactam derivative has the potential to be used as a lead compound in the development of anti-allergic drugs for clinical use in humans. 
11941460	20020410	Planta	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Chitinase production in pine callus (Pinus sylvestris L.): a defense reaction against endophytes?	In shoot tip-derived tissue cultures of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), browning and subsequent degeneration of the culture is accompanied by lipid peroxidation and lignification of cells, which are characteristic features of a plant defense reaction. Since chitinases are enzymes acting primarily in plant defense, their expression was studied in pine callus in order to elucidate the defense reaction. Chitinases were present diversely in tissue cultures originating from shoot tips and embryos of P. sylvestris, in contrast to Pinus nigra embryogenic callus, where production of chitinases or browning was not detected. Because endophytic microbes had earlier been detected in buds of Scots pine, their subsequent presence in the tissue cultures was considered a potential cause of the defense reaction. Therefore, the presence of endophytes in the tissue cultures was examined by in situ hybridization. Endophytes were found to colonize heavily in 45% of the tissue cultures of P. sylvestris and to form biofilms, while the P. nigra callus was not found to contain any microbes. The endophytes seemed to propagate uncontrollably once a tissue culture of P. sylvestris was initiated. Regardless of the high level of chitinase production in the callus, the control of the endophytes presumably becomes inadequate during the tissue culture of P. sylvestris.

In this paper we describe the effect of enzyme treatments on the production of polymeric xylan, oligosaccharides and hemicellulose lean pulp by alkaline extraction of bleached hardwood kraft pulp. Enzyme treatments were carried out before one or in between two subsequent alkaline extractions by purified Trichoderma reesei xylanase and endoglucanase II (Cel 5a) as well as by a commercial monocomponent endoglucanase (FibreCareR). Without enzyme pre-treatment 61% and 7% of the pulp xylan was extracted in high purity in the first and second alkaline stage, respectively. Higher molecular mass xylan was obtained in the second than in the first alkaline extraction. Xylanase treatment before alkaline extraction hydrolyzed up to 12% of xylan to xylooligosaccharides. According to our results, preparation of polymeric xylan, and/or oligosaccharides as well as hemicellulose lean pulp with cellulose content of 93-94%, is possible by enzyme-aided alkaline extraction process.

Rhamnosidases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal nonreducing L-rhamnose for the bioconversion of natural or synthetic rhamnosides. They are of great significance in the current biotechnological area, with applications in food and pharmaceutical industrial processes. In this study we isolated and characterized a novel alkaline rhamnosidase from Acrostalagmus luteo albus, an alkali-tolerant soil fungus from Argentina. We also present an efficient, simple, and inexpensive method for purifying the A. luteo albus rhamnosidase and describe the characteristics of the purified enzyme. In the presence of rhamnose as the sole carbon source, this fungus produces a rhamnosidase with a molecular weight of 109 kDa and a pI value of 4.6, as determined by SDS-PAGE and analytical isoelectric focusing, respectively. This enzyme was purified to homogeneity by chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques. Using p-nitrofenil-α-L-rhamnopiranoside as substrate, the enzyme activity showed pH and temperature optima of 8.0 and 55°C, respectively. The enzyme exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with K (M) and V (max) values of 3.38 mmol l(-1) and 68.5 mmol l(-1) min(-1), respectively. Neither divalent cations such as Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+), and Co(2+) nor reducing agents such as β-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol showed any effect on enzyme activity, whereas this activity was completely inhibited by Zn(2+) at a concentration of 0.2 mM. This enzyme showed the capacity to hydrolyze some natural rhamnoglucosides such as hesperidin, naringin and quercitrin under alkaline conditions. Based on these results, and mainly due to the high activity of the A. luteo albus rhamnosidase under alkaline conditions, this enzyme should be considered a potential new biocatalyst for industrial applications. 
848950	19770201	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013486 	Lead inhibition of enzyme synthesis in soil.	Addition of 2 mg of Pb2+/g of soil concident with or after amendment with starch or maltose resulted in 75 and 50% decreases in net synthesis of amylase and alpha-glucosidase, respectively. Invertase synthesis in sucrose-amended soil was transiently reduced after Pb2+ addition. Amylase activity was several times less sensitive to Pb2+ inhibition than was enzyme synthesis. In most cases, the rate of enzyme synthesis returned to control (Pb2+) values 24 to 48 h after the addition of Pb. The decrease in amylase synthesis was paralleled by a decrease in the number of Pb-sensitive, amylase-producing bacteria, whereas recovery of synthesis was associated with an increase in the number of amylase-producing bacteria. The degree of inhibition of enzyme synthesis was related to the quantity of Pb added and to the specific form of lead. PbSO4 decreased amylase synthesis at concentrations of 10.2 mg of Pb2+/g of soil or more, whereas PbO did not inhibit amylase synthesis at 13 mg of Pb2+/g of soil. Lead acetate, PbCl2, and PbS reduced amylase synthesis at total Pb2+ concentrations of 0.45 mg of Pb2+/g of soil or higher. The results indicated that lead is a potent but somewhat selective inhibitor of enzyme synthesis in soil, and that highly insoluble lead compounds, such as PbS, may be potent modifiers of soil biological activity. 
20967206	20101023	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 	Interplant communication of tomato plants through underground common mycorrhizal networks.	Plants can defend themselves to pathogen and herbivore attack by responding to chemical signals that are emitted by attacked plants. It is well established that such signals can be transferred through the air. In theory, plants can also communicate with each other through underground common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) that interconnect roots of multiple plants. However, until now research focused on plant-to-plant carbon nutrient movement and there is no evidence that defense signals can be exchanged through such mycorrhizal hyphal networks. Here, we show that CMNs mediate plant-plant communication between healthy plants and pathogen-infected tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). After establishment of CMNs with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae between tomato plants, inoculation of 'donor' plants with the pathogen Alternaria solani led to increases in disease resistance and activities of the putative defensive enzymes, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and lipoxygenase in healthy neighbouring 'receiver' plants. The uninfected 'receiver' plants also activated six defence-related genes when CMNs connected 'donor' plants challenged with A. solani. This finding indicates that CMNs may function as a plant-plant underground communication conduit whereby disease resistance and induced defence signals can be transferred between the healthy and pathogen-infected neighbouring plants, suggesting that plants can 'eavesdrop' on defence signals from the pathogen-challenged neighbours through CMNs to activate defences before being attacked themselves.

Agaricus bisporus H 25 produced extracellular endo-1, 3-beta-glucanase when grown in a static culture at 25 degrees C in a minimal synthetic medium supplemented with A. bisporus cell walls plus fructose. Endo-1,3-beta-glucanase was purified 17.85-fold from 20-day-old culture filtrates by precipitation at 80% ammonium sulfate saturation, Sephadex G-75 gel filtration, and preparative PAGE followed by electroelution. The purified enzyme yielded a single band in both native and SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a molecular mass of 32 kDa (SDS-PAGE) and 33.7 kDa (MALDI-MS), showing an isoelectric point of 3.7. The enzyme was active against beta-1,3- linkages and, to a lesser extent, against beta-1,6-, exhibiting an endohydrolytic mode of action and a glycoprotein nature. Significant activities of the endo-glucanase against laminarin and pustulan were observed between pH 4 and 5.5, and between 40 degrees and 50 degrees C for laminarin, and between 30 degrees and 50 degrees C for pustulan. The optimum pH and temperature were 4.5 and 45 degrees C for both substrates. 
21415904	20110319	Biotechnol._Genet._Eng._Rev.	D016428 D016454 	Structure and function of enzymes acting on chitin and chitosan.	Enzymatic conversions of chitin and its soluble, partially deacetylated derivative chitosan are of great interest. Firstly, chitin metabolism is an important process in fungi, insects and crustaceans. Secondly, such enzymatic conversions may be used to transform an abundant biomass to useful products such as bioactive chito-oligosaccharides. Enzymes acting on chitin and chitosan are abundant in nature. Here we review current knowledge on the structure and function of enzymes involved in the conversion of these polymeric substrates: chitinases (glycoside hydrolase families 18 & 19), chitosanases (glycoside hydrolase families 8, 46, 75 & 80) and chitin deacetylases (carbohydrate esterase family 4).

Coprophilous fungi inhabit herbivore feces, secreting enzymes to degrade the most recalcitrant parts of plant biomass that have resisted the digestive process. Consequently, the secretomes of coprophilous fungi have high potential to contain novel and efficient plant cell wall degrading enzymes of biotechnological interest. We have used one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS), and quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF LC-MS/MS) to identify proteins from the secretome of the coprophilous fungus Doratomyces stemonitis C8 (EU551185) isolated from koala feces. As the genome of D. stemonitis has not been sequenced, cross-species identification, de novo sequencing, and zymography formed an integral part of the analysis. A broad range of enzymes involved in the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin, and protein were revealed, dominated by cellobiohydrolase of the glycosyl hydrolase family 7 and endo-1,4-β-xylanase of the glycosyl hydrolase family 10. A high degree of specialization for pectin degradation in the D. stemonitis C8 secretome distinguishes it from the secretomes of some other saprophytic fungi, such as the industrially exploited T. reesei. In the first proteomic analysis of the secretome of a coprophilous fungus reported to date, the identified enzymes provide valuable insight into how coprophilous fungi subsist on herbivore feces, and these findings hold potential for increasing the efficiency of plant biomass degradation in industrial processes such as biofuel production in the future.

The effect of pressure on the heat activation in vivo of trehalase in the spores of Phycomyces blakesleeanus has been investigated in order to obtain information about the molecular mechanism of the activation. For a protein conformational change directly induced in the enzyme by the heat treatment an upward shift with about 2-6 K/1000 atm (1.013 X 10(5) kPa) is to be expected in the moderate high-pressure region. On the other hand, for a phospholipid phase transition causing the activation, a continuous upward shift with about 20 K/1000 atm is to be expected. For trehalase activation we find a continuous upward shift of the activation temperature with about 5-9 K/1000 atm. The denaturation of trehalase, which occurs at slightly higher temperatures, is influenced by pressure completely as expected for a protein conformational change. The application of high pressure during spore heat activation makes it possibe to break the dormancy of the spores without concomitant activation of trehalase.

Levels of protein carbonylation in peach fruits inoculated with four antagonistic yeasts (Pichia membranaefaciens, Cryptococcus laurentii, Candida guilliermondii and Rhodotorula glutinis) were significantly reduced in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by Monilinia fructicola. In control fruit without yeast treatments, proteins carbonylation obviously increased after inoculation with M. fructicola, ranging from molecular mass 20 to 120 kDa. However, in yeast-treated fruits, no proteins carbonylation was detected at 1 d, only a small quantity of carbonylation ranging from 28.5 to 45 kDa was found at 2 d. Antagonistic yeasts significantly stimulated the activities of chitinase, beta-1,3-glucanase, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and the expressions of relevant genes during all storage periods. These results suggest that yeast treatments may be related to alleviating proteins carbonylation and mitigating pathogen-induced oxidative damage, which result in decrease of fruit decay and imply that antioxidant defense response may be involved in the mechanisms of microbial biocontrol agents against fungal pathogen. 
16696178	20060516	Int_J_Environ_Res_Public_Health	D016428 D013485 	Changes in soil chemical properties and microbial activities in response to the fungicide Ridomil Gold plus copper.	The purpose of the study was to investigate changes of soil chemical and biological properties changes resulting from a single application of the fungicide Ridomil Gold plus copper (Ridomil Gold plus)(mefenoxam 6% + copper oxide 60%) at the following rates 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 g m(-2). Selected chemical properties generally differed between fungicide rates over longer incubation periods. Microbial activity indices (available N, ammonification rates and specific enzymatic systems) were more sensitive indicators of change. Values of these indicators generally increased with incubation period and decreased or increased at high rates. Significant changes in P availability occurred after 90 days of incubation at rates > or = 1 g m(-2). Incorporation of the fungicide significantly increased NH4+ levels in soil after 75 days of incubation. These changes stimulated soil microbial activity as evidenced by increased ammonification rates especially at long-term exposure. Of the enzyme activities studied, dehydrogenase and beta-glucosidase activities were the most sensitive to ridomil gold plus. This sensitivity was more pronounced with the dehydrogenase activity.

D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and the use of its promoter for expression in Myrothecium gramineum, a novel expression host.	At our laboratory, research has focused on the development of Myrothecium gramineum as a novel expression host. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd)-promoter of M. gramineum was isolated and characterized (Genbank accession number EF486690). In order to prove its functionality and to explore the potential of M. gramineum as a novel fungal expression host, use of this gpd-promoter for the expression of a fungal alpha-amylase was investigated. Myrothecium gramineum was transformed with pGPDlpAmyAO, containing the gpd-promoter followed by the amy3 encoding sequence of Aspergillus oryzae. Study of the amylase production indicated that the promoter can be successfully used for the expression of heterologous proteins in M. gramineum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a homologous expression system has been described for M. gramineum.

A major fraction of monoterpenes and norisoprenoids in young wines is conjugated to sugars representing a significant reservoir of aromatic precursors. To promote their release, β-glucosidase, α-arabinosidase, and α-rhamnosidase from a commercial Aspergillus niger preparation, were immobilized onto acrylic beads. The aim of this work was the development and application of an immobilized biocatalyst, due to the well-known advantages over soluble enzyme preparations: control of the reaction progress and preparation of enzyme-free products. In addition, the obtained derivative showed increased stability in simile wine conditions. After the treatment of Muscat wine with the biocatalyst for 20days, free monoterpenes increased significantly (from 1119 to 2132μg/L, p<0.01) with respect to the control wine. Geraniol was increased 3,4-fold over its flavor thresholds, and accordingly its impact on sensorial properties was very relevant: nine of ten judges considered treated wine more intense in fruit and floral notes.  
12756504	20030521	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Diversification of exogenous genes in vivo in Neurospora.	We have adapted the meiotic recombination hotspot cog of Neurospora crassa for shuffling exogenous DNA, providing a means of generating novel genes in situ from sequences introduced into chromosomes. Genes to be diversified are inserted between the his-3 locus and cog. Diversification crosses are heterozygous both for alleles of the exogenous DNA and for auxotrophic alleles of his-3. Progeny selected for ability to grow without histidine supplementation are enriched for exchange events within the exogenous DNA. Exchange events initiated by cog can propagate past DNA sequences mismatched for more than 370 bp and complete exchanges in patches of matched sequence as short as 24 bp, parameters that make the system suited for use in the directed evolution of genes for protein engineering. Here we demonstrate the system by shuffling human immunoglobulin kappa chain genes and also endoglucanase genes derived from different species of fungi. 
21307835	20110211	J_Vis_Exp	D016428 D059040 	A high throughput screen for biomining cellulase activity from metagenomic libraries.	Cellulose, the most abundant source of organic carbon on the planet, has wide-ranging industrial applications with increasing emphasis on biofuel production (1). Chemical methods to modify or degrade cellulose typically require strong acids and high temperatures. As such, enzymatic methods have become prominent in the bioconversion process. While the identification of active cellulases from bacterial and fungal isolates has been somewhat effective, the vast majority of microbes in nature resist laboratory cultivation. Environmental genomic, also known as metagenomic, screening approaches have great promise in bridging the cultivation gap in the search for novel bioconversion enzymes. Metagenomic screening approaches have successfully recovered novel cellulases from environments as varied as soils (2), buffalo rumen (3) and the termite hind-gut (4) using carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) agar plates stained with congo red dye (based on the method of Teather and Wood (5)). However, the CMC method is limited in throughput, is not quantitative and manifests a low signal to noise ratio (6). Other methods have been reported (7,8) but each use an agar plate-based assay, which is undesirable for high-throughput screening of large insert genomic libraries. Here we present a solution-based screen for cellulase activity using a chromogenic dinitrophenol (DNP)-cellobioside substrate (9). Our library was cloned into the pCC1 copy control fosmid to increase assay sensitivity through copy number induction (10). The method uses one-pot chemistry in 384-well microplates with the final readout provided as an absorbance measurement. This readout is quantitative, sensitive and automated with a throughput of up to 100X 384-well plates per day using a liquid handler and plate reader with attached stacking system.

The enzyme catalyzed a random eliminative cleavage reaction, had an apparent molecular weight of 40,000, and a pl of 4.2. Pectate lyase antisera were produced and used to identify pectate lyase clones in a cDNA expression library. Thirteen of 14 clones identified immunologically cross-hybridized. The identity of the single-copy pectate lyase gene, which we designated pelA, was confirmed in two ways. First, several cDNA clones expressed pectate lyase activity in Escherichia coli. Second, targeted mutation of the gene in A. nidulans resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. pelA encodes a 1,300-nucleotide mRNA that was present in cells grown with polygalacturonic acid as carbon source but absent from cells grown with glucose or acetate as carbon source. Thus, pectate lyase expression is regulated at the level of mRNA accumulation. 
22552805	20120504	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Kinetic studies on the product inhibition of enzymatic lignocellulose hydrolysis.	In order to understand the product inhibition of enzymatic lignocellulose hydrolysis, the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated rice straw was carried out over an enzyme loading range of 2 to 30 FPU/g substrate, and the inhibition of enzymatic hydrolysis was analyzed kinetically based on the reducing sugars produced. It was shown that glucose, xylose, and arabinose were the main reducing sugar components contained in the hydrolysate. The mass ratio of glucose, xylose, and arabinose to the total reducing sugars was almost constant at 52.0%, 29.7% and 18.8%, respectively, in the enzyme loading range. The reducing sugars exerted competitive inhibitory interferences to the enzymatic hydrolysis. Glucose, xylose, and arabinose had a dissociation constant of 1.24, 0.54 and 0.33 g/l, respectively. The inhibitory interferences by reducing sugars were superimposed on the enzymatic hydrolysis. The enzymatic hydrolysis could be improved by the removal of the produced reducing sugars from hydrolysate.

Three cellulases and a beta-glucosidase were purified from the culture filtrate of the thermophilic fungus Thermoascus aurantiacus. The isolated enzymes were all homogeneous on polyacrylamide-disc-gel electrophoresis. Data from chromatography on Bio-Gel P-60 and sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated mol.wts. of 87000 (beta-glucosidase), 78000 (cellulase I), 49000 (cellulase II) and 34000 (cellulase III); the carbohydrate contents of the enzymes were 33.0, 5.5, 2.6 and 1.8% (w/w) respectively. Although the three purified cellulases were active towards filter paper, only cellulases I and III were active towards CM(carboxymethyl)-cellulose. Cellulase I was also active towards yeast glucan. The Km and catalytic-centre-activity values for the enzymes were as follows; 0.52 mumol/ml and 6.5 X 10(4) for beta-glucosidase on p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucoside, 3.9 mg/ml and 6.3 for cellulase I on CM-cellulose, 1.2 mg/ml and 1.1 for cellulase I on yeast glucan, 35.5 mg/ml and 0.34 for cellulase II on filter paper, and 1.9 mg/ml and 33 for cellulase III on CM-cellulose. 
20601723	20100706	Glycobiology	D016428 D013485 	The α-galactosidase type A gene aglA from Aspergillus niger encodes a fully functional α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase.	Two genes in the genome of Aspergillus niger, aglA and aglB, have been assigned to encode for α-d-galactosidases variant A and B. However, analyses of primary and 3D structures based on structural models of these two enzymes revealed significant differences in their active centers suggesting important differences in their specificity for the hydrolyzed carbohydrates. To test this unexpected finding, a large screening of libraries from 42 strains of filamentous fungi succeeded in identifying an enzyme from A. niger CCIM K2 that exhibited both α-galactosidase and α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activities, with the latter activity predominating. The enzyme protein was sequenced, and its amino acid sequence could be unequivocally assigned to the enzyme encoded the aglA gene. Enzyme activity measurements and substrate docking clearly demonstrated the preference of the identified enzyme for α-N-acetyl-d-galactosaminide over α-d-galactoside. Thus, we provide evidence that the α-galactosidase type A gene aglA from A. niger in fact encodes a fully functional α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase using a retaining mechanism.

We have previously engineered a recombinant Pichia pastoris GS115 transformant, MSPGA-7, harboring seven copies of glucoamylase (GA) fused with modified signal peptide. High yield secretion of GA was achieved as an extra copy of SEC4 was integrated to the transformant. To elucidate the physiological role of SEC4, a dominant-negative mutant of SEC4, SEC4(S28N), was overexpressed under the control of alchohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter in P. pastoris strain MSPGA-7 as well as a set of host cells harboring multi-copy of wild type SEC4. We found that SEC4(S28N) mutation in the key guanine nucleotide binding domain reduced guanine nucleotide binding affinity, hence it blocked the transport of vesicles required for targeting and fusion to the plasma membrane. The inhibitory levels of cell growth and GA secretion were correlated with the dosage of SEC4(S28N) gene. In addition, overexpression of SEC4 driven by AOX1 promoter in MSPGA-7 improved the secretory production of GA, but demonstrated the delay of cell growth by increased gene dosage of SEC4. Interestingly, a limited level of Sec4p did not disturb the cell growth. It was because expression of only one copy of SEC4 resulted in delay of cell growth at an early stage while still maintaining high level Sec4p at long-term incubation. Accordingly, as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter was used to substitute AOX1 promoter to drive the SEC4 expression, enhanced GA secretion but not inhibition of cell growth was achieved. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SEC4 is essential for P. pastoris in regulating cell growth and heterologous protein secretion in a dosage-dependent manner.

Purification and some properties of two different 1,4beta-glucan glucanohydrolases from Trichoderma viride.	1. A low-molecular-weight and a high-molecular-weight 1,4beta-glucan glucanohydrolase (Cx enzyme) have been isolated from a commercial cellulase preparation derived from culture filtrates of the fungus Trichoderma viride. 2. The purification method for the isolation of the low-molecular-weight enzyme is a three-step procedure including chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10, chromatography on a dipolar adsorbent (arginine-Sepharose 6 B) and isoelectric focusing. 3. The starting material for the isolation of the high-molecular-weight enzyme was pre-fractionated by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10, by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and by SE-Sephadex chromatography as described previously by us. Further fractionation of this material was achieved by affinity chromatography and repeated isoelectric focusing. 4. Free zone electrophoresis of the low-molecular-weight enzyme indicated a homogeneous protein. The high-molecular-weight enzyme was homogenous in sedimentation equilibrium analysis. 5. The molecular weights of the enzymes were 12 500 and 50 000 +/- 2000 respectively. The former value was determined by chromatography on a calibrated column of Bio-Gel P-100 and the latter value by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. 6. The low-molecular-weight enzyme was isoelectric at pH 4.60 (10 degrees C) and contained 21% carbohydrate. The corresponding values for the high-molecular-weight enzyme were pH 3.39 and 12%. 7. Both enzymes were active in releasing free fibers from filter-paper. The low-molecular-weight enzyme was estimated to be about twice as effective as the high-molecular-weight enzyme in this regard.

The chit42 gene cloned from Metarhizium anisopliae lacks chitin-binding domain (chBD), which plays important roles in binding insoluble chitin. Five kinds of hybrid chitinase Trichoderma transformants were constructed in this study, where the chit42 gene was fused to chBDs derived from plant, bacterial, and insect sources. The transformant Mc4 harboring chBDs from bitter melon (Momordica charantia) displayed the highest chitinase activity among all chBDs. The chitinase activities of Mc4, chit42 Trichoderma transformant Mchit3, and wild-type strain T30 were 44.94, 32.48, and 12.38 U/mL, respectively. The mortality rate of corn borer larvae in Mc4 fermentation liquid treatment increased by 10% and 30% compared with Mchit3 and T30, respectively. The midgut microvilli and goblet cell microvilli of the corn borer larvae exhibited distinct pathological changes after 48 h of feeding in Mc4 treatment. Mc4 also exhibited the strongest antifungal activity against Fusarium verticillioides and Rhizoctonia solani.

D016428 D013485 	The effects of sequential inoculation of mixed rumen protozoa on the degradation of orchard grass cell walls by anaerobic fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus 543.	The effects of protozoa on the degradation of plant cell walls (CW) during different growth stages of the fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus have been investigated. Since fungi show a marked lag in their in vitro cultures and many protozoa rapidly die during a prolonged incubation time, the effects of protozoa may vary according to the growth phase of the fungi. Therefore, the approach adopted was (i) to inoculate CW with fungus monoculture, (ii) to inoculate CW with fungus-protozoa coculture, or (iii) to sequentially inoculate fungal cultures that had been grown in CW for 24 (initial stage of growth), 48, and 72 h (late stage of growth) with mixed protozoa. When a fungus was associated with protozoa, a growth phase dependent effect was observed. Ruminal protozoa adversely affected the growth and activity when introduced in the initial growth stage of A. mucronatus, but a synergetic interaction was detected when added to late growth stage cultures. Although there is no immediate explanation for these results, the data suggested that protozoa can engulf the fungal zoospores, which are in ruminal fluids and (or) attached to small feed particles, but cannot engulf the fungal thallus that is tightly attached to feed particles by a rhizoidal system. Our data indicated that the protozoa did not influence cellulolysis by the fungi in exponential and (or) stationary phase, but they had a marked inhibitory effect on fungi that were in lag phase. Inhibition during lag phase could result from the protozoal predation of fungal zoospores that had failed to attach to substrates.

The protoplast fusion of two spontaneous mutants of T. lanuginosus, characterized as asporulating and resistant to 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), resulted in sporulating, 2DG sensitive heterokaryotic fusants. A recombinant haploid strain F64fB developed there from produced alpha-amylase constitutively in glucose-containing medium. Constitutive alpha-amylase-hyperproducing mutant (III8) obtained after cyclic mutagenesis and screening yielded approximately 20 fold more alpha-amylase in a glycerol-containing medium than the wild strain.

Segregants resulting from the backcross of exo-1 to the wild-type strain from which it derived are altered in the ratio of galactosamine to glucosamine in hydrolysates of isolated cell walls. Conidial cell walls exhibit a marked decrease in the amount of galactosamine in both exo-1 and exo-1(+) strains. Increased levels (approximately sevenfold) of amylase are found in conidia of exo-1, as compared with those of exo-1(+).

The interaction of cationic surfactants, n-alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromides (CnTAB, n = 12 and 14), with cellulase from Aspergillus niger has been investigated at 25 degrees C and various pH, using CnTAB-membrane selective electrodes as a simple, fast, cheap and accurate technique and fluorescence spectroscopy. The regions of C1 (the surfactant concentration at which binding is initiated) and C2 (enzyme saturated by surfactant) were determined using potentiometric measurements. The obtained binding isotherms have been analyzed using Scatchard plot and binding capacity concept. The results were interpreted on the basis of nature of forces which interfered in the interaction and represent two binding sets system for all of the studied conditions. Hill equation parameters have been estimated and used for calculation of intrinsic Gibbs free energy that decreases with extension of binding. The effect of CnTAB binding on cellulase intrinsic fluorescence spectra was also examined. A biphasic behavior was observed for quenching process of endoglucanase by CnTAB that confirms the results of binding studies correspond to the existence of two types of binding sites for CnTAB on cellulase. 
19204807	20090211	Evol._Bioinform._Online	D016428 	Comparative evolutionary histories of the fungal chitinase gene family reveal non-random size expansions and contractions due to adaptive natural selection.	Gene duplication and loss play an important role in the evolution of novel functions and for shaping an organism's gene content. Recently, it was suggested that stress-related genes frequently are exposed to duplications and losses, while growth-related genes show selection against change in copy number. The fungal chitinase gene family constitutes an interesting case study of gene duplication and loss, as their biological roles include growth and development as well as more stress-responsive functions. We used genome sequence data to analyze the size of the chitinase gene family in different fungal taxa, which range from 1 in Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe to 20 in Hypocrea jecorina and Emericella nidulans, and to infer their phylogenetic relationships. Novel chitinase subgroups are identified and their phylogenetic relationships with previously known chitinases are discussed. We also employ a stochastic birth and death model to show that the fungal chitinase gene family indeed evolves non-randomly, and we identify six fungal lineages where larger-than-expected expansions (Pezizomycotina, H. jecorina, Gibberella zeae, Uncinocarpus reesii, E. nidulans and Rhizopus oryzae), and two contractions (Coccidioides immitis and S. pombe) potentially indicate the action of adaptive natural selection. The results indicate that antagonistic fungal-fungal interactions are an important process for soil borne ascomycetes, but not for fungal species that are pathogenic in humans. Unicellular growth is correlated with a reduction of chitinase gene copy numbers which emphasizes the requirement of the combined action of several chitinases for filamentous growth. 
10945680	20000817	Carbohydr._Res.	D016428 D013485 	Quantification of the amount of galacturonic acid residues in blocksequences in pectin homogalacturonan by enzymatic fingerprinting with exo- and endo-polygalacturonase II from Aspergillus niger.	A method to determine the amount of galacturonic acid in blocksequence (BS) in pectin homogalacturonan (HG) is described. The method is based on a combination of endopolygalacturonase II (endo-PG II) and exopolygalacturonase (exo-PG) digestion followed by quantification of the liberated galacturonic acid monomer. The amount of monomers released is directly related to the amount of non-esterified galacturonic acid units located between two other non-esterified galacturonic acids units on the HG chain. The amount released for exo-PG digestion only corresponds to the BS located at the non-reducing end of the polymer. The difference between total- and exo-BS was calculated to be the amount of endo-BS located either within or on the reducing end of the HG. Three series of model pectins obtained by de-esterification of a high-ester pectin with either plant pectin methyl-esterase (p-PME, P-series), fungal pectin methyl-esterase (f-PME, F-series) and chemical de-esterification using base (B-series) were analysed and compared with a fully de-esterified pectic acid sample obtained from the same raw material. Clear differences for the increase of the amounts of blocksequence could be seen between de-esterification of the P- and F-series samples supporting a blockwise and a homogenous de-esterification mechanism, respectively. f-PME and base treatment showed only minor differences in the increase of galacturonic acid units in BS, despite differences seen in their methyl-esterification pattern. Differences between the amounts of galacturonic acid located in exo- and endo-BS, provided evidence for the need of a certain start side or blocklength for p-PME to de-esterify blockwise. 
20642838	20100721	BMC_Genomics	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis of Trichoderma reesei strains with enhanced cellulase production properties.	Trichoderma reesei is the main industrial producer of cellulases and hemicellulases that are used to depolymerize biomass in a variety of biotechnical applications. Many of the production strains currently in use have been generated by classical mutagenesis. In this study we characterized genomic alterations in high-producing mutants of T. reesei by high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Our aim was to obtain genome-wide information which could be utilized for better understanding of the mechanisms underlying efficient cellulase production, and would enable targeted genetic engineering for improved production of proteins in general. We carried out an aCGH analysis of four high-producing strains (QM9123, QM9414, NG14 and Rut-C30) using the natural isolate QM6a as a reference. In QM9123 and QM9414 we detected a total of 44 previously undocumented mutation sites including deletions, chromosomal translocation breakpoints and single nucleotide mutations. In NG14 and Rut-C30 we detected 126 mutations of which 17 were new mutations not documented previously. Among these new mutations are the first chromosomal translocation breakpoints identified in NG14 and Rut-C30. We studied the effects of two deletions identified in Rut-C30 (a deletion of 85 kb in the scaffold 15 and a deletion in a gene encoding a transcription factor) on cellulase production by constructing knock-out strains in the QM6a background. Neither the 85 kb deletion nor the deletion of the transcription factor affected cellulase production. aCGH analysis identified dozens of mutations in each strain analyzed. The resolution was at the level of single nucleotide mutation. High-density aCGH is a powerful tool for genome-wide analysis of organisms with small genomes e.g. fungi, especially in studies where a large set of interesting strains is analyzed. 
18279338	20080219	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, molecular characterization and heterologous expression of AMY1, an alpha-amylase gene from Cryptococcus flavus.	A Cryptococcus flavus gene (AMY1) encoding an extracellular alpha-amylase has been cloned. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA revealed an ORF of 1896 bp encoding for a 631 amino acid polypeptide with high sequence identity with a homologous protein isolated from Cryptococcus sp. S-2. The presence of four conserved signature regions, (I) (144)DVVVNH(149), (II) (235)GLRIDSLQQ(243), (III) (263)GEVFN(267), (IV) (327)FLENQD(332), placed the enzyme in the GH13 alpha-amylase family. Furthermore, sequence comparison suggests that the C. flavusalpha-amylase has a C-terminal starch-binding domain characteristic of the CBM20 family. AMY1 was successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The time course of amylase secretion in S. cerevisiae resulted in a maximal extracellular amylolytic activity (3.93 U mL(-1)) at 60 h of incubation. The recombinant protein had an apparent molecular mass similar to the native enzyme (c. 67 kDa), part of which was due to N-glycosylation. 
9076736	19970301	Mol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae a short amino acid sequence facilitates excretion in the growth medium of periplasmic proteins.	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the cell wall is a barrier to excretion of proteins in the growth medium. Although small proteins are more easily released than bigger ones, other factors besides molecular sieving may play a role in partitioning of periplasmic proteins. By using several complementary approaches including enzyme-activity assays, quantitative immunoblotting on subcellular fractions and growth media, as well as a novel approach involving the use of flow cytometry and specific antibodies, we show that residues 1-8 of mature glucoamylase greatly enhance excretion of both glucoamylase and beta-galactosidase in vivo and facilitate extraction of periplasmic proteins in vitro. Immunological data obtained by flow cytometry on whole cells indicate that this amino acid sequence increases the fraction of enzyme reaching the outer cell-wall layers. This amino acid sequence may define a novel type of topogenic sequence, facilitating the crossing of the yeast cell wall in vivo and facilitating extraction of periplasmic proteins by non-disruptive means in vitro.

The fungal cell wall is a complex structure composed of chitin, glucans and other polymers, and there is evidence of extensive cross-linking between these components. The wall structure is highly dynamic, changing constantly during cell division, growth and morphogenesis. Hydrolytic enzymes, closely associated with the cell wall, have been implicated in the maintenance of wall plasticity and may have roles during branching and cross-linking of polymers. Most fungal cell wall hydrolases identified to date have chitinase or glucanase activity and this short article reviews the apparent functions of these enzymes in unicellular and filamentous fungi, and the mechanisms that regulate enzyme activity in yeasts. 
23618278	20130427	Carbohydr_Polym	D016428 	Aged-look vat dyed cotton with anti-bacterial/anti-fungal properties by treatment with nano clay and enzymes.	In this research, nanotechnology as a route to functional finishing of textiles was used along with bio-finishing to enhance the cotton fabrics performance. For this purpose, quaternary modified montmorillonite and common enzymes such as cellulase, laccase and their mixture were applied on vat dyed cotton fabric. Characteristic analysis of the treated samples and the dispersed nano clays in the effluent of the treatment was performed by various analyzing methods. The nano/bio-finishing is believed to impart antibacterial and antifungal activities with simultaneously higher lightness, advanced softness and handle properties into cotton fabrics. Moreover, cotton fabrics were proved to have no adverse effects (low toxicity) on human dermal fibroblasts. Findings suggest the potential of the proposed method in reducing the risk of microorganism for textile applications and imparting better handle and appearance properties. 
21876370	20110831	J._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification, and biochemical and biophysical characterization of cellobiohydrolase I from Trichoderma harzianum IOC 3844.	Because of its elevated cellulolytic activity, the filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum has a considerable potential in biomass hydrolysis applications. Trichoderma harzianum cellobiohydrolase I (ThCBHI), an exoglucanase, is an important enzyme in the process of cellulose degradation. Here, we report an easy single-step ion-exchange chromatographic method for purification of ThCBHI and its initial biophysical and biochemical characterization. The ThCBHI produced by induction with microcrystalline cellulose under submerged fermentation was purified on DEAE-Sephadex A-50 media and its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The ThCBHI biochemical characterization showed that the protein has a molecular mass of 66 kDa and pI of 5.23. As confirmed by smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS), both full-length ThCBHI and its catalytic core domain (CCD) obtained by digestion with papain are monomeric in solution. Secondary structure analysis of ThCBHI by circular dichroism revealed alpha- helices and beta-strands contents in the 28% and 38% range, respectively. The intrinsic fluorescence emission maximum of 337 nm was accounted for as different degrees of exposure of ThCBHI tryptophan residues to water. Moreover, ThCBHI displayed maximum activity at pH 5.0 and temperature of 50 degrees C with specific activities against Avicel and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside of 1.25 U/mg and 1.53 U/mg, respectively. 
9620276	19980610	Plant_Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	A maize pectin methylesterase-like gene, ZmC5, specifically expressed in pollen.	Pectin methylesterase (PME) is responsible for the demethylation of pectin prior to pectin's degradation by the combined activities of polygalacturonase and pectate lyase. We have differentially screened a maize pollen cDNA library to detect cDNA clones whose genes are specifically expressed in pollen. One group of clones resulting from this screen showed similarity (between 18% and 41% identity) with plant and fungal PMEs. The full-length clone from this group, ZmC5, identifies a small gene family (at least 2 members) when used as a probe on genomic Southern blots. Northern analysis reveals that the ZmC5 transcript is expressed specifically in late pollen development. This tissue-specific gene expression programme is further confirmed in transgenic tobacco plants harbouring ZmC5 promoter/GUS chimeric gene constructs. 
19899079	20091110	Proteomics	D016428 D013485 	The effects of extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate on the tobacco proteome.	Extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (eATP) is emerging as an important plant signalling compound capable of mobilising intracellular second messengers such as Ca(2+), nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species. However, the downstream molecular targets and the spectrum of physiological processes that eATP regulates are largely unknown. We used exogenous ATP and a non-hydrolysable analogue as probes to identify the molecular and physiological effects of eATP-mediated signalling in tobacco. 2-DE coupled with MS/MS analysis revealed differential protein expression in response to perturbation of eATP signalling. These proteins are in several functional classes that included photosynthesis, mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and defence against oxidative stress, but the biggest response was in the pathogen defence-related proteins. Consistent with this, impairment of eATP signalling induced resistance against the bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. In addition, disease resistance activated by a fungal pathogen elicitor (xylanase from Trichoderma viride) was concomitant with eATP depletion. These results reveal several previously unknown putative molecular targets of eATP signalling, which pinpoint eATP as an important hub at which regulatory signals of some major primary metabolic pathways and defence responses are integrated. 
22510825	20120419	Mem._Inst._Oswaldo_Cruz	D016428 D013485 	Distinct chitinases are expressed during various growth phases of the human pathogen Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.	The aim of this work was the partial purification and subsequent evaluation of chitinase expression during the various growth phases of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Initially, PbCTS1r was expressed as a recombinant protein and displayed enzymatic activity against 4-MU-[N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)]3 and 4-MU-(GlcNAc)2. Two proteins, 45 kDa and 39 kDa in size, were partially purified from P. brasiliensis yeast crude extract using cation-exchange chromatography coupled with HPLC and were characterised as PbCTS1 and PbCTS2, respectively. Anti-PbCTS1r antibody recognised two proteins in the crude extracts of yeast and the transitional stage between mycelial and yeast phases. In crude extracts of mycelium, only the 45 kDa protein was detected. However, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction led to the detection of small quantities of Pbcts2 transcript in the mycelial phase. In the yeast cell wall extract, only the 39 kDa protein was detected. Moreover, both proteins were secreted by the yeast parasitic phase, suggesting that these proteins participate in the modulation of the fungal environment. Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted PbCTS1 and PbCTS2 proteins indicated that they code for distinct chitinases in P. brasiliensis. During evolution, P. brasiliensis could have acquired the paralogues Pbcts1 and Pbcts2 for growth and survival in diverse environments in both saprophytic and parasitic phases. 
11114249	20001215	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Structural basis for enantiomer binding and separation of a common beta-blocker: crystal structure of cellobiohydrolase Cel7A with bound (S)-propranolol at 1.9 A resolution.	Cellobiohydrolase Cel7A (previously called CBH 1), the major cellulase produced by the mould fungus Trichoderma reesei, has been successfully exploited as a chiral selector for separation of stereo-isomers of some important pharmaceutical compounds, e.g. adrenergic beta-blockers. Previous investigations, including experiments with catalytically deficient mutants of Cel7A, point unanimously to the active site as being responsible for discrimination of enantiomers. In this work the structural basis for enantioselectivity of basic drugs by Cel7A has been studied by X-ray crystallography. The catalytic domain of Cel7A was co-crystallised with the (S)-enantiomer of a common beta-blocker, propranolol, at pH 7, and the structure of the complex was determined and refined at 1. 9 A resolution. Indeed, (S)-propranolol binds at the active site, in glucosyl-binding subsites -1/+1. The catalytic residues Glu212 and Glu217 make tight salt links with the secondary amino group of (S)-propranolol. The oxygen atom attached to the chiral centre of (S)-propranolol forms hydrogen bonds to the nucleophile Glu212 O(epsilon1) and to Gln175 N(epsilon2), whereas the aromatic naphthyl moiety stacks with the indole ring of Trp376 in site +1. The bidentate charge interaction with the catalytic glutamate residues is apparently crucial, since no enantioselectivity has been obtained with the catalytically deficient mutants E212Q and E217Q. Activity inhibition experiments with wild-type Cel7A were performed in conditions close to those used for crystallisation. Competitive inhibition constants for (R)- and (S)-propranolol were determined at 220 microM and 44 microM, respectively, corresponding to binding free energies of 20 kJ/mol and 24 kJ/mol, respectively. The K(i) value for (R)-propranolol was 57-fold lower than the highest concentration, 12.5 mM, used in co-crystallisation experiments. Still several attempts to obtain a complex with the (R)-enantiomer have failed. By using cellobiose as a selective competing ligand, the retention of the enantiomers of propranolol on the chiral stationary phase (CSP) based on Cel7A mutant D214N were resolved into enantioselective and non- selective binding. The enantioselective binding was weaker for both enantiomers on D214N-CSP than on wild-type-CSP.

Plants and Resistance to Late Blight Infection Caused by Phytophthora infestans.	Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) plants were sprayed with aqueous solutions of isomers of aminobutyric acid and were either analyzed for the accumulation of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins or challenged with the late blight fungal agent Phytophthora infestans. The [beta] isomer of aminobutyric acid induced the accumulation of high levels of three proteins: P14a, [beta]-1,3 glucanase, and chitinase. These proteins either did not accumulate or accumulated to a much lower level in [alpha]- or [gamma]-aminobutyric acid-treated plants. Plants pretreated with [alpha]-, [beta]-, and [gamma]-aminobutyric acid were protected up to 11 d to an extent of 35, 92, and 6%, respectively, against a challenge infection with P. infestans. Protection by [beta]-aminobutyric acid was afforded against the blight even when the chemical was applied 1 d postinoculation. Examination of ethylene evolution showed that [alpha]-aminobutyric acid induced the production of 3-fold higher levels of ethylene compared with [beta]-aminobutyric acid, whereas [gamma]-aminobutyric acid induced no ethylene production. In addition, silver thiosulfate, a potent inhibitor of ethylene action, did not abolish the resistance induced by [beta]-aminobutyric acid. The results are consistent with the possibility that [beta]-aminobutyric acid protects tomato foliage against the late blight disease by a mechanism that is not mediated by ethylene and that PR proteins can be involved in induced resistance. 
20702089	20100813	Bioresour._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Factors influencing cellulosome activity in consolidated bioprocessing of cellulosic ethanol.	The cellulosome, a multi-subunit protein complex catalyzing cellulose degradation in cellulolytic Clostridium thermocellum, plays a crucial role in Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP) of lignocellulose into ethanol. Here, activity of cellulosome was tested under varying concentrations of chemical compounds derived from lignocellulose pretreatment and fermentation. We found that, firstly, the cellulolytic activity of cellulosome was actually promoted by formate, acetate and lactate; secondly, cellulosome was tolerant up to 5mM furfural, 50mM p-hydroxybenzoic acid and 1mM catechol. Furthermore, the cellulosome exhibited higher ethanol tolerance and thermostability than commercialized fungal (Trichoderma reesei) cellulase. To probe the implication of these unique enzyme-features, C. thermocellum JYT01 was cultured under conditions optimal for cellulosome activity. This CBP system yielded 491 mM ethanol, the highest level reported thus far for C. thermocellum monocultures. These findings demonstrate the potential advantages of bacterial cellulosome, and provide a novel strategy for design, selection and optimization of the cellulosome-ethanologen partnership. 
11966919	20020423	J._Appl._Microbiol.	D023362 D016428 D013485 	Evolution of extracellular enzyme activities during manure composting.	The objectives of this work were to determine the extracellular enzyme profiles during composting, relate the activities of these enzymes to the changes in microbial population and compare the enzyme profiles between two manures. API ZYM assay was used to monitor the activities of 19 extracellular enzymes during poultry and pig manure composting. Results showed an overall increase in diversity and relative abundance of enzymes present. The relative abundance and activities of enzymes were higher in poultry manure than in pig manure. Among the 19 enzymes tested, esterase, valine amino-peptidase and alpha-galactosidase were the most abundant enzymes in poultry manure, whereas it was N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase for the pig manure. A number of these enzymes correlated with change in numbers of different microbial groups during composting. The composting process represented a combined activity of a wide succession of environments, as one enzyme/microbial group overlapped the other and each emerged gradually due to the continual change in temperature and progressive breakdown of complex compounds to simpler ones. The results presented here show the applicability of the API ZYM test not only in monitoring the quantitative and qualitative fluctuation of the available substrate during composting, but also in revealing differences in composts and compost maturity.

The map position of three 1,3-beta-glucanase-encoding genes in S. cerevisiae has been determined following conventional meiotic and mitotic mapping combined with recombinant DNA techniques. EXG1, EXG2 and SSG1 were localized to chromosomes XII, IV and XV, respectively, by hybridizing the cloned genes to Southern blots of chromosomes separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, in conjunction with the rad52-1-dependent chromosome-loss mapping technique. Meiotic tetrad analyses further localized the EXG1 gene 6.1 centimorgans centromere-proximal to CDC25 on the right arm of chromosome XII. EXG2 was positioned between LYS4 and GCN2 on the right arm of chromosome IV, at distances of 6.2 centimorgans from LYS4 and 4.9 centimorgans from GCN2. Finally, the SSG1 locus mapped on the right arm of chromosome XV, about 8.2 centimorgans to the centromere-proximal side of HIS3.

Isolates of Leptosphaeria maculans were analyzed for their genetic relatedness based on DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), employing as Southern hybridization probes a combination of heat shock responsive genes (hsp70 and hsp80 from Neurospora crassa), the cutinase gene of Magnaporthe grisea, and cloned genomic DNA sequences from a virulent strain. Southern hybridization analysis revealed a high frequency of DNA polymorphism. Restriction fragments generated by each enzyme-probe combination resulted in distinct banding patterns, clearly separating the isolates into two groups. The cutinase gene probe did not reveal any polymorphisms. Although the majority of the probes used displayed RFLP profiles unique to each group, a nonaggressive isolate, LmA, showed additional genetic characteristics in common with the virulent pathotype.

Six actinomycetes, CAI-13, CAI-85, CAI-93, CAI-140, CAI-155 and KAI-180, isolated from six different herbal vermi-composts were characterized for in vitro plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties and further evaluated in the field for PGP activity in rice. Of the six actinomycetes, CAI-13, CAI-85, CAI-93, CAI-140 and CAI-155 produced siderophores; CAI-13, CAI-93, CAI-155 and KAI-180 produced chitinase; CAI-13, CAI-140, CAI-155 and KAI-180 produced lipase; CAI-13, CAI-93, CAI-155 and KAI-180 produced protease; and CAI-13, CAI-85, CAI-140 and CAI-155 produced ß-1-3-glucanase whereas all the six actinomycetes produced cellulase, hydrocyanic acid and indole acetic acid (IAA). The actinomycetes were able to grow in NaCl concentrations of up to 8%, at pH values between 7 and 11, temperatures between 20 and 40 °C and compatible with fungicide bavistin at field application levels. In the rice field, the actinomycetes significantly enhanced tiller numbers, panicle numbers, filled grain numbers and weight, stover yield, grain yield, total dry matter, root length, volume and dry weight over the un-inoculated control. In the rhizosphere, the actinomycetes also significantly enhanced total nitrogen, available phosphorous, % organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and dehydrogenase activity over the un-inoculated control. Sequences of 16S rDNA gene of the actinomycetes matched with different Streptomyces species in BLAST analysis. Of the six actinomycetes, CAI-85 and CAI-93 were found superior over other actinomycetes in terms of PGP properties, root development and crop productivity. qRT-PCR analysis on selected plant growth promoting genes of actinomycetes revealed the up-regulation of IAA genes only in CAI-85 and CAI-93.

Pretreatment is a necessary step in the biomass-to-ethanol conversion process. The side stream of the pretreatment step is the liquid fraction, also referred to as the hydrolyzate, which arises after the separation of the pretreated solid and is composed of valuable carbohydrates along with compounds that are potentially toxic to microbes (mainly furfural, acetic acid, and formic acid). The aim of our study was to utilize the liquid fraction from steam-exploded wheat straw as a carbon source for cellulase production by Trichoderma reesei RUT C30. Results showed that without detoxification, the fungus failed to utilize any dilution of the hydrolyzate; however, after a two-step detoxification process, it was able to grow on a fourfold dilution of the treated liquid fraction. Supplementation of the fourfold-diluted, treated liquid fraction with washed pretreated wheat straw or ground wheat grain led to enhanced cellulase (filter paper) activity. Produced enzymes were tested in hydrolysis of washed pretreated wheat straw. Supplementation with ground wheat grain provided a more efficient enzyme mixture for the hydrolysis by means of the near-doubled β-glucosidase activity obtained.

A strain of starch-assimilating yeast, Saccharomycopsis capsularis, isolated from Indian cereal-based fermented foods, produced significant levels of extracellular alpha-amylase and glucoamylase. The enzymes reached their peak activities during the stationary phase at the end of the 5th and 4th day of cultivation, respectively. The amylase yields were maximized by a proper choice of carbon and nitrogen sources, starting pH of the culture medium and growth temperature. High activities of the enzymes were obtained through inexpensive agricultural commodities, such as wheat bran and corn meal as carbon sources, and defatted soybean meal and peanut meal as nitrogen sources. A temperature of 28-32 degrees C and an initial pH of 4.5-5.0 were optimum. The crude amylase mixture could liquefy and saccharify a 1% starch solution completely in 24 h at 50 degrees C. 
23409143	20130215	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 	Overexpression of a fungal β-mannanase from Bispora sp. MEY-1 in maize seeds and enzyme characterization.	Mannans and heteromannans are widespread in plants cell walls and are well-known as anti-nutritional factors in animal feed. To remove these factors, it is common practice to incorporate endo-β-mannanase into feed for efficient nutrition absorption. The objective of this study was to overexpress a β-mannanase gene directly in maize, the main ingredient of animal feed, to simplify the process of feed production. The man5A gene encoding an excellent β-mannanase from acidophilic Bispora sp. MEY-1 was selected for heterologous overexpression. Expression of the modified gene (man5As) was driven by the embryo-specific promoter ZM-leg1A, and the transgene was transferred to three generations by backcrossing with commercial inbred Zheng58. Its exogenous integration into the maize embryonic genome and tissue specific expression in seeds were confirmed by PCR and Southern blot and Western blot analysis, respectively. Transgenic plants at BC3 generation showed agronomic traits statistically similar to Zheng58 except for less plant height (154.0 cm vs 158.3 cm). The expression level of MAN5AS reached up to 26,860 units per kilogram of maize seeds. Compared with its counterpart produced in Pichia pastoris, seed-derived MAN5AS had higher temperature optimum (90°C), and remained more β-mannanase activities after pelleting at 80°C, 100°C or 120°C. This study shows the genetically stable overexpression of a fungal β-mannanase in maize and offers an effective and economic approach for transgene containment in maize for direct utilization without any purification or supplementation procedures. 
23512640	20130321	J._Sci._Food_Agric.	D016428 D013485 	Enhanced thermostability of a mesophilic xylanase by N-terminal replacement designed by molecular dynamics simulation.	Xylanases have attracted much attention owing to their potential applications. The applicability of xylanases, however, was bottlenecked by their low stabilities at high temperature or extreme pH. The purpose of this work was to enhance the thermostability of a mesophilic xylanase by N-terminal replacement. The thermostability of AoXyn11, a mesophilic family 11 xylanase from Aspergillus oryzae, was enhanced by replacing its N-terminal segment with the corresponding one of EvXyn11(TS) , a hyperthermotolerant family 11 xylanase. A hybrid xylanase with high thermostability, NhXyn11⁵⁷, was predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. An NhXyn11⁵⁷-encoding gene, Nhxyn11⁵⁷, was then constructed as designed theoretically, and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. The temperature optimum of recombinant NhXyn11⁵⁷ (re-NhXyn11⁵⁷) was 75 °C, much higher than that of re-AoXyn11. Both xylanases were thermostable at 65 and 40 °C, respectively. Additionally, the pH optimum and stability of re-NhXyn11⁵⁷ were 5.5 and at a range of 4.0-8.5. Its activity was not significantly affected by metal ions tested and EDTA, but strongly inhibited by Mn²⁺ and Ag⁺. This work obviously enhanced the thermostability of a mesophilic xylanase, making re-NhXyn11⁵⁷ a promising candidate for industrial processes. It also provided an effective technical strategy for improving thermostabilities of other mesophilic enzymes.

The enzyme is a glycoprotein containing 9.8% saccharide, pI of 8.3 and molar mass of 75 kDa (SDS-PAGE) or 60 kDa (Sepharose 6B). Optima of pH and temperature with starch or maltose as substrates were 5.5/70 degrees C and 5.5/65 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was stable for 1 h at 55 degrees C and for about 8 d at 4 degrees C, either at pH 7.0 or pH 5.5. Starch, amylopectin, glycogen, amylose and maltose were the substrates preferentially hydrolyzed. The activity was activated by 1 mmol/L Mg2+ (27%), Zn2+ (21%), Ba2+ (8%) and Mn2+ (5%). Km and vlim values for starch and maltose were 0.21 g/L, 62 U/mg protein and 3.9 g/L, 9.0 U/mg protein, respectively. Glucoamylase activity was only slightly inhibited by glucose up to a 1 mol/L concentration.

The water-solubility of 7-propionyldocetaxel 3''-O-β-D-glucopyranoside was 52-fold higher than that of docetaxel. 7-Propionyldocetaxel 3''-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and 7-propionyldocetaxel 3''-O-β-D-xylopyranoside were effectively hydrolyzed by the relevant enzyme(s) of human cancer cells to release docetaxel, whereas 7-propionyldocetaxel 3''-O-β-D-galactopyranoside was relatively resistant under similar conditions. 7-Propionyldocetaxel 3''-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and 7-propionyldocetaxel 3''-O-β-D-xylopyranoside showed in vitro cytotoxic activity against human cancer cells, whereas 7-propionyldocetaxel 3''-O-β-D-galactopyranoside exerted low cytotoxicity. 
7765235	19940815	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Evaluation of molecular and genetic approaches to generate glucoamylase overproducing strains of Aspergillus niger.	To evaluate the possibility of improving glucoamylase (GLA) production in Aspergillus niger strains carrying multiple copies of the GLA encoding gene (glaA), additional glaA copies were introduced either by genetic recombination or retransformation. For strains to be used in such experiments a genetic analysis was first carried out. The results of this analysis clearly revealed that in each transformant integration had occurred at a chromosome corresponding to a single linkage group (LG). The GLA production per gene copy showed considerable variation in these strains, indicating a clear effect of the site of integration on gene expression. Introduction of additional gene copies by genetic recombination experiments was carried out for different combinations of strains, carrying glaA copies in different chromosomes. The introduction of additional glaA gene copies by genetic recombination did not result in a considerable increase in GLA production compared to the parental strains. In some strains recombination resulted in genetic instability, observed by the frequent loss of glaA copies. Also, retransformation of multi-copy glaA strains did not result in an increase in GLA production. In several strains even a decrease in GLA production was found after retransformation. Southern analysis of these transformants suggested that newly introduced gene copies were heavily rearranged, which partly explains why GLA production was not increased. Further analysis of one such transformant provided evidence that the overexpression of the glaA gene is limited by the amount of trans-acting regulatory protein(s) available.

Present methods to determine the moulds comprise counting of spores or determination of viable moulds which give imprecise measures of total mould cell biomass. Analysis of ergosterol and β-glucan as markers of mould cell biomass is expensive and cumbersome. To evaluate if airborne enzyme activity was related to mould in buildings air samples were taken using an impinger technique or cellulose filters in 386 rooms in 141 buildings. The samples were analysed for the activity of N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAHA) and expressed as enzyme units per m(3) (EU per m(3)). The highest value found in a building was used for the classification of the building and was related to the results from the subsequent technical inspection. In buildings without mould damage, the NAHA activity was generally below 20 EU per m(3). In buildings with mould damage, almost all the buildings had activities above 20 EU per m(3) (specificity 85%). At 30 EU per m(3) the specificity was 100%. Measurements of airborne enzyme activity have a high sensitivity and specificity to identify buildings with mould problems. The method can be used in the investigations of building related symptoms or for home exposure characteristics when investigating diseases such as asthma that can be related to mould exposure.

A genetic screen was devised to identify genes important for spindle pole body (SPB) and/or microtubule functions. Four mutants defective in both nuclear fusion (karyogamy) and chromosome maintenance were isolated; these mutants termed cik (for chromosome instability and karyogamy) define three complementation groups. The CIK1 gene was cloned and characterized. Sequence analysis of the CIK1 gene predicts that the CIK1 protein is 594 amino acids in length and possesses a central 300-amino-acid coiled-coil domain. Two different CIK1-beta-galactosidase fusions localize to the SPB region in vegetative cells, and antibodies against the authentic protein detect CIK1 in the SPB region of alpha-factor-treated cells. Evaluation of cells deleted for CIK1 (cik1-delta) indicates that CIK1 is important for the formation or maintenance of a spindle apparatus. Longer and slightly more microtubule bundles are visible in cik1-delta strains than in wild type. Thus, CIK1 encodes a SPB-associated component that is important for proper organization of microtubule arrays and the establishment of a spindle during vegetative growth. Furthermore, the CIK1 gene is essential for karyogamy, and the level of the CIK1 protein at the SPB appears to be dramatically induced by alpha-factor treatment. These results indicate that molecular changes occur at the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) as the yeast cell prepares for karyogamy and imply that specialization of the MTOC or its associated microtubules occurs in preparation for particular microtubule functions in the yeast life cycle.

Jatropha curcas is a major biodiesel crop. Large amount of deoiled cake is generated as by-product during biodiesel production from its seeds. Deoiled J. curcas seed cake was assessed as substrate for the production of xylanase from thermophilic fungus Scytalidium thermophilum by solid-state fermentation. The seed cake was efficiently utilized by S. thermophilum for its growth during which it produced good amount of heat stable extracellular xylanase. The solid-state fermentation conditions were optimized for maximum xylanase production. Under the optimized conditions viz. deoiled seed cake supplemented with 1% oat-spelt xylan, adjusted to pH 9.0, moisture content 1:3 w/v, inoculated with 1×10(6) spores per 5 g cake and incubated at 45 °C, 1455 U xylanase/g deoiled seed cake was obtained. The xylanase was useful in biobleaching of paper pulp. Solid-state fermentation of deoiled cake appears a potentially viable approach for its effective utilization.

In in vitro batch fermentations, both alkali-extractable corn arabinoxylan (CAX) and its xylanase-hydrolyzate (CH) were utilized by human fecal microbiota and produced similar short chain fatty acid (SCFA) contents and desirable long fermentation profiles with low initial gas production. Fortification of these arabinoxylans into processed foods would contribute desirable dietary fiber benefits to humans. Heat and pH stability, as well as viscosity behavior of CAX and CH were investigated. Size exclusion chromatography was used to analyze the molecular size distribution after treatment at different pH's and heating temperatures for different time periods. Treated under boiling and pressure cooking conditions at pH 3, CAX was degraded to a smaller molecular size, whereas the molecular size of the CH showed only a minor decrease. CAX and CH were mostly stable at neutral pH, except when CAX was treated under pressure for 60 min that slightly lowered molecular size. At 37 °C, neither CAX nor CH was adversely affected by treatment at low or neutral pH. The viscosities of solutions containing 5% and 10% of CAX were 48.7 and 637.0 mPa.s, respectively that were higher than those of solutions containing 5% and 10% of its hydrolyzate at shear rate 1 s⁻¹. The CAX solutions showed Newtonian flow behavior, whereas shear-thinning behavior was observed in CH solutions. In conclusion, the hydrolyzate of CAX has potential to be used in high fiber drinks due to its favorable fermentation properties, higher pH and heat stability, lower and shear-thinning viscosity, and lighter color than the native CAX. Arabinoxylan extracted by an alkali from corn bran is a soluble fiber with a desirable low initial and extended fermentation property. Corn arabinoxylan hydrolyzate using an endoxylanase was much more stable at different levels of acidity and heat than the native arabinoxylan, and showed lower solution viscosity and shear-thinning property that indicates its potential as an alternative functional dietary fiber for the beverage industry.

An O-glycosylated mannoprotein, after its incorporation into the wall, showed an increase in its molecular weight, due at least to its association with N-glycosidic sugar chain(s). This was shown by rendering the material soluble after partial degradation of the wall structure. At present it is unknown whether this phenomenon is due to an additional transglycosylation process or whether the partial degradation of the wall solubilizes a supramolecular structure formed between the original O-glycosylated protein which becomes linked either directly or indirectly through a protein to the N-sugar chain(s).

Crystalline cross-linked xylose isomerase (CLXI, EC 5.3.1.5) and xylanase (CLX, EC 3.2.1.8) were studied in a packed-bed reactor for simultaneous catalytic reaction and separation of substrates from reaction products. Streptomyces rubiginosus xylose isomerase catalyzed a slow isomerization of L-arabinose to L-ribulose and an epimerization to L-ribose. In equilibrium the reaction mixture contained 52.5% arabinose, 22.5% ribulose, and 25% ribose. In a packed-bed column filled with CLXI, a simultaneous reaction and separation resulted in fractions where arabinose concentration varied between 100-0%, ribulose between 0-55%, and ribose between 0-100%. Trichoderma reesei xylanase II hydrolyzed and transferred xylotetraose mainly to xylotriose and xylobiose. In a packed-bed column filled with CLX, xylotetraose rapidly reacted to xylobiose and xylose by a mechanism that is not yet fully understood. 
11478902	20010802	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 	Stability and function of interdomain linker variants of glucoamylase 1 from Aspergillus niger.	Several variants of glucoamylase 1 (GA1) from Aspergillus niger were created in which the highly O-glycosylated peptide (aa 468--508) connecting the (alpha/alpha)(6)-barrel catalytic domain and the starch binding domain was substituted at the gene level by equivalent segments of glucoamylases from Hormoconis resinae, Humicola grisea, and Rhizopus oryzae encoding 5, 19, and 36 amino acid residues. Variants were constructed in which the H. resinae linker was elongated by proline-rich sequences as this linker itself apparently was too short to allow formation of the corresponding protein variant. Size and isoelectric point of GA1 variants reflected differences in linker length, posttranslational modification, and net charge. While calculated polypeptide chain molecular masses for wild-type GA1, a nonnatural proline-rich linker variant, H. grisea, and R. oryzae linker variants were 65,784, 63,777, 63,912, and 65,614 Da, respectively, MALDI-TOF-MS gave values of 82,042, 73,800, 73,413, and 90,793 Da, respectively, where the latter value could partly be explained by an N-glycosylation site introduced near the linker C-terminus. The k(cat) and K(m) for hydrolysis of maltooligodextrins and soluble starch, and the rate of hydrolysis of barley starch granules were essentially the same for the variants as for wild-type GA1. beta-Cyclodextrin, acarbose, and two heterobidentate inhibitors were found by isothermal titration calorimetry to bind to the catalytic and starch binding domains of the linker variants, indicating that the function of the active site and the starch binding site was maintained. The stability of GA1 linker variants toward GdnHCl and heat, however, was reduced compared to wild-type.

D016428 D013485 	Two novel class II hydrophobins from Trichoderma spp. stimulate enzymatic hydrolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) when expressed as fusion proteins.	Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) can be functionalized and/or recycled via hydrolysis by microbial cutinases. The rate of hydrolysis is however low. Here, we tested whether hydrophobins (HFBs), small secreted fungal proteins containing eight positionally conserved cysteine residues, are able to enhance the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of PET. Species of the fungal genus Trichoderma have the most proliferated arsenal of class II hydrophobin-encoding genes among fungi. To this end, we studied two novel class II HFBs (HFB4 and HFB7) of Trichoderma. HFB4 and HFB7, produced in Escherichia coli as fusions to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase, exhibited subtle structural differences reflected in hydrophobicity plots that correlated with unequal hydrophobicity and hydrophily, respectively, of particular amino acid residues. Both proteins exhibited a dosage-dependent stimulation effect on PET hydrolysis by cutinase from Humicola insolens, with HFB4 displaying an adsorption isotherm-like behavior, whereas HFB7 was active only at very low concentrations and was inhibitory at higher concentrations. We conclude that class II HFBs can stimulate the activity of cutinases on PET, but individual HFBs can display different properties. The present findings suggest that hydrophobins can be used in the enzymatic hydrolysis of aromatic-aliphatic polyesters such as PET.  
10099291	19990401	Biotechnol._Bioeng.	D016428 	On-line study of fungal morphology during submerged growth in a small flow-through cell.	A flow-through cell is designed to measure the growth kinetics of hyphae of Aspergillus oryzae grown submerged in a well controlled environment. The different stages of the growth process are characterized, from the spore to the fully developed hyphal element with up to 60 branches and a total length lt up to 10,000 micrometer. Spore swelling is found to occur without change in the form of the spore (circularity index constant at about 1.06) and the spore volume probably increases exponentially. The germ tube appears after about 4 h. The branching frequency and the rate of germ tube extension is determined. After about 10 h growth at a glucose concentration of 250 mg L-1, 6-7 branches have been set, and both the total hyphal length lt and the number of tips increase exponentially with time. The specific growth rate of the hyphae is 0. 33 h-1 while the average rate of the extension of the growing tips approaches 55 micrometer h-1. The growth kinetics for all the branches on the main hypha have also been found. The main hypha and all the branches grow at a rate which can be modeled by saturation kinetics with respect to the branch length and with nearly equal final tip speeds (160 micrometer h-1). Branches set near the apical tip of the main hypha attain their final tip speed in the shortest time, i.e., the value of the saturation parameter is small. Finally, the influence of substrate (glucose) concentration cs on the values of the morphological parameters has been determined. It is found that saturation type kinetics can be used to describe the influence of cs on the growth. Experiments with recirculation of effluent from the cell back to the inlet strongly suggest that the fungus secretes an inducer for growth and branching. 
23590573	20130418	Microb._Cell_Fact.	D016428 D013485 	Diversity of marine bacteria producing beta-glucosidase inhibitors.	Beta-glucosidase inhibitors are being extensively studied for use as anti-diabetics, anti-obesity and anti-tumour compounds. So far, these compounds have been reported in large numbers from plants, mushrooms, algae and fungi. There are very few reports of such inhibitors from bacteria in the open literature, particularly marine bacteria; although the best known inhibitor deoxynojirimycin was isolated from bacilli and actinomycete. Through this study, we tried to discover the diversity of microbial associates of marine sponge and sediment producing β-glucosidase inhibitors. We found 41 (22.7%) out of 181 bacteria, produced such inhibitors. The inhibitors are abundant in bacterial associates of marine sponge Aka coralliphaga. When these bacteria were phylogenetically analyzed, it was found that marine bacteria producing glucosidase inhibitors belong to the phylum Firmicutes (23), Actinobacteria (9), Proteobacteria (7) and Bacteroidetes (1). A significant number of marine bacteria belonging to a wide range of bacterial taxa were found to produce β-glucosidase inhibitors. These compounds are abundantly present in bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes followed by the phylum Actinobacteria. The results nurture a hope of finding new compounds, which can inhibit glucosidases, in the bacterial domain of marine organisms. Thus, marine microbial cells can be utilized as producers of pharmacologically essential enzyme inhibitors.

D016428 D013485 	Degradation of microcrystalline cellulose and non-pretreated plant biomass by a cell-free extracellular cellulase/hemicellulase system from the extreme thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii.	Caldicellulosiruptor bescii is a cellulolytic/hemicellulolytic anaerobe, which extracellularly secretes various proteins, including multidomain cellulases with two-catalytic domains, for plant biomass degradation. Degradation by C. bescii cells has been well characterized, but degradation by the cell-free extracellular cellulase/hemicellulase system (CEC) of C. bescii has not been as well studied. In the present study, C. bescii CEC was prepared from cell-free culture supernatant, and the degradation properties for defined substrates and non-pretreated plant biomass were characterized. Four multidomain cellulases (Cbes_1857, Cbes_1859, Cbes_1865, and Cbes_1867), composed of the glycoside hydrolase families 5, 9, 10, 44, and 48, were the major enzymes identified in the CEC by mass spectrometry. The CEC degraded xylan, mannose-based substrates, β-1,4-linked glucans, including microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel), and non-pretreated timothy grass and rice straw. However, degradation of chitin, pectin, dextran, and wheat starch was not observed. The optimum temperatures for degradation activities were 75°C for timothy grass and Avicel, 85°C for carboxylmethyl cellulose, and >85°C for xylan. The optimum pH for these substrates was 5-6. The degradation activities were compared with a CEC derived from the fungus Trichoderma reesei, the most common enzyme used for plant biomass saccharification. The amounts of degraded Avicel, timothy grass, and rice straw by C. bescii CEC were 2.2-2.4-fold larger than those of T. reesei CEC. The high hydrolytic activity of C. bescii CEC might be attributed to the two-catalytic domain architecture of the cellulases.

Although ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are generally regarded as dependent upon the supply of carbon from their plant hosts, some recent papers have postulated a role for these fungi in the saprotrophic acquisition of carbon from soil. This theory was mainly based on the increase in enzymatic activity during periods of low photosynthate supply from tree hosts and emergence of the theory has led to a question about the overall influence of saprotrophy by ECM fungi on soil carbon turnover. However, I argue here that there is still not enough evidence to confirm this proposed function. My argument is based on inference from several lines of observation and concern over several aspects of the past studies. First, ECM fungi mainly inhabit deeper soil horizons, in which the availability of carbon compounds with positive energetic value is low. Second, the ability of ECM fungi to produce ligninolytic enzymes and cellulases is much weaker than that of saprotrophic basidiomycetes. This is most apparent in the low copy abundance of corresponding genes in the sequenced genomes of ECM species Laccaria bicolor and Amanita bisporigenes compared to the saprotrophic species Galerina marginata. I offer alternative hypotheses to explain the past observations of increased enzyme activity during starvation periods. These include, the induction of autolytic processes in ECM fungal mycelia or an attack on the host tissues to support escape from a dying root and to allow for a search for new hosts. 
15485921	20041016	Mol._Cell._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Recruitment of the Swi/Snf complex by Ste12-Tec1 promotes Flo8-Mss11-mediated activation of STA1 expression.	In the yeast Saccharomyces diastaticus, expression of the STA1 gene, which encodes an extracellular glucoamylase, is activated by the specific DNA-binding activators Flo8, Mss11, Ste12, and Tec1 and the Swi/Snf chromatin-remodeling complex. Here we show that Flo8 interacts physically and functionally with Mss11. Flo8 and Mss11 bind cooperatively to the inverted repeat sequence TTTGC-n-GCAAA (n = 97) in UAS1-2 of the STA1 promoter. In addition, Flo8 and Mss11 bind indirectly to UAS2-1 of the STA1 promoter by interacting with Ste12 and Tec1, which bind to the filamentation and invasion response element (FRE) in UAS2-1. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the Ste12, Tec1, Flo8, and Mss11 activators and the Swi/Snf complex bind sequentially to the STA1 promoter, as follows: Ste12 and Tec1 bind first to the FRE, whereby they recruit the Swi/Snf complex to the STA1 promoter. Next, the Swi/Snf complex enhances Flo8 and Mss11 binding to UAS1-2. In the final step, Flo8 and Mss11 directly promote association of RNA polymerase II with the STA1 promoter to activate STA1 expression. In the absence of glucose, the levels of Flo8 and Tec1 are greatly increased, whereas the abundances of two repressors, Nrg1 and Sfl1, are reduced, suggesting that the balance of transcriptional regulators may be important for determining activation or repression of STA1 expression.

Proteins secreted by the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans may be involved in invasion and could be useful in vaccine design. Despite the medical importance of this fungus, little is known about its extracellular proteins or the immune response to these antigens. To study C. neoformans extracellular proteins, 12 strains were metabolically radiolabeled and protein supernatants were analyzed. Both strain- and growth condition-dependent differences were observed. Enzymatic assays of filtered culture supernatants revealed butyrate esterase and caprylate esterase lipase activity for 11 of 12 strains, as well as acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, and beta-glucosidase activities in some strains. Serum from infected rodents immunoprecipitated several secreted proteins, consistent with in vivo expression and development of an antibody response. For strain 24067, two immunodominant species, of approximately 75 and 30 kDa, were recognized. The relative intensity of the autoradiographic bands depended on the route of infection for both rats and mice. In summary, our results indicate that (i) there are multiple proteins in C. neoformans culture supernatants, (ii) there are strain differences in supernatant protein profiles, (iii) there are differences in supernatant protein profile depending on the growth conditions, (iv) there are several new extracellular and/or cell-associated enzymatic activities, and (v) antibodies to several supernatant proteins are made in the course of infection. 
22102697	20111122	Plant_Cell_Physiol.	D016428 D013485 D016454 	Unique defense strategy by the endoplasmic reticulum body in plants.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a site for the production of secretory proteins. Plants have developed ER subdomains for protein storage. The ER body is one such structure, which is observed in Brassicaceae plants. ER bodies accumulate in seedlings and roots or in wounded leaves in Arabidopsis. ER bodies contain high amounts of the β-glucosidases PYK10/BGLU23 in seedlings and roots or BGLU18 in wounded tissues. These results suggest that ER bodies are involved in the metabolism of glycoside molecules, presumably to produce repellents against pests and fungi. When Arabidopsis roots are homogenized, PYK10 formed large protein aggregates that include other β-glucosidases (BGLU21 and BGLU22), GDSL lipase-like proteins (GLL22) and cytosolic jacalin-related lectins (PBP1/JAL30, JAL31, JAL33, JAL34 and JAL35). Glucosidase activity increases by the aggregate formation. NAI1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, regulates the expression of the ER body proteins PYK10 and NAI2. Reduced expression of NAI2, PYK10 and BGLU21 resulted in abnormal ER body formation, indicating that these components regulate ER body formation. PYK10, BGLU21 and BGLU22 possess hydrolytic activity for scopolin, a coumaroyl glucoside that accumulates in the roots of Arabidopsis, and nai1 and pyk10 mutants are more susceptible to the symbiotic fungus Piriformospora indica. Therefore, it appears that the ER body is a unique organelle of Brassicaceae plants that is important for defense against pests and fungi.

The 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene (pgk) from Trichoderma reesei was isolated by hybridization with the corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae PGK gene. The 1,545 nt long nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene codes for a 416 amino acid protein. The coding sequence contains two introns of 219 and 75 nt, respectively, at positions identical to those corresponding genes from the other filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans and Penicillum chrysogenum. This gene codes for two mRNAs of about 1.65 kb and 1.85 kb. The PGK protein of Trichoderma shows extensive homology to the PGKs of other fungi A. nidulans (77%), P. chrysogenum (73%) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (69%). However, the PGKs of the two other filamentous fungi, A. nidulans and P. chrysogenum, seem to be more closely related to each other than to the T. reesei enzyme.

We constructed several transgenic T. harzianum strains carrying multiple copies of ech42 and the corresponding gene disruptants. The level of extracellular endochitinase activity when T. harzianum was grown under inducing conditions increased up to 42-fold in multicopy strains as compared with the wild type, whereas gene disruptants exhibited practically no activity. The densities of chitin labeling of Rhizoctonia solani cell walls, after interactions with gene disruptants were not statistically significantly different than the density of chitin labeling after interactions with the wild type. Finally, no major differences in the efficacies of the strains generated as biocontrol agents against R. solani or Sclerotium rolfsii were observed in greenhouse experiments.

SUN4 is the fourth member of the SUN gene family from S. cerevisiae, whose products display high homology in their 258 amino acid C-terminal domain. SIM1, UTH1, NCA3 (the founding members) are involved in different cellular processes (DNA replication, ageing, mitochondrial biogenesis) and it is shown herein that SUN4 plays a role in the cell septation process. sun4 delta cells are larger than wild-type and begin a new cell cycle before they have separated from their mother cell. This phenotype is more pronounced in sun4Delta cells also deleted for UTH1. FACS analysis shows apparent polyploidy which disappears when the cell cycle is arrested by mating factor or nocodazole, indicating that cell septation is delayed without modification of the doubling time. Elutriated sun4 delta uth1 delta daughter cells are born larger, and therefore enter S phase sooner than their wild-type counterpart. S phase duration, as well as timing of Clb2 degradation, is normal, but cell septation is delayed. Sun4p/Scw3p was recently described as a cell wall protein (Cappellaro et al., 1998) and, consistent with this notion, electron micrographs of sun4 delta cells show defects in the final steps of cell wall septation. Our data suggest that Sun4p and Uth1p might contribute to the regulated process of cell wall morphogenesis and septation. 
22311108	20120208	Analyst	D016428 D013486 	Determination of cellulase colocalization on cellulose fiber with quantitative FRET measured by acceptor photobleaching and spectrally unmixing fluorescence microscopy.	The determination of cellulase distribution on the surface of cellulose fiber is an important parameter to understand when determining the interaction between cellulase and cellulose and/or the cooperation of different types of cellulases during the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. In this communication, a strategy is presented to quantitatively determine the cellulase colocalization using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methodology, which is based on acceptor photobleaching and spectrally unmixing fluorescence microscopy. FRET monitoring of cellulase colocalization was achieved by labeling cellulases with an appropriate pair of FRET dyes and by adopting an appropriate FRET model. We describe here that the adapted acceptor photobleaching FRET method can be successfully used to quantify cellulase colocalization regarding their binding to a cellulose fiber at a resolution <10 nm. This developed quantitative FRET method is promising for further studying the interactions between cellulase and cellulose and between different types of cellulases. 
12145937	20020731	Huan_Jing_Ke_Xue	D004740 D016428 	[The solid-state fermentation with double dynamic of gas phase for celluloses].	To utilize the advantages of solid-state fermentation for cellulose production, the solid-state fermentation with double dynamic of gas phase was proposed. The studies showed as follows: under the optimum operating conditions, the air pulsation range, the air pulsation periods and the air internal circulation, the fermentation temperatures were controlled quite well and the maximum temperature difference was 0.12 degree C/cm at a bed height of 9.0 cm; the water activity in the fermentation with steam-exploded straw as substrate was very suitable for the fungal growth; and with the observation of microbial growth by ESEM. It was discovered that air-pulsating fermentation was more advantageous to cellulose production and microorganism growth than static fermentation. The period of air-pulsating fermentation (60 h) was almost shorter 1/3 and its filter paper activity of enzymes (20.36 IU/mg) was larger 1 time than in the static fermentation with the fermentation period 84 h and the enzyme activity (10.82 IU/mg). Thus, this double dynamic of gas laid strong basis for cellulose production on a large scale.

D016428 D013485 	Construction of an engineering strain producing high yields of α-transglucosidase via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Asperillus niger.	In this study, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) was used in breeding industrial strains for the purpose of improving α-transglucosidase production. Firstly, an efficient ATMT system for Asperillus niger was established by optimization of several influencing factors, in which transformation efficiency was improved up to 14-fold compared with the initial conditions. Furthermore, binary vector pBI-Glu containing an α-transglucosidase expression cassette was constructed and transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 in order to infect A. niger. By the efficient ATMT method, the gene for α-transglucosidase, driven by strong promoter PglaA (the glucoamylase gene promoter), had a high expression level in A. niger A-8 (25.02 U/mL). The optimized ATMT system was found to be effective and suitable for A. niger, and should be a useful tool for studying the function of A. niger genes and for industrial breeding of this strain.  
15885873	20050512	Biochimie	D016428 D013485 	Purification, characterization and enzymatic degradation of YCP, a polysaccharide from marine filamentous fungus Phoma herbarum YS4108.	YCP, a mitogenic polysaccharide with its molecular weight (MW) of 2.4 x 10(3) kDa, was isolated from the mycelium of the marine filamentous fungus Phoma herbarum YS4108 by a combination of ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-32 and gel permeation over Sephacryl S-400. The detailed compositional, spectroscopic and methylation analyses of the polysaccharide demonstrated that its backbone possessed most likely a linear alpha-(1 --> 4) bonded glucopyranoside main chain co-bearing through side alpha-(1 --> 6)-linkage. The alpha-(1 --> 4) bondage of the glucopyranoside building blocks in YCP was confirmed by the observation that it could be hydrolyzed by the alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus licheniformis. A reliable concentration monitoring experimentation highlighted that the reducing sugars released continuously from YCP during its incubation with the enzyme, and the MW of the main resulting fragment weighed 0.8 x 10(4) Da with approximately 10% of YCP converted to maltose, maltotriose and glucose after a 120-min enzymatic degradation. Finally, YCP was found to be able to increase phagocytic activity of mice in vitro and in vivo, indicating that it may be looked up as a potent immunomodulator that could activate macrophages.

Analysis of a 2.4-kb cDNA of the cellulose-binding extracellular beta-glucosidase (CBGL) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium suggested that CBGL is organized into two domains, an N-terminal cellulose-binding domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Genomic sequence analysis suggested that cbgl is encoded by 30 exons. Southern analysis of DNA from homokaryotic cultures indicated that CBGL is encoded by two alleles, cbgl-1 and cbgl-2, of a single gene. 
23844049	20130712	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013486 	Sda1, a Cys2-His2 zinc finger transcription factor, is involved in polyol metabolism and fumonisin B1 production in Fusarium verticillioides.	The ubiquitous ascomycete Fusarium verticillioides causes ear rot and stalk rot of maize, both of which reduce grain quality and yield. Additionally, F. verticillioides produces the mycotoxin fumonisin B1 (FB1) during infection of maize kernels, and thus potentially compromises human and animal health. The current knowledge is fragmentary regarding the regulation of FB1 biosynthesis, particularly when considering interplay with environmental factors such as nutrient availability. In this study, SDA1 of F. verticillioides, predicted to encode a Cys-2 His-2 zinc finger transcription factor, was shown to play a key role in catabolizing select carbon sources. Growth of the SDA1 knock-out mutant (Δsda1) was completely inhibited when sorbitol was the sole carbon source and was severely impaired when exclusively provided mannitol or glycerol. Deletion of SDA1 unexpectedly increased FB1 biosynthesis, but reduced arabitol and mannitol biosynthesis, as compared to the wild-type progenitor. Trichoderma reesei ACE1, a regulator of cellulase and xylanase expression, complemented the F. verticillioides Δsda1 mutant, which indicates that Ace1 and Sda1 are functional orthologs. Taken together, the data indicate that Sda1 is a transcriptional regulator of carbon metabolism and toxin production in F. verticillioides.  
22796096	20120717	Fungal_Genet._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Functional analysis of glycoside hydrolase family 18 and 20 genes in Neurospora crassa.	Glycoside hydrolase family 18 contains hydrolytic enzymes with chitinase or endo-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (ENGase) activity, while glycoside hydrolase family 20 contains enzymes with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAGase) activity. Chitinases and NAGases are involved in chitin degradation. Chitinases are phylogenetically divided into three main groups (A, B and C), each further divided into subgroups. In this study, we investigated the functional role of 10 Neurospora crassa genes that encode chitinases, 2 genes that encode ENGases and 1 gene that encode a NAGase, using gene deletion and gene expression techniques. No phenotypic effects were detected for any of the studied group A chitinase gene deletions. Deletion of the B group member chit-1 resulted in reduced growth rate compared with the wild type (WT) strain. In combination with the presence of a predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor motif in the C-terminal of chit-1, indicating cell wall localization, these data suggest a role in cell wall remodeling during hyphal growth for chit-1. Deletion of the ENGase gene gh18-10 resulted in reduced growth rate compared with WT, increased conidiation, and increased abiotic stress tolerance. In addition, Δgh18-10 strains displayed lower secretion of extracellular proteins compared to WT and reduced levels of extracellular protease activity. The connection between gh18-10 ENGase activity and the endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation process, a stringent quality control of glycoprotein maturation, is discussed. N. crassa group C chitinase genes gh18-6 and gh18-8 were both induced during fungal-fungal interactions. However, gh18-6 was only induced during interspecific interactions, while gh18-8 displayed the highest induction levels during self-self interactions. These results provide new information on functional differentiation of fungal chitinases.

Chemical modification of carboxyl groups of glucoamylase from a mesophilic fungus, Fusarium solani, was carried out using ethylenediamine as nucleophile in the presence of water-soluble 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Modification brought about a dramatic enhancement of catalytic activity and thermal stability of glucoamylase. Temperature and pH optima of ethylenediamine-coupled glucoamylase (ECG) increased as compared with those of native enzyme. The specificity constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of native, ECG-2, ECG-11, and ECG-17 was 136, 173, 225, and 170, respectively, at 55 degrees C. The enthalpy of activation (Delta H*) and free energy of activation (Delta G*) for soluble starch hydrolysis were lower for the chemically modified forms. All of the modified forms were stable at higher temperatures and possessed high Delta G* against thermal unfolding. The effects of alpha-chymotrypsin and subtilisin on the modified forms were activating as compared with native. Moreover, denaturation of ECG-2, ECG-11, and ECG-17 in urea at 4 mol x L(-1) also showed an activation trend. A possible explanation for the thermal denaturation of native and increased thermal stability of ECG-2, ECG-11, and ECG-17 at higher temperatures is also discussed.

D003160 D016428 D013485 	Primary recovery of a genetically engineered Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I (Cel 7B) fusion protein in cloud point extraction systems.	Here we present data to demonstrate how partitioning of a hydrophilic enzyme can be directed to the hydrophobic detergent-enriched phase of an aqueous two-phase system by addition of short stretches of amino acid residues to the protein molecule. The target enzyme was the industrially important endoglucanase I, EGI (endo-1,4-beta-D-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.4, Cel7B) of Trichoderma reesei. We investigated the partitioning of three EGI variants containing various C-terminal peptide extensions including Trp-Pro motifs of different lengths and localizations. Additionally, a recently developed system composed of the thermoseparating copolymer HM-EOPO was utilized to study the effects of fusion tags. The addition of peptides containing tryptohan residues enhanced the partitioning of EGI to the HM-EOPO-rich phase. The system composed of a nonionic detergent (Agrimul NRE1205) resulted in the highest partition coefficient (K = 31) and yield (90%) with the construct EGI(core-P5)(WP)(4) containing (Trp-Pro)(4) after a short linker stretch. A recombinant strain of T. reesei Rut-C30 for large-scale production was constructed in which the fusion protein EGI(core-P5)(WP)(4) was expressed from the strong promoter of the cellulase gene cbh1. The fusion protein was successfully expressed and secreted from the fungus during shake-flask cultivations. Cultivation in a 28-L bioreactor however, revealed that the fusion protein is sensitive to proteases. Consequently, only low production levels were obtained in large-scale production trials. 
19444464	20090516	Planta	D016428 D013485 	Defense-related gene expression and enzyme activities in transgenic cotton plants expressing an endochitinase gene from Trichoderma virens in response to interaction with Rhizoctonia solani.	There are many reports on obtaining disease-resistance trait in plants by overexpressing genes from diverse organisms that encode chitinolytic enzymes. Current study represents an attempt to dissect the mechanism underlying the resistance to Rhizoctonia solani in cotton plants expressing an endochitinase gene from Trichoderma virens. Several assays were developed that provided a powerful demonstration of the disease protection obtained in the transgenic cotton plants. Transgene-dependent endochitinase activity was confirmed in various tissues and in the medium surrounding the roots of transformants. Biochemical and molecular analyses conducted on the transgenic plants showed rapid/greater induction of ROS, expression of several defense-related genes, and activation of some PR enzymes and the terpenoid pathway. Interestingly, even in the absence of a challenge from the pathogen, the basal activities of some of the defense-related genes and enzymes were higher in the endochitinase-expressing cotton plants. This elevated defensive state of the transformants may act synergistically with the potent, transgene-encoded endochitinase activity to confer a strong resistance to R. solani infection.

21724886	20110705	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013486 	Glycoside hydrolase activities of thermophilic bacterial consortia adapted to switchgrass.	Industrial-scale biofuel production requires robust enzymatic cocktails to produce fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic biomass. Thermophilic bacterial consortia are a potential source of cellulases and hemicellulases adapted to harsher reaction conditions than commercial fungal enzymes. Compost-derived microbial consortia were adapted to switchgrass at 60°C to develop thermophilic biomass-degrading consortia for detailed studies. Microbial community analysis using small-subunit rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing and short-read metagenomic sequencing demonstrated that thermophilic adaptation to switchgrass resulted in low-diversity bacterial consortia with a high abundance of bacteria related to thermophilic paenibacilli, Rhodothermus marinus, and Thermus thermophilus. At lower abundance, thermophilic Chloroflexi and an uncultivated lineage of the Gemmatimonadetes phylum were observed. Supernatants isolated from these consortia had high levels of xylanase and endoglucanase activities. Compared to commercial enzyme preparations, the endoglucanase enzymes had a higher thermotolerance and were more stable in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]), an ionic liquid used for biomass pretreatment. The supernatants were used to saccharify [C2mim][OAc]-pretreated switchgrass at elevated temperatures (up to 80°C), demonstrating that these consortia are an excellent source of enzymes for the development of enzymatic cocktails tailored to more extreme reaction conditions. 
21332624	20110222	Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Discovery and structural characterization of a novel glycosidase family of marine origin.	The genomic data on heterotrophic marine bacteria suggest the crucial role that microbes play in the global carbon cycle. However, the massive presence of hypothetical proteins hampers our understanding of the mechanisms by which this carbon cycle is carried out. Moreover, genomic data from marine microorganisms are essentially annotated in the light of the biochemical knowledge accumulated on bacteria and fungi which decompose terrestrial plants. However marine algal polysaccharides clearly differ from their terrestrial counterparts, and their associated enzymes usually constitute novel protein families. In this study, we have applied a combination of bioinformatics, targeted activity screening and structural biology to characterize a hypothetical protein from the marine bacterium Zobellia galactanivorans, which is distantly related to GH43 family. This protein is in fact a 1,3-α-3,6-anhydro-l-galactosidase (AhgA) which catalyses the last step in the degradation pathway of agars, a family of polysaccharides unique to red macroalgae. AhgA adopts a β-propeller fold and displays a zinc-dependent catalytic machinery. This enzyme is the first representative of a new family of glycoside hydrolases, especially abundant in coastal waters. Such genes of marine origin have been transferred to symbiotic microbes associated with marine fishes, but also with some specific human populations. 
1147611	19750701	Appl_Microbiol	D016428 	An unstable strain of Aspergillus foetidus segregating proline auxotrophs.	Two basic colony types have been obtained through single conidial isolation from the Bode strain of Aspergillus foetidus as well as from mutants of this unstable strain. Type I is prototrophic whereas type II is an auxotroph requiring proline. When a type I strain is grown on complex medium it gradually becomes overwhelmed by type II sectors of growth. However, essentially pure cultures of type I can be maintained on minimal medium (lacking proline). The yield of glucoamylase from type II cultures is less than half that obtained with type I cultures. The instability of type I cultures when grown on complex medium can not be explained by heterokaryosis or the presence of virus-like particles found in the original Bode strain and its derivatives. The isolation of five stable prototrophic strains obtained as more rapidly growing sectors from type I subcultures grown on complex medium suggests that the instability most probably results from a duplicated chromosomal segment or other chromosomal aberration analogous to those described in A. nidulans.

A cellobiohydrolase (CBH) with a molecular mass of 66 kD was purified from Trichoderma pseudokiningii S-38. Papain digestion produced a 59- to 60-kD core domain with 54% of intact activity on crystalline cellulose and with full activity against soluble substrates. Digestion products also included two small peptides with molecular mass of about 3-4 kD, which are heavily glycosylated and difficult to purify; the mixed peptides displayed the capacity to disorganize the cellulose fiber. The sequencing results indicated that the intact enzyme had a blocked N-terminal and there was a 10-amino-acid sequence in the N-terminal of the core protein of Ser-Gly-Thr-Ala-Val-Thr-Cys-Leu-Ala-Asp. Fluorescence and circular dichroism properties indicated that the core protein has an independent conformation and is conformationally similar to intact enzyme, suggesting that the spectroscopic properties of the intact enzyme come from the core protein.

The production of pectinase was studied in Neurospora crassa, using the hyperproducer mutant exo-1, which synthesized and secreted five to six times more enzyme than the wild-type. Polygalacturonase, pectin lyase and pectate lyase were induced by pectin, and this induction was glucose-repressible. Polygalacturonase was induced by galactose four times more efficiently than by pectin; in contrast the activity of lyases was not affected by galactose. The inducing effect of galactose on polygalacturonase was not glucose-repressible. Extracellular pectinases were separated by ion exchange chromatography. Pectate and pectin lyases eluted into three main fractions containing both activities; polygalacturonase eluted as a single, symmetrical peak, apparently free of other protein contaminants, and was purified 56-fold. The purified polygalacturonase was a monomeric glycoprotein (38% carbohydrate content) of apparent molecular mass 36.6-37.0 kDa (Sephadex G-100 and urea-SDS-PAGE, respectively). The enzyme hydrolysed predominantly polypectate. Pectin was also hydrolysed, but at 7% of the rate for polypectate. Km and Vmax for polypectate hydrolysis were 5.0 mg ml-1 and 357 mumol min-1 (mg protein)-1, respectively. Temperature and pH optima were 45 degrees C and 6.0, respectively. The purified polygalacturonase reduced the viscosity of a sodium polypectate solution by 50% with an increase of 7% in reducing sugar groups. The products of hydrolysis at initial reaction times consisted of oligogalacturonates without detectable monomer. Thus, the purified Neurospora crassa enzyme was classified as an endopolygalacturonase [poly(1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide) glycanohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.15]. 
18286267	20080221	Arch._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Addition of exogenous carbon and nitrogen sources to aphid exuviae modulates synthesis of proteases and chitinase by germinating conidia of Beauveria bassiana.	Secretion of catabolic extracellular enzymes (ECE) is the hallmark of the infection of insects through the cuticle by entomopathogenic fungi (EPF). In this paper, we show that germinating conidia of Beauveria bassiana (Bb) regulate the synthesis of ECE through a multiple control mode during the initial stages of germination. We tested Bb conidial growth on aphid exuviae with or without supplementation of additional carbon and/or nitrogen (C/N) compounds. To understand the interrelation between conidial germination during growth, the synthesis of ECE activity, free amino nitrogen (FAN), glucose and fungal dry weight biomass were measured. Immediately (0.25 h) upon incubation of conidia, activity of subtilisin-like Pr1 and trypsin-like Pr2 enzymes and chitinase (NAGase) was observed in the culture filtrates. At 0.25 h, addition of exogenous C-source resulted in higher activities of Pr1 and Pr2, respectively. Conversely at 0.25 h, addition of N-sources repressed the synthesis of Pr2, but that of Pr1. C/N repression was observed only for exponentially growing mycelia. NAGase activity remained at basal level and unaffected by added C/N. We conclude that C/N repression occurs only when it is necessary for the Bb infective structures to establish a nutritional relationship with the host structures.

The crystal structure of the 20K endoglucanase from the thermophilic fungus Melanocarpus albomyces (Ma20k) has been determined. The structure was refined to 1.8 A resolution using data obtained at 120 K. Ma20k belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 45. The three-dimensional structures of endoglucanase V (EGV) from the fungus Humicola insolens and of an endoglucanase from H. grisea var. thermoidea have previously been determined. The overall structure of Ma20k consists of a six-stranded beta-barrel domain similar to that found previously in family 45 endoglucanases. The flexible loop between strands V and VI, which was disordered in the uncomplexed structures of the Humicola endoglucanases but was ordered in complexed structures of EGV, is found to be well ordered in the native structure of Ma20k. The structure of Ma20k allows comparison between thermophilic and mesophilic proteins of family 45 and different principles for thermostability are discussed. 
9133736	19970330	Yeast	D016428 D013485 D013487 	Cloning and expression of two chitin deacetylase genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Chitin deacetylase (EC 3.5.1.41), which hydrolyses the N-acetamido groups of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in chitin, has been demonstrated in crude extracts from sporulating Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two S. cerevisiae open reading frames (ORFs), identified by the Yeast Genome Project, have protein sequence homology to a chitin deacetylase from Mucor rouxii. Northern blot hybridizations show each ORF was transcribed in diploid cells after transfer to sporulation medium and prior to formation of asci. Each ORF was cloned in a vector under transcriptional control of the GAL 1, 10 promoter and introduced back into haploid strains of S. cerevisiae. Chitin deacetylase activity was detected by in vitro assays from vegetative cells grown in galactose. Chemical analysis of these cells also demonstrated the synthesis of chitosam in vivo. Both recombinant chitin deacetylases showed similar qualitative and quantitative activities toward chitooligosaccharides in vitro. A diploid strain deleted to both ORFs, when sporulated, did not show deacetylase activity. The mutant spores were hypersensitive to lytic enzymes (Glusulase or Zymolyase). 
15164362	20040528	Yeast	D016428 D013485 	Transcriptional and post-translational regulation of neutral trehalase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe during thermal stress.	In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a heat shock enhances transcription of the ntp1(+) gene, encoding the hydrolytic enzyme neutral trehalase. As compared to wild-type cells, cells devoid of the MAP kinase Sty1p showed a strong decrease in ntp1(+) expression induced by the temperature upshift, indicating that the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway regulates the expression of this gene during heat shock. The transcription factor Atf1p, which is the main downstream target for Sty1p in the SAPK pathway, appears to be involved in such control, since ntp1(+) expression under heat shock proved to be significantly blocked in atf1(+)-disrupted cells. Serial deletion and point mutation analyses of the ntp1(+) promoter, as well as electrophoretic mobility shift assays, revealed the existence of a CRE-like element as the target for Atf1p-mediated expression under thermal stress. The relevance of two putative HSE elements located in the ntp1(+) promoter was also investigated for their potential role in regulating ntp1(+) transcription during heat shock. The results support a model in which heat-induced Atf1p binding to the CRE-like element favours the subsequent interaction of the heat shock factor (HSF) with HSE elements in the ntp1(+) promoter. Unlike what happens under osmostress or oxidative treatments, Sty1p has no role in the post-translational activation of neutral trehalase induced by heat shock in the fission yeast.

Two cellulase [EC 3.2.1.4] components derived from Meicelase, a commercial crude cellulase preparation from Trichoderma viride, were purified by consecutive column chromatography, and were designated as cellulase II-A and cellulase II-B. Cellulases II-A and II-B were each homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of cellulases II-A and II-B were 30,000 and 43,000, respectively, on the basis of Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. Both enzymes contained 12-14% carbohydrates (as glucose). Some properties of the purified cellulases were investigated. The optimum pH and temperature for cellulases II-A and II-B were pH 4.5-5.0 and 60 degrees, and pH 4.5-5.0 and 50 degrees, respectively. Both enzymes were stable over the range of pH 5.0-7.0 at 4 degrees for 24 hr. Cellulases II-A and II-B retained 27 and 41% of the original CM-cellulose-saccharifying activities, respectively, after heating at 100 degrees for 10 min. Both enzymes were completely inhibited by some metal ions such as 1 mM Hg-2+, and partially by 1 mM Ag-+ and Cu-2+. However, Mg-2+, Fe-2+, and several other metal ions showed no inhibition at this concentration. The hydrolysis of CM-cellulose by cellulase II-A was more random than that by cellulase II-B. 
17661047	20070731	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Alternate intron processing of family 5 endoglucanase transcripts from the genus Phytophthora.	Twenty-one homologs of family 5 endo-(1-4)-beta-glucanase genes (EGLs) were identified and characterized in the oomycete plant pathogens Phytophthora infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum, providing the first comprehensive analysis of this family in Phytophthora. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes constitute a unique eukaryotic group, with closest similarity to bacterial endoglucanases. Many of the identified EGL copies were clustered in a few genomic regions, and contained from zero to three introns. Using reverse transcription PCR to study in vitro and in planta gene expression levels of P. sojae, we detected partially processed RNA transcripts retaining one or more of their introns. In some cases, the positions of intron/exon splicing sites were also found to be variable. The relative proportions of these transcripts remain apparently unchanged under various growing conditions, but differ among orthologous copies of the three Phytophthora species. The alternate processing of introns in this group of EGLs generates both coding and non-coding RNA isoforms. This is the first report on Phytophthora family 5 endoglucanases, and the first record for alternative intron processing of oomycete transcripts. 
8651681	19960401	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	The construction of a stable starch-fermenting yeast strain using genetic engineering and rare-mating.	To develop a yeast strain that is able to produce ethanol directly from starch, alpha-amylase cDNA (originated from mouse salivary glands) was introduced into the hyploid Saccharomyces diastiticus cells secreting glucoamylase by using a linearized integrating vector. The integrating vector contains a LEU2 gene and the inside of the LEU2 gene was cut by KpnI to make the linearized vector. One of the transformants exhibited 100% mitotic stability after 100 generations of cell multiplication. To improve its ethanol-fermentability, the haploid transformant was rare-mated with a polyploid industrial strain having no amylase activity. The resulting hybrid RH51 produced 7.5 (w/v) ethanol directly from 20% (w/v) soluble starch and its mitotic stability was 100% at the end of fermentation. 
19817688	20091013	Biochemistry_Mosc.	D016428 	Regulatory activity of heterologous gene-activator xlnR of Aspergillus niger in Penicillium canescens.	The gene encoding the xlnR xylanolytic activator of the heterologous fungus Aspergillus niger was incorporated into the Penicillium canescens genome. Integration of the xlnR gene resulted in the increase in a number of activities, i.e. endoxylanase, beta-xylosidase, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, alpha-galactosidase, and feruloyl esterase, compared to the host P. canescens PCA 10 strain, while beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, endoglucanase, and CMCase activities remained constant. Two different expression constructs were developed. The first consisted of the nucleotide sequence containing the mature P. canescens phytase gene under control of the axhA promoter region gene encoding A. niger (1,4)-beta-D-arabinoxylan-arabinofuranohydrolase. The second construct combined the P. canescens phytase gene and the bgaS promoter region encoding homologous beta-galactosidase. Both expression cassettes were transformed into P. canescens host strain containing xlnR. Phytase synthesis was observed only for strains with the bgaS promoter on arabinose-containing culture media. In conclusion, the bgaS and axhA promoters were regulated by different inducers and activators in the P. canescens strain containing a structural tandem of the axhA promoter and the gene of the xlnR xylanolytic activator. 
23339486	20130124	Biotechnol_Biofuels	D016428 	Using a model filamentous fungus to unravel mechanisms of lignocellulose deconstruction.	Filamentous fungi are the main source of enzymes used to degrade lignocellulose to fermentable sugars for the production of biofuels. While the most commonly used organism for the production of cellulases in an industrial setting is Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina), recent work in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has shown that the variety of molecular, genetic and biochemical techniques developed for this organism can expedite analyses of the complexities involved in the utilization of lignocellulose as a source of carbon. These include elucidating regulatory networks associated with plant cell wall deconstruction, the identification of signaling molecules necessary for induction of the expression of genes encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes and the characterization of new cellulolytic enzymatic activities. In particular, the availability of a full genome deletion strain set for N. crassa has expedited high throughput screening for mutants that display a cellulolytic phenotype. This review summarizes the key findings of several recent studies using N. crassa to further understanding the mechanisms of plant cell wall deconstruction by filamentous fungi.

From the preparation of xylanase of the fungus Aspergillus niger 15 exo-1,4-beta-xylosidase was isolated by means of ethanol fractionation and chromatography on columns of Sephadex G-50, cellulose DE-52, Sephadex SP C-50, Sephadex G-200. The isolated enzyme (with the purification degree as calculated per protein 199, and yield with respect to activity 42.5%) was homogeneous during gel filtration, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of Na dodecyl sulfate, ultracentrifugation and isoelectric focusing. Exo-1,4-beta-xylosidase had a molecular mass of 253,000 as shown by gel filtration and 122,000 as shown by Na dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; its sedimentation coefficient was 10.6 S and isoelectric point was pI 4.9. The specific activity of the homogeneous enzyme was 35.2 u./mg protein with respect to p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside and 30.2 u./mg protein with respect to xylobiose. 
3732275	19860715	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 	Chitin biosynthesis by a fungal membrane preparation. Evidence for a transient non-crystalline state of chitin.	Chitin synthase activity of membrane preparations from hyphae of Schizophyllum commune was strongly inhibited by added chitinase because chitin immediately after its synthesis was highly susceptible to chitinase. In the absence of synthesis, chitin became more resistant to chitinase with time. Chitin synthesized in the presence of the optical brightener Calcofluor White M2R was extremely susceptible to degradation by chitinase and this susceptibility was maintained for a long time. X-ray diffraction analysis of chitin synthesized in the presence of Calcofluor revealed the absence of crystallinity as long as the material was kept in wet conditions. After drying, discrete deflections characteristic for alpha-chitin appeared concomitant with a decrease in the susceptibility for chitinase. These results strongly suggest the existence of a gap between polymerization and crystallization of chitin chains. 
21543515	20110506	Genome_Res.	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013486 	Comparative genomics of citric-acid-producing Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015 versus enzyme-producing CBS 513.88.	The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger exhibits great diversity in its phenotype. It is found globally, both as marine and terrestrial strains, produces both organic acids and hydrolytic enzymes in high amounts, and some isolates exhibit pathogenicity. Although the genome of an industrial enzyme-producing A. niger strain (CBS 513.88) has already been sequenced, the versatility and diversity of this species compel additional exploration. We therefore undertook whole-genome sequencing of the acidogenic A. niger wild-type strain (ATCC 1015) and produced a genome sequence of very high quality. Only 15 gaps are present in the sequence, and half the telomeric regions have been elucidated. Moreover, sequence information from ATCC 1015 was used to improve the genome sequence of CBS 513.88. Chromosome-level comparisons uncovered several genome rearrangements, deletions, a clear case of strain-specific horizontal gene transfer, and identification of 0.8 Mb of novel sequence. Single nucleotide polymorphisms per kilobase (SNPs/kb) between the two strains were found to be exceptionally high (average: 7.8, maximum: 160 SNPs/kb). High variation within the species was confirmed with exo-metabolite profiling and phylogenetics. Detailed lists of alleles were generated, and genotypic differences were observed to accumulate in metabolic pathways essential to acid production and protein synthesis. A transcriptome analysis supported up-regulation of genes associated with biosynthesis of amino acids that are abundant in glucoamylase A, tRNA-synthases, and protein transporters in the protein producing CBS 513.88 strain. Our results and data sets from this integrative systems biology analysis resulted in a snapshot of fungal evolution and will support further optimization of cell factories based on filamentous fungi.

D016428 D013485 	Enhanced saccharification of alkali-treated rice straw by cellulase from Trametes hirsuta and statistical optimization of hydrolysis conditions by RSM.	A white rot fungus, identified as Trametes hirsuta based on morphological and phylogenetic analysis, was found to contain efficient cellulose degrading enzymes. The strain showed maximum endoglucanase (EG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH) and beta-glucosidase (BGL) activities of 55, 0.28 and 5.0 U/mg-protein, respectively. Rice straw was found to be a potentially good substrate for growth of T. hirsuta for cellulase production. Statistical experimental design was used to optimize hydrolysis parameters such as pH, temperature, and concentrations of substrates and enzymes to achieve the highest saccharification yield. Enzyme concentration was identified as the limiting factor for saccharification of rice straw. A maximum saccharification rate of 88% was obtained at an enzyme concentration of 37.5 FPU/g-substrate after optimization of the hydrolysis parameters. The results of a confirmation experiment under the optimum conditions agreed well with model predictions. T. hirsuta may be a good choice for the production of reducing sugars from cellulosic biomass. 
11607454	19940201	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 	The protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A mimics elicitor action in plant cells and induces rapid hyperphosphorylation of specific proteins as revealed by pulse labeling with [33P]phosphate.	Suspension-cultured tomato cells react to microbial signals, so-called elicitors, with rapid alkalinization of the growth medium and increased biosynthesis of the stress hormone ethylene. These responses to elicitors can be blocked by staurosporine and K-252a, two specific inhibitors of protein kinases. Here we show that calyculin A, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases, mimics the action of elicitors and, at nanomolar concentrations, induces medium alkalinization as well as a strong increase in the activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase, the key enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis. Both responses were strongly inhibited by K-252a, and calyculin A induced both responses more rapidly than did a fungal elicitor, xylanase. For example, the lag phase for medium alkalinization was only 0.2-0.4 min for calyculin A, compared with 2 min for xylanase. To study changes in the dynamics of protein phosphorylation, cells were labeled with 30-sec pulses of [33P]orthophosphate. Calyculin A strongly increased phosphorylation of several polypeptide bands within 40 sec of treatment. The same phosphorylated bands also appeared in response to xylanase, but only after a lag phase of 2-3 min. These results show that the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A leads to rapid hyperphosphorylation of specific proteins in cultured cells and indicate that elicitor action could be based on inhibition of a protein phosphatase as well as on activation of a protein kinase. 
20648749	20100723	Mycologia	D016428 D013486 	Isolation and morphological and metabolic characterization of common endophytes in annually burned tallgrass prairie.	Dark septate endophytes (DSE) are common and abundant root-colonizing fungi in the native tallgrass prairie. To characterize DSE fungi were isolated from roots of mixed tallgrass prairie plant communities. Isolates were grouped according to morphology, and the grouping was refined by ITS-RFLP and/or sequencing of the ITS region. Sporulating species of Periconia, Fusarium, Microdochium and Aspergillus were isolated along with many sterile fungi. Leek resynthesis was used to quickly screen for DSE fungi among the isolates. Periconia macro-spinosa and Microdochium sp. formed typical DSE structures in the roots; Periconia produced melanized intracellular microsclerotia in host root cortex, whereas Microdochium produced abundant melanized inter- and intracellular chlamydospores. To further validate the results of the leek resynthesis growth responses of leek and a dominant prairie grass, Andropogon gerardii, were assessed in a laboratory resynthesis system. Leek growth mainly was unresponsive to the inoculation with Periconia or Microdochium, whereas Andropogon tended to respond positively. Select Periconia and Microdochium isolates were tested further for their enzymatic capabilities and for ability to use organic and inorganic nitrogen sources. These fungi tested positive for amylase, cellulase, polyphenol oxidases and gelatinase. Periconia isolates used both organic and inorganic nitrogen sources. Our study identified distinct endophytes in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem and indicated that these endo-phytes can use a variety of complex nutrient sources, suggesting facultative biotrophic and saprotrophic habits. 
11989764	20020507	Can._J._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	The relative ability of fungi from Sphagnum fuscum to decompose selected carbon substrates.	Nine species from a suite of 55 microfungi isolated from living and decomposing Sphagnum fuscum were selected for studies of in vitro decomposition of tannic acid, cellulose, and starch. In vitro decomposition of S. fuscum plants and spruce wood chips was also examined. Oidiodendron maius and Oidiodendron scytaloides degraded tannic acid, giving a positive reaction for polyphenol oxidases. Most taxa degraded cellulose and starch via the synthesis of cellulases and amylase, respectively. Mass losses of spruce wood chips generally exceeded those of S. fuscum. A basidiomycete, similar to Bjerkandera adusta, caused the greatest mass losses in spruce wood chips (10.2%), while O. scytaloides caused the smallest mass losses (3.4%) after 8 weeks. For S. fuscum, Sordaria fimicola caused the greatest (5.1%) and Mucor hiemalis the smallest (0.1%) mass losses after 8 weeks. Filamentous microfungi have considerable potential to decompose a variety of carbon substrates of bryophilous residues in peatlands. 
16407250	20060113	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Functional characterization of the Hansenula polymorpha HOC1, OCH1, and OCR1 genes as members of the yeast OCH1 mannosyltransferase family involved in protein glycosylation.	The alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase encoded by Saccharomyces cerevisiae OCH1 (ScOCH1) is responsible for the outer chain initiation of N-linked oligosaccharides. To identify the genes involved in the first step of outer chain biosynthesis in the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha, we undertook the functional analysis of three H. polymorpha genes, HpHOC1, HpOCH1, and HpOCR1, that belong to the OCH1 family containing seven members with significant sequence identities to ScOCH1. The deletions of these H. polymorpha genes individually resulted in several phenotypes suggestive of cell wall defects. Whereas the deletion of HpHOC1 (Hphoc1Delta) did not generate any detectable changes in N-glycosylation, the null mutant strains of HpOCH1 (Hpoch1Delta) and HpOCR1 (Hpocr1Delta) displayed a remarkable reduction in hypermannosylation. Although the apparent phenotypes of Hpocr1Delta were most similar to those of S. cerevisiae och1 mutants, the detailed structural analysis of N-glycans revealed that the major defect of Hpocr1Delta is not in the initiation step but rather in the subsequent step of outer chain elongation by alpha-1,2-mannose addition. Most interestingly, Hpocr1Delta showed a severe defect in the O-linked glycosylation of extracellular chitinase, representing HpOCR1 as a novel member of the OCH1 family implicated in both N- and O-linked glycosylation. In contrast, addition of the first alpha-1,6-mannose residue onto the core oligosaccharide Man8GlcNAc2 was completely blocked in Hpoch1Delta despite the comparable growth of its wild type under normal growth conditions. The complementation of the S. cerevisiae och1 null mutation by the expression of HpOCH1 and the lack of in vitro alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase activity in Hpoch1Delta provided supportive evidence that HpOCH1 is the functional orthologue of ScOCH1. The engineered Hpoch1Delta strain with the targeted expression of Aspergillus saitoi alpha-1,2-mannosidase in the endoplasmic reticulum was shown to produce human-compatible high mannose-type Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide as a major N-glycan.

In this study, we used native gradient-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution (NGGEE) to purify enzymatic proteins from Trichoderma koningii AS3.2774. With this method, we purified eight enzymatic proteins and classified them to the cellulase system by comparing secretions of T. koningii in inductive medium and in repressive medium. It resulted in 24-fold β-glucosidase (BG) purification with a recovery rate of 5.5%, and a specific activity of 994.6IUmg(-1) protein. The final yield of BG reached 8μg under purifying procedure of NGGEE. We also identified BG using the enzyme assay with thin-layer chromatography and MALDI-TOFMS. This BG had one subunit with a molecular mass of 69.1kDa as determined by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The hydrolytic activity of the BG had an optimal pH of 5.0, an optimal temperature of 50°C, an isoelectric point of 5.68 and a K(m) for p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside of 2.67mM. Taken together, we show that NGGEE is a reliable method through which μg grade of active proteins can be purified.

The treatment of chickpea milk was carried out in batch, repeated batch and continuous reaction by soluble and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) immobilized Aspergillus oryzae alpha-galactosidase for the removal of raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs). In the batch mode of treatment 96 and 92% of RFOs hydrolysis was observed by soluble and immobilized enzyme, respectively. In repeated batch experiments, immobilized enzyme showed 70% RFOs hydrolysis up to sixth cycle. Polyvinyl alcohol immobilized alpha-galactosidase in fluidized bed reactor showed highest reduction of 94% at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The results obtained from the present study are very interesting for industrial use of PVA-immobilized enzyme. 
17002458	20060928	J._Agric._Food_Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Mode of de-esterification of alkaline and acidic pectin methyl esterases at different pH conditions.	Highly esterified citrus pectin was de-esterified at pH 4.5 and 8.0 by a fungal pectin methyl esterase (PME) that was shown to have an acidic isoelectric pH (pI) and an acidic pH optimum and by a plant PME that was characterized by an alkaline pI and an alkaline pH optimum. Interchain and intrachain de-esterification patterns were studied by digestion of the pectin products with endo-polygalacturonase and subsequent analysis using size exclusion and anion-exchange chromatography. No effect of pH was observed on the de-esterification mode of either of the two enzymes. Acidic, fungal PME converted pectin according to a multiple-chain mechanism, with a limited degree of multiple attack at the intrachain level, both at pH 4.5 and at pH 8.0. A multiple-attack mechanism, with a high degree of multiple attack, was more appropriate to describe the action mode of alkaline, plant PME, both at pH 4.5 and at pH 8.0. 
19205919	20090212	Antonie_Van_Leeuwenhoek	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of a strong CCA-treated wood degrader, unknown Crustoderma species.	In this study, basidiomycete isolates that possessed a strong ability to degrade chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-treated wood were characterized. These fungal isolates, which were collected from CCA-treated pine log wastes, showed no recognizable morphological properties on culture media. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the large subunit rDNA of the isolates revealed that they were one species. Based on the high sequence similarity (>95%) and close phylogenetic relationship with several known species of Crustoderma, the fungal isolates characterized in this study were classified as a Crustoderma sp. In a wood degradation test, Crustoderma isolate KUC8611 produced a remarkably higher weight loss in CCA-treated Pinus radiata (68.7%), Pseudotsuga menziesii (39.7%), and Tsuga heterophylla (38.5%) wood than other evaluated basidiomycete species, including Crustoderma flavescens and Crustoderma corneum. In addition, extracellular enzymes for cellulose and protein degradation were detected when the isolates were cultured in chromogenic media, which supports the finding that isolate KUC8611 is a wood degrader. Furthermore, an in vitro test for metal tolerance revealed that isolate KUC8611 showed strong arsenic tolerance, but that it could not tolerate copper. Finally, isolate KUC8611 produced lower amounts of oxalic acid than copper-tolerant fungi such as Fomitopsis palustris and Antrodia vaillantii. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the degradation of CCA-treated wood by a Crustoderma species. 
9097427	19970401	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Regulation of cellulase gene expression in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei.	Basic features of regulation of expression of the genes encoding the cellulases of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei QM9414, the genes cbh1 and cbh2 encoding cellobiohydrolases and the genes egl1, egl2 and egl5 encoding endoglucanases, were studied at the mRNA level. The cellulase genes were coordinately expressed under all conditions studied, with the steady-state mRNA levels of cbh1 being the highest. Solka floc cellulose and the disaccharide sophorose induced expression to almost the same level. Moderate expression was observed when cellobiose or lactose was used as the carbon source. It was found that glycerol and sorbitol do not promote expression but, unlike glucose, do not inhibit it either, because the addition of 1 to 2 mM sophorose to glycerol or sorbitol cultures provokes high cellulase expression levels. These carbon sources thus provide a useful means to study cellulase regulation without significantly affecting the growth of the fungus. RNA slot blot experiments showed that no expression could be observed on glucose-containing medium and that high glucose levels abolish the inducing effect of sophorose. The results clearly show that distinct and clear-cut mechanisms of induction and glucose repression regulate cellulase expression in an actively growing fungus. However, derepression of cellulase expression occurs without apparent addition of an inducer once glucose has been depleted from the medium. This expression seems not to arise simply from starvation, since the lack of carbon or nitrogen as such is not sufficient to trigger significant expression. 
17392099	20070330	Asia_Pac_J_Clin_Nutr	D016428 D013485 	Antimicrobial effect of chitooligosaccharides produced by chitosanase from Pseudomonas CUY8.	The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of chitooligosaccharides prepared by chitosanase from Pseudomonas CUY8. Antimicrobial activities of different degrees of deacetylation (DD) and polymerization (DP) of chitooligosaccharides against various species of bacteria and fungi were measured. The antimicrobial effects of chitooligosaccharides compared with chitosan and chitosanase were evaluated. Inhibitory diameter of chitooligosaccharides at the concentration of 0.1% with DP 4 was 19 +/- 0.20mm, and inhibitory activity with DD 90% was 79+/- 2.1%, which were higher than other DP and DD, respectively. The results showed that antimicrobial activities of chitooligosaccharides increased with increase of DD, but decreased with increase of DP. Chitooligosaccharides, chitosan and chitosanase all showed significantly stronger antimicrobial activities against bacteria than fungi (p<0.001). Antimicrobial activities of chitooligosaccharides were significantly higher than that of chitosan (p<0.05), but insignificantly lower than that of chitosanase (p>0.05). 
16121227	20050827	Can._J._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	An improved method for detection and quantification of chitinase activities.	Chitinases are enzymes that serve critical roles in fungal growth and development, in resistance of plants to fungal pathogens, and in parasitism of insects by entomopathogenic fungi. The term "chitinase" is used for 3 enzymatic activities: N-acetylglucosaminidases, which sequentially release N-acetylglucosamine residues from the chitin polymer; chitobiosidases, which release disaccharides; and endochitinases, which cleave within the polymer and release oligosaccharides. We describe a technique where chitinases are separated on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, activities are visualized and characterized with chitinase specific substrates, and specific activities are estimated by image analysis. This technique permits a rapid determination of all of the types of chitinases present within a sample as well as their activities.

A mutant strain of Trichoderma viride producing cellulase has been obtained as a result of three-stage selection using chemical and physical factors. New variants with modified characteristics appeared after the action of nitroso compounds on a suspension of conidia at the first stage of selection and the action of temperature at the second stage. The new characteristics were intensified and became stable at the third stage of selection.

8787411	19960601	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Improved production of Trichoderma harzianum endochitinase by expression in Trichoderma reesei.	The chromosomal endochitinase gene (ThEn-42) of the mycoparasite fungus Trichoderma harzianum P1 was isolated and overexpressed in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei under the promoter of the major cellulase gene cbhl1. The host strain RutC-30 did not produce any endogenous endochitinase activity. The prepro region of the T harzianum endochitinase was correctly processed in T. reesei. No differences in expression were observed when the prepro region was replaced with the CBHI signal sequence. Shake flask cultivation yielded 130 mg of active enzyme per liter, which in terms of activity represents about a 20-fold increase over the endochitinase activity produced by T. harzianum. The presence of multiple copies of the expression cassette in the transformant resulted in limitation in transcription and/or regulation factors needed for full activity of the cbh1 promoter, although this was not the major limiting factor for higher expression of endochitinase. The endochitinase was very sensitive to an acidic protease at the late stages of T. reesei cultivation. T. reesei RutC-30 appeared to be tolerant of the endochitinase and can be used as a production host for this enzyme, which has antifungal activity toward plant pathogens. 
23054399	20121012	ACS_Chem._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Identification and characterization of a multifunctional dye peroxidase from a lignin-reactive bacterium.	Plant biomass represents a renewable feedstock that has not yet been fully tapped because of the difficulty in accessing the carbon in its structural biopolymers. Lignin is an especially challenging substrate, but select microbes have evolved complex systems of enzymes for its breakdown through a radical-mediated oxidation process. Fungal systems are well-characterized for their ability to depolymerize lignin, but the ability of bacteria to react with this substrate remains elusive. We have therefore focused on elucidating strategies used by lignin-reactive soil bacteria and describing their oxidative enzyme systems. We now report the identification and characterization of an unusual C-type dye-decolorizing peroxidase from Amycolatopsis sp. 75iv2 (DyP2), which belongs to a family of heme peroxidases reported to be involved in bacterial lignin degradation. Biochemical studies indicate that DyP2 has novel function for this family, with versatile and high activity both as a peroxidase and Mn peroxidase (k(cat)/K(M) ≈ 10(5)-10(6) M(-1) s(-1)). It also has a Mn-dependent oxidase mode of action that expands its substrate scope. Crystallographic studies of DyP2 at 2.25 Å resolution show the existence of a Mn binding pocket and support its key role in catalysis.

D016428 D013485 	Characterization of mutants devoid of neutral trehalase activity in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe: partial protection from heat shock and high-salt stress.	Exposure of cells of Schizosaccharomyces pombe to heat shock or osmotic upshift results in an increased level of neutral trehalase activity, which is responsible for hydrolysis of intracellular trehalose. We constructed S. pombe mutants lacking neutral trehalase activity by gene replacement at the newly defined ntp1+ locus. Analysis of these mutants revealed that a twofold increase in trehalose accumulation, enhanced acquired thermoresistance, and marked salt tolerance characterized their ability to grow in liquid and solid media. Analysis of the expression of the trehalase gene under heat shock and osmotic upshift revealed the transcriptional activation of ntp1+ in response to both stresses. 
18647384	20080724	BMC_Evol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Phylogenetic analyses suggest multiple changes of substrate specificity within the glycosyl hydrolase 20 family.	Beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase 20 (GH20) family are involved in the removal of terminal beta-glycosidacally linked N-acetylhexosamine residues. These enzymes, widely distributed in microorganisms, animals and plants, are involved in many important physiological and pathological processes, such as cell structural integrity, energy storage, pathogen defence, viral penetration, cellular signalling, fertilization, development of carcinomas, inflammatory events and lysosomal storage diseases. Nevertheless, only limited analyses of phylogenetic relationships between GH20 genes have been performed until now. Careful phylogenetic analyses of 233 inferred protein sequences from eukaryotes and prokaryotes reveal a complex history for the GH20 family. In bacteria, multiple gene duplications and lineage specific gene loss (and/or horizontal gene transfer) are required to explain the observed taxonomic distribution. The last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes is likely to have possessed at least one GH20 family member. At least one gene duplication before the divergence of animals, plants and fungi as well as other lineage specific duplication events have given rise to multiple paralogous subfamilies in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses also suggest that a second, divergent subfamily of GH20 family genes present in animals derive from an independent prokaryotic source. Our data suggest multiple convergent changes of functional roles of GH20 family members in eukaryotes. This study represents the first detailed evolutionary analysis of the glycosyl hydrolase GH20 family. Mapping of data concerning physiological function of GH20 family members onto the phylogenetic tree reveals that apparently convergent and highly lineage specific changes in substrate specificity have occurred in multiple GH20 subfamilies. 
21072376	20101113	Metallomics	D016428 D013485 	Inhibitory effect of CuSO₄ on α-glucosidase activity in ddY mice.	We investigated the effects of divalent alkaline earth and first-row transition metal and zinc ions on α-glucosidase activity in vitro and in vivo. CuSO₄ and ZnSO₄ exhibited a high α-glucosidase inhibitory effect in vitro. The IC(50) values of CuSO₄ were 0.77 ± 0.01 (substrate; maltose) and 0.78 ± 0.01 (substrate; sucrose), and those of ZnSO₄ were 5.49 ± 0.14 (substrate; maltose) and 4.70 ± 0.06 (substrate; sucrose) for yeast α-glucosidase. On the basis of Lineweaver-Burk plots, both CuSO₄ and ZnSO₄ exhibited different modes of inhibition against α-glucosidase. Subsequently, oral glucose and sucrose tolerance tests (OGTT and OSTT) were performed on non-diabetic ddY mice to examine the effect of the metal ions on their blood glucose levels. As a result of single oral administration of CuSO₄ in non-diabetic ddY mice, a significant and potent lowering of the blood glycemic response toward disaccharide, sucrose, ingestion was observed at 45 min after doses of 0.08 and 0.24 mmol kg(-1) body weight. In contrast, the CuSO₄ administration showed no suppression of the elevation of blood glucose levels in mice after a monosaccharide, glucose, administration. These results indicate that CuSO₄ suppresses disaccharide digestion by inhibiting α-glucosidase activity in the epithelium of the small intestine, suggesting that antidiabetic Cu complexes with some ligands have a similar action mechanism to that of α-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, currently used for clinical purposes. 
15928849	20050602	Biotechnol._Lett.	D016428 D016454 	Microbial pectic transeliminases.	Pectic transeliminases, also known as pectic lyases or pectinases, are involved in the degradation of pectic substances. They have a wide range of applications in food and textile processing. Although Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. produce pectin lyases, bacteria are the major producers of polygalacturonate lyase. The yields of pectic transeliminases are less than other pectinases. Since new applications for pectic transeliminases are emerging, an improved process for the production of these enzymes is necessary. 
21377353	20110308	Bioresour._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Dynamic synergistic effect on Trichoderma reesei cellulases by novel β-glucosidases from Taiwanese fungi.	Dynamic synergistic effects in cellulosic bioconversion have been revealed between Trichoderma reesei cellulases and β-glucosidases (BGLs) from six Taiwanese fungi. A high level of synergy (8.9-fold) was observed with the addition of Chaetomella raphigera BGL to T. reesei cellulases. In addition, the C. raphigera BGL possessed the highest activity (V(max)/K(m)=46.6 U/mg mM) and lowest glucose inhibition (Ki=4.6mM) with the substrate 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside. For the natural cellobiose substrate, however, the previously isolated Aspergillus niger BGL Novo-188 had the highest V(max)/K(m) (0.72 U/mg mM) and lowest Ki (59.5mM). The demonstrated dynamic synergistic effects between some BGLs and the T. reesei cellulase system suggest that BGLs not only prevent the inhibition by cellobiose, but also enhance activities of endo- and exo-cellulases in cellulosic bioconversion. Comparisons of kinetic parameters and synergism analyses between BGLs and T. reesei cellulases can be used for further optimization of the cellulosic bioconversion process. 
8621525	19960412	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013487 	A mutant yeast deficient in Golgi transport of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine.	Mannan chains of Kluyveromyces lactis mannoproteins are similar to those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae except that they have terminal alpha1-->2-linked N-acetylglucosamine and lack mannose phosphate. In a previous study, Douglas and Ballou (Douglas, R. K., and Ballou, C. E. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 1561-1570) characterized a mutant, mnn2-2, which lacked terminal N-acetylglucosamine in its mannoproteins. The mutant had normal levels of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, and the partially purified enzyme from wild-type and mutant cells had the same apparent size, heat stability, affinity for substrates, metal requirement, and subcellular location. No qualitative or quantitative differences were found between mutant and wild-type cells in endogenous mannan acceptors and pools of UDP-GlcNAc. Chitin was synthesized at similar rates in wild-type and mutant cells, and the latter did not have a soluble inhibitor of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase or a hexosaminidase that could remove N-acetylglucosamine from mannoproteins. Together, the above observations led Douglas and Ballou ((1982) Biochemistry 21, 1561-1570) to postulate that the mutant might have a defect in compartmentation of substrates involved in the biosynthesis of mannoproteins. We determined whether the above mutant phenotype is the result of defective transport of UDP-GlcNAc into Golgi vesicles from K. lactis. Golgi vesicles which were sealed and of the same membrane topographical orientation as in vivo were isolated from wild-type and mnn2-2 mutant cells and incubated with UDP-GlcNAc in an assay in vitro. The initial rate of transport of UDP-GlcNAc into Golgi vesicles from wild-type cells was temperature dependent, saturable with an apparent Km of 5.5 microM and a Vmax of 8.2 pmol/mg of protein/3 min. No transport of UDP-GlcNAc was detected into Golgi vesicles from mutant cells. However, Golgi vesicles from both cells translocated GDP-mannose at comparable velocities, indicating that the above transport defect is specific. In addition to the above defect in mannoproteins, mutant cells were also deficient in the biosynthesis of glucosamine containing lipids.

In recent years the potential of using microbes as biotechnological sources of industrially relevant enzymes has stimulated a renewed interest in the exploration of new unconventional habitats like trove of natural biodiversity. In this work, grape marcs was selected as extreme environment because of its limited nutrients, exposure to solar radiation, temperature fluctuations and ethanol. One hundred and eighty non-Saccharomyces yeasts and two hundred and twenty Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were screened for the production of extracellular amylases, cellulases, lipases, pectinases, proteases and xylanases. Two non-Saccharomyces strains were found effective for the hydrolysis of cellulose and starch while eleven S. cerevisiae isolates were described as proficient pectinase producers. For the first time, thirteen S. cerevisiae strains, potentially able to use starch as the sole carbon source, were reported and their potential amylolytic phenotype was found to be related to a non extracellular alpha-amylase. This study encourages the selection of yeasts isolated from grape marcs as sources of unusual and industrially interesting enzymes for future biotechnological applications.  
14614785	20031115	BMC_Genomics	D016428 D013485 	In silico and in vivo analysis reveal a novel gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae trehalose metabolism.	The ability to respond rapidly to fluctuations in environmental changes is decisive for cell survival. Under these conditions trehalose has an essential protective function and its concentration increases in response to enhanced expression of trehalose synthase genes, TPS1, TPS2, TPS3 and TSL1. Intriguingly, the NTH1 gene, which encodes neutral trehalase, is highly expressed at the same time. We have previously shown that trehalase remains in its inactive non-phosphorylated form by the action of an endogenous inhibitor. Recently, a comprehensive two-hybrid analysis revealed a 41-kDa protein encoded by the YLR270w ORF, which interacts with NTH1p. In this work we investigate the correlation of this Trehalase Associated Protein, in trehalase activity regulation. The neutral trehalase activity in the ylr270w mutant strain was about 4-fold higher than in the control strain. After in vitro activation by PKA the ylr270w mutant total trehalase activity increased 3-fold when compared to a control strain. The expression of the NTH1 gene promoter fused to the heterologous reporter lacZ gene was evaluated. The mutant strain lacking YLR270w exhibited a 2-fold increase in the NTH1-lacZ basal expression when compared to the wild type strain. These results strongly indicate a central role for Ylr270p in inhibiting trehalase activity, as well as in the regulation of its expression preventing a wasteful futile cycle of synthesis-degradation of trehalose. 
23456755	20130305	Biotechnol._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485 D016454 	Visualizing cellulase activity.	Commercial exploitation of lignocellulose for biotechnological production of fuels and commodity chemicals requires efficient-usually enzymatic-saccharification of the highly recalcitrant insoluble substrate. A key characteristic of cellulose conversion is that the actual hydrolysis of the polysaccharide chains is intrinsically entangled with physical disruption of substrate morphology and structure. This "substrate deconstruction" by cellulase activity is a slow, yet markedly dynamic process that occurs at different length scales from and above the nanometer range. Little is currently known about the role of progressive substrate deconstruction on hydrolysis efficiency. Application of advanced visualization techniques to the characterization of enzymatic degradation of different celluloses has provided important new insights, at the requisite nano-scale resolution and down to the level of single enzyme molecules, into cellulase activity on the cellulose surface. Using true in situ imaging, dynamic features of enzyme action and substrate deconstruction were portrayed at different morphological levels of the cellulose, thus providing new suggestions and interpretations of rate-determining factors. Here, we review the milestones achieved through visualization, the methods which significantly promoted the field, compare suitable (model) substrates, and identify limiting factors, challenges and future tasks. 
12175020	20020815	Plant_Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Tobacco-expressed Brassica juncea chitinase BjCHI1 shows antifungal activity in vitro.	We have previously isolated a Brassica juncea cDNA encoding BjCHI1, a novel chitinase with two chitin-binding domains, and have shown that its mRNA is induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate treatment (K.-J. Zhao and M.-L. Chye, Plant Mol. Biol. 40 (1999) 1009-1018). By the presence of two chitin-binding domains, BjCHI1 resembles the precursor of UDA (Urtica dioica agglutinin) but, unlike UDA, BjCHI1 retains its chitinase catalytic domain after post-translational processing. Here, we indicate the role of BjCHI1 in plant defense by demonstrating its mRNA induction upon Aspergillus niger infection or caterpillar Pieris rapae (L.) feeding. To further investigate the biological properties of BjCHI1, we transformed tobacco with a construct expressing the BjCHI1 cDNA from the CaMV 35S promoter. Subsequently, we purified BjCHI1 from the resultant transgenic Ro plants using a regenerated chitin column followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Also, the significance of the second chitin-binding domain in BjCHI1 was investigated by raising transgenic tobacco plants expressing BjCHI2, a deletion derivative of BjCHI1 lacking one chitin-binding domain. Colorimetric chitinase assays at 25 degrees C, pH 5, showed no significant differences between the activities of BjCHI1 and BjCHI2, suggesting that chitinase activity, due to the catalytic domain, is not enhanced by the presence of a second chitin-binding domain. Both BjCHI1 and BjCHI2 show in vitro anti-fungal activity toward Trichoderma viride, causing reductions in hyphal diameter, hyphal branching and conidia size. 
3936918	19850101	J._Basic_Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Production, localization and glucose repression of beta-glucosidase in Trichoderma longibrachiatum.	Optimal production of beta-glucosidase was obtained by incubating the culture at 27 degrees C in a growth medium that had an initial pH of 5.0 and contained cellobiose. The bulk of the enzyme (70%) was present in a cell-associated state (cell debris and cytosol) while only a small portion (30%) appeared in the culture filtrate. When cellulosic substrates were used, the major portion of the enzyme (70%) appeared in the extracellular fraction. A repression of the enzyme occurred in the presence of glucose. A drop of the pH of the medium during the exponential growth phase coincided with a rapid inactivation of the enzyme. The glucose effect was most likely mediated by adverse effects of low pH on the integrity of the enzyme. 
23936804	20130813	Biomed_Res_Int	D016428 D013485 	Use of Metarhizium anisopliae chitinase genes for genotyping and virulence characterization.	Virulence is the primary factor used for selection of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) for development as biopesticides. To understand the genetic mechanisms underlying differences in virulence of fungal isolates on various arthropod pests, we compared the chitinase genes, chi2 and chi4, of 8 isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae. The clustering of the isolates showed various groups depending on their virulence. However, the analysis of their chitinase DNA sequences chi2 and chi4 did not reveal major divergences. Although their protein translates have been implicated in fungal virulence, the predicted protein structure of chi2 was identical for all isolates. Despite the critical role of chitin digestion in fungal infection, we conclude that chi2 and chi4 genes cannot serve as molecular markers to characterize observed variations in virulence among M. anisopliae isolates as previously suggested. Nevertheless, processes controlling the efficient upregulation of chitinase expression might be responsible for different virulence characteristics. Further studies using comparative "in vitro" chitin digestion techniques would be more appropriate to compare the quality and the quantity of chitinase production between fungal isolates.

D016428 D013485 D013486 	Physiological and fermentation properties of Bacillus coagulans and a mutant lacking fermentative lactate dehydrogenase activity.	Bacillus coagulans, a sporogenic lactic acid bacterium, grows optimally at 50-55 °C and produces lactic acid as the primary fermentation product from both hexoses and pentoses. The amount of fungal cellulases required for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) at 55 °C was previously reported to be three to four times lower than for SSF at the optimum growth temperature for Saccharomyces cerevisiae of 35 °C. An ethanologenic B. coagulans is expected to lower the cellulase loading and production cost of cellulosic ethanol due to SSF at 55 °C. As a first step towards developing B. coagulans as an ethanologenic microbial biocatalyst, activity of the primary fermentation enzyme L-lactate dehydrogenase was removed by mutation (strain Suy27). Strain Suy27 produced ethanol as the main fermentation product from glucose during growth at pH 7.0 (0.33 g ethanol per g glucose fermented). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) acting in series contributed to about 55% of the ethanol produced by this mutant while pyruvate formate lyase and ADH were responsible for the remainder. Due to the absence of PDH activity in B. coagulans during fermentative growth at pH 5.0, the l-ldh mutant failed to grow anaerobically at pH 5.0. Strain Suy27-13, a derivative of the l-ldh mutant strain Suy27, that produced PDH activity during anaerobic growth at pH 5.0 grew at this pH and also produced ethanol as the fermentation product (0.39 g per g glucose). These results show that construction of an ethanologenic B. coagulans requires optimal expression of PDH activity in addition to the removal of the LDH activity to support growth and ethanol production. 
9611196	19980611	Genetics	D016428 D013485 	Involvement of protein N-glycosyl chain glucosylation and processing in the biosynthesis of cell wall beta-1,6-glucan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	beta-1,6-Glucan plays a key structural role in the yeast cell wall. Of the genes involved in its biosynthesis, the activity of Cwh41p is known, i.e., the glucosidase I enzyme of protein N-chain glucose processing. We therefore examined the effects of N-chain glucosylation and processing mutants on beta-1,6-glucan biosynthesis and show that incomplete N-chain glucose processing results in a loss of beta-1,6-glucan, demonstrating a relationship between N-chain glucosylation/processing and beta-1,6-glucan biosynthesis. To explore the involvement of other N-chain-dependent events with beta-1,6-glucan synthesis, we investigated the Saccharomyces cerevisiae KRE5 and CNE1 genes, which encode homologs of the "quality control" components UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase and calnexin, respectively. We show that the essential activity of Kre5p is separate from its possible role as a UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. We also observe a approximately 30% decrease in beta-1,6-glucan upon disruption of the CNE1 gene, a phenotype that is additive with other beta-1,6-glucan synthetic mutants. Analysis of the cell wall anchorage of the mannoprotein alpha-agglutinin suggests the existence of two beta-1,6-glucan biosynthetic pathways, one N-chain dependent, the other involving protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol modification. 
16175204	20050922	Can._J._Microbiol.	D016428 D013486 	A mannanase, ManA, of the polycentric anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2 has carbohydrate binding and docking modules.	The anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2 produces a broad spectrum of glycoside hydrolases, most of which are components of a high molecular mass cellulosomal complex. Here we report about a cDNA (manA) having 1924 bp isolated from the fungus and found to encode a polypeptide of 579 amino acid residues. Analysis of the deduced sequence revealed that it had a mannanase catalytic module, a family 1 carbohydrate-binding module, and a noncatalytic docking module. The catalytic module was homologous to aerobic fungal mannanases belonging to family 5 glycoside hydrolases, but unrelated to the previously isolated mannanases (family 26) of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces. No mannanase activity could be detected in Escherichia coli harboring a manA-containing plasmid. The manA was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and ManA was secreted into the culture medium in multiple forms. The purified extracellular heterologous mannanase hydrolyzed several types of mannan but lacked activity against cellulose, chitin, or beta-glucan. The enzyme had high specific activity toward locust bean mannan and an extremely broad pH profile. It was stable for several hours at 50 degrees C, but was rapidly inactivated at 60 degrees C. The carbohydrate-binding module of the Man A produced separately in E. coli bound preferably to insoluble lignocellulosic substrates, suggesting that it might play an important role in the complex enzyme system of the fungus for lignocellulose degradation. 
8366083	19930915	J._Biol._Chem.	D003160 D016428 	Triggering of cellulase biosynthesis by cellulose in Trichoderma reesei. Involvement of a constitutive, sophorose-inducible, glucose-inhibited beta-diglucoside permease.	We prepared [U-14C]cellobiose by cultivating Acetobacter pasteurianus in the presence of [U-14C]glucose and hydrolyzing the [U-14C]cellulose formed with beta-glucosidase-free cellulase from Trichoderma reesei. This 14C-labeled cellobiose was used to investigate the presence of an uptake system for cellobiose in T. reesei. Evidence was obtained for the presence of a high affinity (Km for cellobiose 0.3 microM) but low activity (2.5 milliunits/mg fungal dry weight) cellobiose permease. The permease is formed constitutively, but higher levels are formed after addition of sophorose (glucosyl-beta-1,2-diglucoside), a reputed cellulase inducer. The permease appears to be specific for beta-diglucosides, as the uptake of [U-14C]cellobiose is inhibited by sophorose, gentiobiose (glucosyl-beta-1,3-glucoside), and cellobiose. Under these conditions, cellooligodextrines (n, 4-7; final concentration, 1 mM) are not inhibitors. Glucose, but no other monosaccharides, inhibits the permease. The hypersecretory mutant T. reesei RUT C-30 exhibits elevated permease activities, whereas in T. reesei QM 9979, a mutant strain defective in the induction of cellulases by cellulose or sophorose, strongly reduced permease activities were demonstrated. The results stress a hitherto not recognized point of control in the induction of cellulases by T. reesei at the level of uptake of cellulose oligosaccharides.

Candida albicans chitinase isolated using the Dyno-Mill disruption technique was characterized using an improved radiometric assay procedure. The enzyme had apparent temperature and pH optima of 45 degrees C and 6.5, respectively. The preparation yielded an apparent Km of 3.9 mg chitin ml-1 [17.6 mM-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) equivalents] and V of 2.3 nmol GlcNAc formed min-1 (mg protein)-1. The potential of the streptomycete antibiotic allosamidin as an antifungal agent is discussed in view of its dose-dependent inhibition of C. albicans chitinase activity (IC50 = 0.3 microM). Allosamidin was a potent competitive inhibitor of enzyme activity (Ki = 0.23 microM).

Extracellular feruloyl esterases from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger are induced by growth on oat spelt xylan (OSX), which contains no detectable esterified ferulic acid. FAE-III accounted for most of the feruloyl esterase activity. Addition of free ferulic acid to OSX at the start of the culture induced FAE-III secretion a further 2.3-fold, and also induced other feruloyl esterases which could not be ascribed to FAE-III. Wheat bran-(WB)-grown cultures, containing 1% (m/v) esterlinked ferulic acid, gave almost identical FAE-III and total feruloyl esterase activities as the cultures grown on OSX plus ferulic acid. De-esterification of WB yielded less total feruloyl esterase, and 2.4-fold less FAE-III, compared to untreated WB. A slightly modified form of FAE-III was produced on de-esterified WB. These results show that production of FAE-III does not absolutely require ferulic acid. However, production is stimulated by the presence of free ferulic acid through increased expression, and is reduced by the removal of esterified ferulic acid from the growth substrate. 
21168763	20101221	Chem._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Natural product-guided discovery of a fungal chitinase inhibitor.	Natural products are often large, synthetically intractable molecules, yet frequently offer surprising inroads into previously unexplored chemical space for enzyme inhibitors. Argifin is a cyclic pentapeptide that was originally isolated as a fungal natural product. It competitively inhibits family 18 chitinases by mimicking the chitooligosaccharide substrate of these enzymes. Interestingly, argifin is a nanomolar inhibitor of the bacterial-type subfamily of fungal chitinases that possess an extensive chitin-binding groove, but does not inhibit the much smaller, plant-type enzymes from the same family that are involved in fungal cell division and are thought to be potential drug targets. Here we show that a small, highly efficient, argifin-derived, nine-atom fragment is a micromolar inhibitor of the plant-type chitinase ChiA1 from the opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Evaluation of the binding mode with the first crystal structure of an A. fumigatus plant-type chitinase reveals that the compound binds the catalytic machinery in the same manner as observed for argifin with the bacterial-type chitinases. The structure of the complex was used to guide synthesis of derivatives to explore a pocket near the catalytic machinery. This work provides synthetically tractable plant-type family 18 chitinase inhibitors from the repurposing of a natural product.

In a four-week experiment on rats' diets containing 5% of sucrose or fructooligosaccharides (FOS) diversified in terms of kestose and nystose contents: 6:1 (FOS-K), 3:1 (FOS-KN), and 0.5:1 (FOS-N) were applied. All FOS preparations, primarily FOS-N, considerably increased the mass of caecum, lowered pH of caecal digesta, and increased concentrations of protein. The glycolytic activity of the caecal digesta was generally alike in all groups, except for the control group where the activity of beta-glucosidase was negligibly lower and that of alpha-galactosidase higher. The administration of FOS preparation with a diet increased the concentration and the pool of total VFA in the caecal digesta, especially in the case of butyric and propionic acids and decreased the concentration of iso-butyric and valeric acids. When compared with the kestose-rich preparation, the nystose-rich preparation increased the production of total VFA in the caecum, primarily of n-butyrate and propionate. Different length of kestose and nystose chains had no effect on the activity of bacterial enzymes in the caecum nor the biochemical indices of serum, concentration of cholesterol, glucose, urea, Ca, P and Mg.

To construct a yeast one-hybrid system and isolate transcriptional activators. A 1.1-kb promoter region of xylanase2 from Trichoderma reesei was cloned by PCR and sequenced (GenBank accession number: AY263380). Sequence analysis revealed that typical binding sites for several transcription factors in filamentous fungi, such as CREI, XLNR, ALCR, AREA and CCAAT enhancer, are located in the promoter. To isolate xyn2 transcription factors, the reporter plasmid of a yeast one-hybrid system was constructed on the backbone of the plasmid pRS415 containing the leu2 selective marker, with the xyn2 promoter region and Saccharomyces cerevisiae his4 as a reporter gene. The reporter gene contained 123-bp minimal promoter region. The S. cerevisiae H158 strain containing the reporter plasmid was transformed with a T. reesei expression cDNA library, and 34 transformants were collected from SC-Leu-His-Ura plates. The isolation of the gene ace2 from several transformants showed that the one-hybrid system approach was successful. Then, approx. 59 mg l(-1) of ace2 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The yeast one-hybrid system is suitable for isolating transcription factors of filamentous fungi. ACE II is a main and universal transcriptional activator that controls cellulase and hemicellulase transcription regulation in T. reesei. 
15636746	20050108	Res._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Proper folding of the antifungal protein PAF is required for optimal activity.	The Penicillium chrysogenumantifungal protein PAF is secreted into the supernatant after elimination of a preprosequence. PAF is actively internalized into the hyphae of sensitive molds and provokes growth retardation as well as changes in morphology. Thus far, no information is available on the exact mode of action of PAF, nor on the function of its prosequence in protein activity. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of secreted PAF as well as of intracellularly retained pro-PAF and mature PAF on the sensitive ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans, and transformed this model organism by expression vectors containing 5'-sequentially truncated paf-coding sequences under the control of the inducible P. chrysogenum-derived xylanase promoter. Indirect immunofluorescence staining revealed the localization of recombinant PAF predominantly in the hyphal tips of the transformant Xylpaf1 which expressed prepro-PAF, whereas the protein was found to be distributed intracellularly within all segments of hyphae of the transformants Xylpaf2 and Xylpaf3 which expressed pro-PAF and mature PAF, respectively. Growth retardation of Xylpaf1 and Xylpaf3 hyphae was detected by proliferation assays and by light microscopy analysis. Using transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin hyphal sections a marked alteration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure in Xylpaf1 was observed and an elevated amount of carbonylated proteins pointed to severe oxidative stress in this strain. The effects induced by secreted recombinant PAF resembled those evoked by native PAF. The results give evidence that properly folded PAF is a prerequisite for its activity.

D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of an extracellular alpha-glucosidase protein from Trichoderma viride which degrades a phytotoxin associated with sheath blight disease in rice.	To purify and characterize an extracellular alpha-glucosidase from Trichoderma viride capable of inactivating a host-specific phytotoxin, designated RS toxin, produced by the rice sheath blight pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani Kühn. The host-specific RS toxin was purified from both culture filtrates (culture filtrate toxin, CFTox) and R. solani-inoculated rice sheaths (sheath blight toxin, SBTox). Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses of extracellular proteins, purified from a biocontrol fungus T. viride (TvMNT7) grown on SBTox and CFTox separately, were carried out. The antifungal activity of the purified high molecular weight protein (110 kDa) was studied against RS toxin as well as on the sclerotial germination and mycelial growth of R. solani. Enzyme assay and Western blot analysis with the antirabbit TvMNT7 110-kDa protein indicated that the protein was an alpha-glucosidase. The 110-kDa protein was highly specific to RS toxin and its Michaelis-Menten constant value was 0.40 mmol l-1 when p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside was used as the substrate. The isoelectric point of the protein was 5.2. N-terminal sequencing of the alpha-glucosidase protein showed that its amino acid sequence showed no homology with other known alpha-glucosidases. This appears to be the first report of the purification and characterization of an alpha-glucosidase capable of inactivating a host-specific toxin of fungal origin. The alpha-glucosidase is specific to RS toxin and is different from the known alpha-glucosidases. As RS toxin could be inactivated by the microbial alpha-glucosidase enzyme, isolation of the gene that codes for the enzyme from T. viride and transfer of the gene to rice plants would lead to enhanced resistance against sheath blight pathogen by inactivation of RS toxin.

D016428 D013485 	Purification of ß-glucosidases from Pichia etchellsii using CIM monolith columns.	β-Glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) are industrially important glycosyl hydrolases used for cellulose saccharification as well as for synthesis of glyco-conjugates. Crystal structure of only one β-glucosidase of family 3 of the glycosyl hydrolase families is available due to difficulty in purification of these closely related enzymes from a given source. Multiple steps used during purification result in low yield, making it difficult to study their properties. Conditions for purification of two closely related β-glucosidases (BGL I and BGL II) of family 3 from Pichia etchellsii were investigated in this study. Two weak anion exchange columns convective interaction media-diethyl amino ethyl (CIM-DEAE) and CIM-ethylenediamine (CIM-EDA) were used for this purpose. The results obtained at 0.34 ml disk (CIM-DEAE) level were scaled up to 8 ml CIM-DEAE tube column wherein BGL I and BGL II were separated from the major contaminants in the cell-free extract. The recovered enzymes were completely resolved in the second step using CIM-EDA. A final specific activity of 9,180 IU/mg and 2,345.3 IU/mg was achieved for BGL I and BGL II respectively with an overall yield of 33%. The system should be applicable to resolution of other closely related enzymes from this family. 
17929596	20071013	Rocz_Panstw_Zakl_Hig	D004740 D016428 	[A study of the growth and enzymatic activity of Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton ajelloi isolates from sewage sludge].	The study was to compare growth and enzymatic activity of Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton ajelloi isolates from sewage sludge. Agar media and the API-ZYM test were used. The isolates showed weak gelatinase, catalase and urease activities and did not produce cellulase, pectate lyase and polygalacturonase. In some strains poor amylase and DNA-se activities were observed. No strain was able to hydrolyze casein. The strains were found to hydrolyze tributyrin, rapeseed oil and Biodiesel oil and to grow on Diesel oil medium. On the medium containing tributyrin and on the media with rapeseed oil and Biodiesel oil additions, inhibition and stimulation of fungal growth was observed, respectively. Diesel oil did not affect the growth of these fungi. The growth and enzymatic activity of M. gypseum was found to be better than the growth and activity of T. ajelloi. Higher enzymatic activity can be associated with the pathogenicity of M. gypseum.

D016428 D013485 D013487 	Constitutive expression of the maltose fermentative enzymes in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis is dependent upon the mutational activation of a nonessential homolog of MAL63.	Maltose fermentation in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis is dependent upon the MAL6 locus. This complex locus is composed of the MAL61 and MAL62 genes, which encode maltose permease and maltase, respectively, and a third gene, MAL63, which codes for a trans-acting positive regulatory product. In wild-type strains, expression of the MAL61 and MAL62 mRNAs and proteins is induced by maltose and induction is dependent upon the MAL63 gene. Mutants constitutively expressing the MAL61 and MAL62 gene products have been isolated in mal63 backgrounds, and the mutations which have been analyzed map to a fourth MAL6-linked gene, MAL64. Cloning and characterization of this new gene are described in this report. The results revealed that the MAL64-C alleles present in constitutive strains encode a trans-acting positive function required for constitutive expression of the MAL61 and MAL62 gene products. In inducible strains, the MAL64 gene is dispensable, as deletion of the gene had no effect on maltose fermentation or maltose-regulated induction. MAL64 encoded transcripts of 2.0 and 1.4 kilobase pairs. While both MAL64 mRNAs were constitutively expressed in constitutive strains, they were maltose inducible in wild-type strains and induction was dependent upon the MAL63 gene. The MAL63 and MAL64 genes are at least partially structurally homologous, suggesting that they control MAL61 and MAL62 transcript accumulation by similar mechanisms. 
21750098	20110714	Glycobiology	D016428 D013485 	The GH18 family of chitinases: their domain architectures, functions and evolutions.	The glycoside hydrolase 18 (GH18) family of chitinases is a multigene family that plays various roles, such as ecdysis, embryonic development, allergic inflammation and so on. Efforts are still needed to reveal their functional diversification in an evolutionary and systematic manner. We collected 85 GH18 genes from eukaryotic representatives. The domain architectures of GH18 proteins were analyzed and several conserved patterns were identified. It was observed that some (11 proteins) GH18 members in Ecdysozoa or fungi possess repeats of catalytic domains and/or chitin-binding domains (ChtBs). The domain repeats are likely to meet requirements for higher efficiency of chitin degradation in chitin-containing species. On the contrary, all vertebrate GH18 proteins contain no more than one catalytic domain or ChtB. The results from homologous analysis, domain architectures, exon arrangements and synteny loci supported two evolutionary paths for the GH18 family. One path experienced gene expansion and contraction several times during evolution, covering most of GH18 members except CHID1 (stabilin-1 interacting partner) and its homologs. Proteins in this path underwent frequent domain gain and loss, as well as domain recombination, that could achieve versatility in function. The other path is comparatively conserved. The CHID1 gene evolved without gene duplication except in Danio rerio. Domain architectures of CHID1 orthologs are all identical. The diverse phylogeny of the GH18 family in arthropod is also presented. 
21865185	20110826	Clin._Infect._Dis.	D016428 D013485 	Early treatment with fluconazole may abrogate the development of IgG antibodies in coccidioidomycosis.	We have observed a number of patients who fail to develop coccidioidal complement fixing (CF) antibody (immunoglobulin [IgG]) after the initiation of early antifungal therapy. Although this is the first description of this phenomenon in mycology, a precedent for the abrogation of the immune response has been observed in other conditions, including primary syphilis and primary Lyme disease. We conducted a retrospective case-control study to determine any patient-specific risk factors associated with this observation. Additionally, in vitro analysis of the coccidioidal CF (IgG) antigen (Cts1) was performed after Coccidioides was grown under escalating fluconazole concentrations. Seventeen patients persistently positive for coccidioidal IgM antibodies without developing an IgG response (cases) were compared with 64 consecutive patients who did develop coccidioidal CF (IgG) antibodies (controls). Early treatment with antifungals (within 2 weeks of symptom onset) was associated with an abrogation of IgG antibody production (P < .001). With immunodiffusion testing, control serum demonstrated a lack of IgG seroreactivity when Coccidioides posadasii grown in the presence of escalating fluconazole doses (0.5-128 μg/mL) was used as the antigen; however, control serum remained seroreactive for the presence of IgM. The coccidioidal IgG antigen (Cts1) was shown to be diminished when cultures were grown in the presence of fluconazole, lending further in vitro plausibility to our findings. The abrogation of an IgG response in patients treated early in the course of coccidioidal infection may complicate serodiagnosis and epidemiologic studies, and further study to determine the potential clinical implications should be performed. 
2508563	19891101	Arch._Biochem._Biophys.	D016428 D013485 	Degradation of larchwood xylan by enzymes of a thermophilic fungus, Thermoascus aurantiacus.	Proteins from the culture filtrates of Thermoascus aurantiacus grown on paper were found to hydrolyze larchwood xylan completely to form xylose and 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucuronic acid. Partial hydrolysis of xylan by a xylanase purified from the culture filtrates resulted in the formation of neutral xylooligosaccharides of dp from 2 to 6 and acidic xylooligosaccharides of dp from 5 to 8. Each of these acidic sugars contained a single molecule of 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucuronic acid as a branch. Extensive hydrolysis of these oligosaccharides or xylan by xylanase led to the isolation of xylose, xylobiose, and an aldotetrauronic acid as terminal products. The structure of the aldotetrauronic acid was established by NMR as (2(2)-O-alpha-D,4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucurono)-xylotriose. A beta-glucosidase, also purified from the culture filtrates, hydrolyzed xylan and the neutral or the acidic xylooligosaccharides from the nonreducing end to release only xylose. Neither xylanase nor beta-glucosidase hydrolyzed the beta-(1----4) linkage between the xylose carrying the branch and the adjacent xylose residue on each side. 
2034221	19910401	Mol._Gen._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and characterization of a rice gene encoding a basic chitinase.	Chitinase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine linkages of the fungal cell wall polymer chitin, is involved in inducible defenses of plants. A basic chitinase genomic sequence was isolated from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic library using a bean chitinase gene fragment as a probe. The complete nucleotide sequence of the rice chitinase RCH10 gene was determined, and shown to contain an open reading frame with no introns, encoding a polypeptide of 336 amino acids. This polypeptide consists of a 21 amino acid signal peptide, a hevein domain, and a chitinase catalytic domain. The RCH10 gene has 63% identity at the nucleotide level and 75% identity at the amino acid level with chitinase genes from dicotyledonous plants such as bean, potato, and tobacco. A gene fusion of trpE and the coding region of RCH10 expressed in Escherichia coli gave a product that reacted with antiserum to bean chitinase, confirming the identity of RCH10 as a rice chitinase gene. Primer extension analysis identified two transcription start sites 53 bp and 55 bp upstream from the translation initiation codon. The 5' flanking region contains TATA and CAAT boxes, and the 3' region contains an AATAA polyadenylation signal. Southern blot hybridization indicated that there is a family of chitinase genes in the rice genome. Northern blot analysis showed that the RCH10 chitinase gene is induced in suspension cultured cells by a fungal cell wall elicitor. Rice chitinase transcripts accumulate to a high level in roots, but only low levels are found in stem and leaf tissue. 
8439291	19930215	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 D013487 	Disruption of the processing alpha-mannosidase gene does not prevent outer chain synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Processing of N-linked oligosaccharides in Saccharomyces cerevisiae begins with the removal of glucose and mannose residues from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to form a single isomer of Man8GlcNAc2. The importance of mannose removal for subsequent outer chain synthesis was examined in strains of S. cerevisiae disrupted in the MNS1 gene encoding a specific alpha 1,2-mannosidase responsible for Man8GlcNAc2 synthesis [Camirand, Heysen, Grondin and Herscovics (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15120-15127]. Both MNS1 transcripts of 1.85 kb and 1.7 kb were not observed in Northern blots of mns1 cells (i.e. cells containing the disrupted gene). Analysis on Bio-Gel P-6 of endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase-H-sensitive oligosaccharides following a 10 min pulse with [2-3H]mannose revealed similar amounts of labelled outer chains excluded from the gel in both control and mns1 cells. H.p.l.c. of the included oligosaccharides showed that a Man9GlcNAc, rather than a Man8GlcNAc, intermediate was formed in mns1 cells. Analysis of [3H]mannose-labelled core oligosaccharides from immunoprecipitated CPY and invertase by h.p.l.c. showed a similar size distribution in mns1 and control cells. Invertase immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labelled mns1 cells was highly glycosylated, but migrated slightly faster than that from control cells on denaturing PAGE, indicating a small difference in glycosylation. A similar difference in mobility was observed for invertase activity stain following non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. It is concluded that the alpha-mannosidase encoded by MNS1 is the only enzyme responsible for mannose removal in vivo, and that this processing step is not essential for outer chain synthesis. 
21590300	20110519	Microb._Ecol.	D003160 D016428 	The lignicolous fungus Coniochaeta pulveracea and its interactions with syntrophic yeasts from the woody phylloplane.	The yeast-like fungus Coniochaeta pulveracea was studied with regard to its novel lignocellulolytic activities and the possible effect thereof on yeasts from the woody phylloplane. An enrichment procedure was used to isolate C. pulveracea from a decaying Acacia tree, and the identity of the isolate was confirmed using morphology, as well as molecular and phylogenetic techniques. This isolate, as well as strains representing C. pulveracea from different geographical regions, were compared with regard to optimum growth temperature and enzyme activity to representatives of closely related species. These include strains of Coniochaeta boothii, Coniochaeta rhopalochaeta, and Coniochaeta subcorticalis. Plate assays for cellulase and xylanase activity indicated that all representatives of the above-mentioned species were able to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes and were also able to degrade birchwood toothpicks during a 50-day incubation period at 30°C. To test the ability of these fungi and their enzymes to release simple sugars from complex cellulosic substrates, filtrates obtained from liquid cultures of Coniochaeta, cultivated on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as sole carbon source, were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Consequently, the presence of mono- and disaccharides such as glucose and cellobiose was confirmed in these culture filtrates. Two subsequent experiments were conducted to determine whether these simple sugars released from woody material by Coniochaeta may enhance growth of phylloplane yeasts. In the first experiment, representatives of Coniochaeta were co-cultured with selected yeasts suspended in agar plates containing birchwood toothpicks, followed by examination of plates for colony formation. Results indicated that Coniochaeta growth on the toothpicks enhanced growth of nearby yeast colonies in the agar plates. In the second experiment, representatives of selected yeasts and Coniochaeta species were co-cultured on CMC and xylan-containing plates where after yeast colony formation was recorded on the plates. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, engineered to utilize specific wood degradation products, i.e., cellobiose or xylose, as sole carbon source were used as positive controls. While it was found that cellobiose released from CMC was assimilated by the yeasts, no evidence could be obtained that xylose released from xylan was used as carbon source by the yeasts. These ambiguous results could be ascribed to secretion of nutritious metabolic end products, other than the products of fungal xylanases. 
23167779	20121122	FEBS_J.	D016428 D013485 	Xylanase XYN IV from Trichoderma reesei showing exo- and endo-xylanase activity.	A minor xylanase, named XYN IV, was purified from the cellulolytic system of the fungus Trichoderma reesei Rut C30. The enzyme was discovered on the basis of its ability to attack aldotetraohexenuronic acid (HexA-2Xyl-4Xyl-4Xyl, HexA(3)Xyl(3)), releasing the reducing-end xylose residue. XYN IV exhibited catalytic properties incompatible with previously described endo-β-1,4-xylanases of this fungus, XYN I, XYN II and XYN III, and the xylan-hydrolyzing endo-β-1,4-glucanase EG I. XYN IV was able to degrade several different β-1,4-xylans, but was inactive on β-1,4-mannans and β-1,4-glucans. It showed both exo-and endo-xylanase activity. Rhodymenan, a linear soluble β-1,3-β-1,4-xylan, was as the best substrate. Linear xylooligosaccharides were attacked exclusively at the first glycosidic linkage from the reducing end. The gene xyn4, encoding XYN IV, was also isolated. It showed clear homology with xylanases classified in glycoside hydrolase family 30, which also includes glucanases and mannanases. The xyn4 gene was expressed slightly when grown on xylose and xylitol, clearly on arabinose, arabitol, sophorose, xylobiose, xylan and cellulose, but not on glucose or sorbitol, resembling induction of other xylanolytic enzymes from T. reesei. A recombinant enzyme prepared in a Pichia pastoris expression system exhibited identical catalytic properties to the enzyme isolated from the T. reesei culture medium. The physiological role of this unique enzyme remains unknown, but it may involve liberation of xylose from the reducing end of branched oligosaccharides that are resistant toward β-xylosidase and other types of endoxylanases. In terms of its catalytic properties, XYN IV differs from bacterial GH family 30 glucuronoxylanases that recognize 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) substituents as substrate specificity determinants.

22783068	20120712	Mycobiology	D016428 	Improvement of fungal cellulase production by mutation and optimization of solid state fermentation.	Spores of Aspergillus sp. SU14 were treated repeatedly and sequentially with Co(60) γ-rays, ultraviolet irradiation, and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. One selected mutant strain, Aspergillus sp. SU14-M15, produced cellulase in a yield 2.2-fold exceeding that of the wild type. Optimal conditions for the production of cellulase by the mutant fungal strain using solid-state fermentation were examined. The medium consisted of wheat-bran supplemented with 1% (w/w) urea or NH(4)Cl, 1% (w/w) rice starch, 2.5 mM MgCl(2), and 0.05% (v/w) Tween 80. Optimal moisture content and initial pH was 50% (v/w) and 3.5, respectively, and optimal aeration area was 3/100 (inoculated wheat bran/container). The medium was inoculated with 25% 48 hr seeding culture and fermented at 35℃ for 3 days. The resulting cellulase yield was 8.5-fold more than that of the wild type strain grown on the basal wheat bran medium. 
18266354	20080213	J_Phys_Chem_B	D016428 D013485 	Protein structure and dynamics in ionic liquids. Insights from molecular dynamics simulation studies.	We present in this work the first molecular simulation study of an enzyme, the serine protease cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi, in two ionic liquids (ILs): 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF6]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ([BMIM][NO(3)]). We tested different water contents in these ILs at room temperature (298 K) and high temperature (343 K), and we observe that the enzyme structure is highly dependent on the amount of water present in the IL media. We show that the enzyme is preferentially stabilized in [BMIM][PF6] at 5-10% (w/w) (weight of water over protein) water content at room temperature. [BMIM][PF6] renders a more nativelike enzyme structure at the same water content of 5-10% (w/w) as previously found for hexane, and the system displays a similar bell-shape-like dependence with the water content in the IL media. [BMIM][PF6] is shown to increase significantly the protein thermostability at high temperatures, especially at low hydration. Our analysis indicates that the enzyme is less stabilized in [BMIM][NO(3)] relative to [BMIM][PF6] at both temperatures, most likely due to the strong affinity of the [NO(3)]- anion toward the protein main chain. These findings are in accordance with the experimental knowledge for these two ionic liquids. We also show that these ILs "strip off" most of the water from the enzyme surface in a degree similar to that found for polar organic solvents such as acetonitrile, and that the remaining waters at the enzyme surface are organized in many small clusters. 
8757730	19960701	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 	The bglX gene located at 47.8 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome encodes a periplasmic beta-glucosidase.	A new Escherichia coli gene, bgIX, encoding a beta-D-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) has been characterized. The bgIX gene is located adjacent to the dld gene at 47.8 min or 2225 kb on the E. coli chromosome. The sequence of a 2.6 kb DNA fragment from this region revealed a large open reading frame encoding a protein of 765 amino acids. The BgIX protein was purified from the periplasm, and amino-terminal sequencing suggests that the mature protein is derived from cleavage of a 20 residue signal peptide. A search of the sequence databases revealed that BgIX is a member of a large family of beta-glucosidases from a variety of bacteria and fungi, and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. It differs from the other four E. coli phospho-beta-glucosidases in sequence and in its periplasmic rather than cytoplasmic location. The BgIX enzyme has a Km of 18 +/- 1 mM and a Vmax of 3 +/- 0.7 mumol min-1 for the colorimetric substrate o-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside. 
17031034	20061013	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Amino acid regions of family 45 endoglucanases involved in cotton defibrillation and in resistance to anionic surfactants and oxidizing agents.	In the detergent industry, fungal endoglucanases are used to release microfibrils from the surfaces of dyed cellulosic fabrics to enhance color brightness. Family 45 endoglucanase (glycoside hydrolase family 45, GH45) EGL3 from Humicola grisea is more resistant to anionic surfactants and oxidizing agents than family 45 endoglucanase RCE1 from Rhizopus oryzae, while in the present study, a catalytic domain of RCE1 had higher defibrillation activity on dyed cotton fabrics than did that of EGL3. To identify the amino acid regions involved in these properties, we compared the characteristics of RCE1, EGL3, and three chimeric endoglucanases, in which each of the three regions of the catalytic domain of EGL3 was replaced by the corresponding region of the catalytic domain of RCE1. Amino acids in the N-terminal region were involved in resistance to anionic surfactants and oxidizing agents. Furthermore, amino acids in the region adjacent to the N-terminal region were involved in releasing microfibrils and in binding to dyed cotton fabrics, indicating that the binding of the amino acids in this region might be important in the release of microfibrils from dyed cotton fabrics.

We have screened 766 strains of fungi from the BIOTEC Culture Collection (BCC) for xylanases working in extreme pH and/or high temperature conditions, the so-called extreme xylanases. From a total number of 32 strains producing extreme xylanases, the strain BCC7928, identified by using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence of rRNA to be a Marasmius sp., was chosen for further characterization because of its high xylanolytic activity at temperature as high as 90 degrees C. The crude enzyme possessed high thermostability and pH stability. Purification of this xylanase was carried out using an anion exchanger followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, yielding the enzyme with >90% homogeneity. The molecular mass of the enzyme was approximately 40 kDa. The purified enzyme retained broad working pH range of 4-8 and optimal temperature of 90 degrees C. When using xylan from birchwood as substrate, it exhibits Km and Vmax values of 2.6 +/- 0.6 mg/ml and 428 +/- 26 U/mg, respectively. The enzyme rapidly hydrolysed xylans from birchwood, beechwood, and exhibited lower activity on xylan from wheatbran, or celluloses from carboxymethylcellulose and Avicel. The purified enzyme was highly stable at temperature ranges from 50 to 70 degrees C. It retained 84% of its maximal activity after incubation in standard buffer containing 1% xylan substrate at 70 degrees C for 3 h. This thermostable xylanase should therefore be useful for several industrial applications, such as agricultural, food and biofuel. 
24039705	20130917	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 	The crystal structure of the core domain of a cellulose induced protein (Cip1) from Hypocrea jecorina, at 1.5 Å resolution.	In an effort to characterise the whole transcriptome of the fungus Hypocrea jecorina, cDNA clones of this fungus were identified that encode for previously unknown proteins that are likely to function in biomass degradation. One of these newly identified proteins, found to be co-regulated with the major H. jecorina cellulases, is a protein that was denoted Cellulose induced protein 1 (Cip1). This protein consists of a glycoside hydrolase family 1 carbohydrate binding module connected via a linker region to a domain with yet unknown function. After cloning and expression of Cip1 in H. jecorina, the protein was purified and biochemically characterised with the aim of determining a potential enzymatic activity for the novel protein. No hydrolytic activity against any of the tested plant cell wall components was found. The proteolytic core domain of Cip1 was then crystallised, and the three-dimensional structure of this was determined to 1.5 Å resolution utilising sulphur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing (sulphor-SAD). A calcium ion binding site was identified in a sequence conserved region of Cip1 and is also seen in other proteins with the same general fold as Cip1, such as many carbohydrate binding modules. The presence of this ion was found to have a structural role. The Cip1 structure was analysed and a structural homology search was performed to identify structurally related proteins. The two published structures with highest overall structural similarity to Cip1 found were two poly-lyases: CsGL, a glucuronan lyase from H. jecorina and vAL-1, an alginate lyase from the Chlorella virus. This indicates that Cip1 may be a lyase. However, initial trials did not detect significant lyase activity for Cip1. Cip1 is the first structure to be solved of the 23 currently known Cip1 sequential homologs (with a sequence identity cut-off of 25%), including both bacterial and fungal members.

The nucleotide sequence and derived amino acid sequence of two different beta-glucosidase cDNA clones were determined. One clone (TRE104) was identified as the cyanogenic beta-glucosidase by homology with the N-terminal and internal peptide amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. The biological function of the other beta-glycosidase (TRE361) is not known. Co-segregation of genomic restriction fragments uniquely identified by each cDNA clone shows that these two genes are linked in the white clover genome. Both TRE104 and TRE361 fragments co-segregate with cyanogenic beta-glucosidase activity. Extensive homology was found between the white clover beta-glucosidase sequences and a group of prokaryote and mammalian beta-glycosidases. This group of sequences has no homology with a separate set of beta-glucosidase genes isolated from fungi and the thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum. 
22982017	20120918	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Functional characterization and gene expression profiling of superoxide dismutase from plant pathogenic phytoplasma.	The rapid production of huge amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the responses of animal and plant cells induced under stress conditions, such as pathogenic bacterial infection. To protect against the cytotoxic ROS, it is important for pathogenic bacteria to inactivate ROS by employing their antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD). Here, we cloned and characterized the sodA gene from the plant pathogenic bacterium, 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris' OY-W strain. This is the first description of gene expression and antioxidant enzymatic activity of SOD from a phytoplasma. We also demonstrated the sodA gene product (OY-SOD) functions as Mn-type SOD. Since other Mollicutes bacteria such as mycoplasmas do not possess sodA probably due to reductive evolution, it is intriguing that phytoplasmas possess sodA despite their lack of many metabolic genes, suggesting that OY-SOD may play an important role in the phytoplasma colonization of plants and insects. Moreover, Western blot analysis and real-time PCR revealed that OY-SOD is expressed when the phytoplasma is grown in both plant and insect hosts, suggesting it is functioning in both hosts. Possible role of SOD in protection against damage by host-derived ROS is discussed. 
18852512	20081015	J._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification, characterization, and partial primary sequence of a major-maltotriose-producing alpha-amylase, ScAmy43, from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.	A novel alpha-amylase (alpha-1,4-alpha-D-glucan glucanohydrolase, E.C. 3.2.1.1), ScAmy43, was found in the culture medium of the phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum grown on oats flour. Purified to homogeneity, ScAmy43 appeared as a 43 kDa monomeric enzyme, as estimated by SDS-PAGE and Superdex 75 gel filtration. The MALDI peptide mass fingerprint of ScAmy43 tryptic digest as well as internal sequence analyses indicate that the enzyme has an original primary structure when compared with other fungal alpha- amylases. However, the sequence of the 12 N-terminal residues is homologous with those of Aspergillus awamori and Aspergillus kawachii amylases, suggesting that the new enzyme belongs to the same GH13 glycosyl hydrolase family. Assayed with soluble starch as substrate, this enzyme displayed optimal activity at pH 4 and 55oC with an apparent Km value of 1.66 mg/ml and Vmax of 0.1 micromol glucose x min-1 x ml-1. ScAmy43 activity was strongly inhibited by Cu2+, Mn2+, and Ba2+, moderately by Fe2+, and was only weakly affected by Ca2+ addition. However, since EDTA and EGTA did not inhibit ScAmy43 activity, this enzyme is probably not a metalloprotein. DTT and beta-mercaptoethanol strongly increased the enzyme activity. Starting with soluble starch as substrate, the end products were mainly maltotriose, suggesting for this enzyme an endo action. 
16487309	20060221	FEMS_Immunol._Med._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Chitinase from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis: molecular cloning, structural, phylogenetic, expression and activity analysis.	A full-length cDNA encoding a chitinase (Pbcts1) was cloned by screening a cDNA library from the yeast cells of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The cDNA consists of 1888 bp and encodes an ORF of 1218 bp corresponding to a protein of 45 kDa with 406 amino acid residues. The deduced PbCTS1 is composed of two signature family 18 catalytic domains and seems to belong to fungal/bacterial class. Phylogenetic analysis of PbCTS1 and other chitinases suggests the existence of paralogs of several chitinases to be grouped based on specialized functions, which may reflect the multiple and diverse roles played by fungi chitinases. Glycosyl hydrolase activity assays demonstrated that P. brasiliensis is able to produce and secrete these enzymes mainly during transition from yeast to mycelium. The fungus should be able to use chitin as a carbon source. The presence of an endocytic signal in the deduced protein suggests that it could be secreted by a vesicular nonclassical export pathway. The Pbcts1 expression in mycelium, yeast, during differentiation from mycelium to yeast and in yeast cells obtained from infected mice suggests the relevance of this molecule in P. brasiliensis electing PbCTS1 as an attractive drug target. 
8643441	19960514	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D003160 D016428 D013487 	Homologs of the Xenopus developmental gene DG42 are present in zebrafish and mouse and are involved in the synthesis of Nod-like chitin oligosaccharides during early embryogenesis.	The Xenopus developmental gene DG42 is expressed during early embryonic development, between the midblastula and neurulation stages. The deduced protein sequence of Xenopus DG42 shows similarity to Rhizobium Nod C, Streptococcus Has A, and fungal chitin synthases. Previously, we found that the DG42 protein made in an in vitro transcription/translation system catalyzed synthesis of an array of chitin oligosaccharides. Here we show that cell extracts from early Xenopus and zebrafish embryos also synthesize chitooligosaccharides. cDNA fragments homologous to DG42 from zebrafish and mouse were also cloned and sequenced. Expression of these homologs was similar to that described for Xenopus based on Northern and Western blot analysis. The Xenopus anti-DG42 antibody recognized a 63-kDa protein in extracts from zebrafish embryos that followed a similar developmental expression pattern to that previously described for Xenopus. The chitin oligosaccharide synthase activity found in extracts was inactivated by a specific DG42 antibody; synthesis of hyaluronic acid (HA) was not affected under the conditions tested. Other experiments demonstrate that expression of DG42 under plasmid control in mouse 3T3 cells gives rise to chitooligosaccharide synthase activity without an increase in HA synthase level. A possible relationship between our results and those of other investigators, which show stimulation of HA synthesis by DG42 in mammalian cell culture systems, is provided by structural analyses to be published elsewhere that suggest that chitin oligosaccharides are present at the reducing ends of HA chains. Since in at least one vertebrate system hyaluronic acid formation can be inhibited by a pure chitinase, it seems possible that chitin oligosaccharides serve as primers for hyaluronic acid synthesis. 
9701593	19980814	Plant_Physiol.	D016428 	Cutin monomers and surface wax constituents elicit H2O2 in conditioned cucumber hypocotyl segments and enhance the activity of other H2O2 elicitors 	Hypocotyls from etiolated cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings were gently abraded at their epidermal surface and cut segments were conditioned to develop competence for H2O2 elicitation. Alkaline hydrolysates of cutin from cucumber, tomato, and apple elicited H2O2 in such conditioned segments. The most active constituent of cucumber cutin was identified as dodecan-1-ol, a novel cutin monomer capable of forming hydrophobic terminal chains. Additionally, the cutin hydrolysates enhanced the activity of a fungal H2O2 elicitor, similar to cucumber surface wax, which contained newly identified alkan-1,3-diols. The specificity of elicitor and enhancement activity was further elaborated using some pure model compounds. Certain saturated hydroxy fatty acids were potent H2O2 elicitors as well as enhancers. Some unsaturated epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids were also excellent H2O2 elicitors but inhibited the fungal elicitor activity. Short-chain alkanols exhibited good elicitor and enhancer activity, whereas longer-chain alkan-1-ols were barely active. The enhancement effect was also observed for H2O2 elicitation by ergosterol and chitosan. The physiological significance of these observations might be that once the cuticle is degraded by fungal cutinase, the cutin monomers may act as H2O2 elicitors. Corrosion of cutin may also bring surface wax constituents in contact with protoplasts and enhance elicitation. 
16665750	19871101	Plant_Physiol.	D016428 	Elicitation of Necrosis in Vigna unguiculata Walp. by Homogeneous Aspergillus niger Endo-Polygalacturonase and by alpha-d-Galacturonate Oligomers.	Endo-polygalacturonase (PG) was purified from a commercial preparation of Aspergillus niger pectinase by means of carboxymethylcellulose chromatography, preparative isoelectric focusing, and gel permeation through Sephadex G-50. The enzyme was electrophoretically homogeneous and consisted of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 33,500. The enzyme exhibited a specific activity significantly higher than those of purified polygalacturonases from phytopathogenic fungi. Galacturonate oligomers with a degree of polymerization higher than four appeared quickly as products of the enzymic hydrolysis of Napolygalacturonate. The oligomers were later degraded to di- and monogalacturonate. The homogeneous enzyme and growing mycelium of Aspergillus niger separately elicited a necrotic response in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata Walp.) pods. Heat-inactivated PG and PG inactivated with specific antibodies did not elicit necrosis, suggesting that the catalytic activity of the enzyme is necessary for its function as an elicitor. The PG-released oligosaccharides from Vigna cell wall and the galacturonides with a degree of polymerization greater than four separately elicited necrosis, whereas di- and monogalacturonate did not. 
22447608	20120327	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Effects of airflow and changing humidity on the aerosolization of respirable fungal fragments and conidia of Botrytis cinerea.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the aerosolization of particles (micro- and macroconidia and fragments) from Botrytis cinerea cultures in relation to potential human inhalation in indoor environments. The influence of the following factors on the aerosolization of B. cinerea particles was studied: exposure to airflow, relative humidity (rh), changing rh, and plant or building materials. The aerodynamic diameter (d(a)) and the respirable fraction of the aerosolized particles were determined. Conidia and fragments of B. cinerea were not aerosolized as a response to a decrease in the rh. In contrast, both micro- and macroconidia and fungal fragments were aerosolized when exposed to an airflow of 1.5 m s(-1) or 0.5 m s(-1). Significantly more particles of microconidial size and fragment size were aerosolized at a low rh (18 to 40% rh) than at a higher rh (60 to 80% rh) when cultures were exposed to airflow. The size of the respirable fraction of the aerosolized particles was dependent on the rh but not on the growth material. At high rh, about 30% of the aerosolized particles were of respirable size, while at low rh, about 70% were of respirable size. During low rh, more fungal (1→3)-β-d-glucan and chitinase were aerosolized than during high rh. In conclusion, exposure to external physical forces such as airflow is necessary for the aerosolization of particles from B. cinerea. The amount and size distribution are highly affected by the rh, and more particles of respirable sizes were aerosolized at low rh than at high rh.

The lignocellulolytic fungus Aureobasidium pullulans NRRL Y 2311-1 produces feruloyl esterase activity when grown on birchwood xylan. Feruloyl esterase was purified from culture supernatant by ultrafiltration and anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and gel filtration chromatography. The pure enzyme is a monomer with an estimated molecular mass of 210 kDa in both native and denatured forms and has an apparent degree of glycosylation of 48%. The enzyme has a pI of 6.5, and maximum activity is observed at pH 6.7 and 60 degrees C. Specific activities for methyl ferulate, methyl p-coumarate, methyl sinapate, and methyl caffeate are 21.6, 35.3, 12.9, and 30.4 micro mol/min/mg, respectively. The pure feruloyl esterase transforms both 2-O and 5-O arabinofuranosidase-linked ferulate equally well and also shows high activity on the substrates 4-O-trans-feruloyl-xylopyranoside, O-[5-O-[(E)-feruloyl]-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl]-(1,3)-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1,4)-D-xylopyranose, and p-nitrophenyl-acetate but reveals only low activity on p-nitrophenyl-butyrate. The catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of the enzyme was highest on methyl p-coumarate of all the substrates tested. Sequencing revealed the following eight N-terminal amino acids: AVYTLDGD. 
22270691	20120125	Biodegradation	D016428 	Enhanced degradation of α-chitin materials prepared from shrimp processing byproduct and production of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine by thermoactive chitinases from soil mesophilic fungi.	Soil isolates of mesophilic Penicillium monoverticillium CFR 2, Aspergillus flavus CFR 10 and Fusarium oxysporum CFR 8 were cultivated in solid state fermentation (SSF) using wheat bran solid medium supplemented with α-chitin in order to produce chitinolytic enzyme. Under SSF cultivation, maximum enzymes (U/g IDS) production was 41.0 (endo-chitinase) and 195.4 (β-N-acetylhexosaminidase) by P. monoverticillium, 26.8 (endo-chitinase) and 222.1 (β-N-acetylhexosaminidase) by A. flavus and 13.3 (endo-chitinase) and 168.3 (β-N-acetylhexosaminidase) by F. oxysporum after 166 h of incubation. The crude endo-chitinase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase derived from A. flavus and F. oxysporum revealed optimum temperature at 62 ± 1°C, but the enzymes from P. monoverticillium showed optimum temperature at 52 ± 1°C for maximum activity. Several fold increase in endo-chitinase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activities in the crude enzymes preparation was achieved after concentrating with polyethylene glycol. The concentrated crude chitinases from P. monoverticillium, A. flavus and F. oxysporum, respectively yielded 95.6, 96.6 and 96.1 mmol/l of N-acetyl-D: -glucosamine (GlcNAc) in 48 h of reaction from colloidal chitin. While, the crude enzyme preparations of P. monoverticillium, A. flavus and F. oxysporum produced 10.11, 6.85 and 10.7 mmol/l of GlcNAc respectively, in 48 h of reaction from crystalline α-chitin. HPLC analysis of colloidal chitin hydrolysates prepared with crude chitinases derived from P. monoverticillium, A. flavus and F. oxysporum revealed that the major reaction product was monomeric GlcNAc (~80%) and a small amount of (GlcNAc)(4) (~20%), indicating the potential of these enzymes for efficient production of GlcNAc from α-chitin. 
16339718	20051213	Eukaryotic_Cell	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013486 	Envoy, a PAS/LOV domain protein of Hypocrea jecorina (Anamorph Trichoderma reesei), modulates cellulase gene transcription in response to light.	Envoy, a PAS/LOV domain protein with similarity to the Neurospora light regulator Vivid, which has been cloned due to its lack of expression in a cellulase-negative mutant, links cellulase induction by cellulose to light signaling in Hypocrea jecorina. Despite their similarity, env1 could not compensate for the lack of vvd function. Besides the effect of light on sporulation, we observed a reduced growth rate in constant light. An env1(PAS-) mutant of H. jecorina grows significantly slower in the presence of light but remains unaffected in darkness compared to the wild-type strain QM9414. env1 rapidly responds to a light pulse, with this response being different upon growth on glucose or glycerol, and it encodes a regulator essential for H. jecorina light tolerance. The induction of cellulase transcription in H. jecorina by cellulose is enhanced by light in the wild-type strain QM9414 compared to that in constant darkness, whereas a delayed induction in light and only a transient up-regulation in constant darkness of cbh1 was observed in the env1(PAS-) mutant. However, light does not lead to cellulase expression in the absence of an inducer. We conclude that Envoy connects the light response to carbon source signaling and thus that light must be considered an additional external factor influencing gene expression analysis in this fungus.

Cellobiose oxidase from the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been purified to homogeneity by a new method. The enzyme has been cleaved by papain into two fragments: one containing the heme group and one containing the flavin group. The flavin fragment can oxidize cellobiose and is reoxidized by oxygen. Cellobiose oxidase binds to cellulose to approximately the same extent as cellobiohydrolase I. The cellulose-binding site is located on the flavin domain. The enzyme cannot be totally displaced from cellulose by cellobiose, and it is still active when adsorbed to cellulose. The possible role of the enzyme in lignocellulose degradation is discussed.

D1 was purified to 52.3-fold by ion exchange chromatography using SP Sepharose. Maximum enzyme activity was recorded at pH 5.0 and 50 °C. MALDI-LC-MS/MS analysis identified the purified enzyme as chitinase with 60% similarity to chitinase Chi55 of Paenibacillus ehimensis. The activation energy (E (a)) for chitin hydrolysis and temperature quotient (Q (10)) at optimum temperature was found to be 19.14 kJ/mol and 1.25, respectively. Determination of kinetic constants k (m), V (max), k (cat), and k (cat)/k (m) and thermodynamic parameters ΔH*, ΔS*, ΔG*, ΔG*(E-S), and ΔG*(E-T) revealed high affinity of the enzyme for chitin. The enzyme exhibited higher stability in presence of commonly used protectant fungicides Captan, Carbendazim, and Mancozeb compared to control as reflected from the t (1/2) values suggesting its applicability in integrated pest management for control of soil-borne fungal phytopathogens. The order of stability of chitinase in presence of fungicides at 80 °C as revealed from t (1/2) values and thermodynamic parameters E (a(d)) (activation energy for irreversible deactivation), ΔH*, ΔG*, and ΔS* was: Captan > Carbendazim > Mancozeb > control. The present study is the first report on thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of chitinase from Paenibacillus sp. D1. 
16578829	19880201	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 	Several "pathogenesis-related" proteins in potato are 1,3-beta-glucanases and chitinases.	Chitinase {poly[1,4-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide)]glycanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.14} and 1,3-beta-glucanase (1,3-beta-D-glucan 3-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.6) activities increased rapidly in potato (Solanum tuberosum) leaves inoculated with the pathogenic fungus Phytophthora infestans or treated with fungal elicitor. The enzyme activities were resolved into a total of two distinct 1,3-beta-glucanases and six proteins with chitinase activity. By several criteria, all of these proteins are classified as "pathogenesis-related" proteins whose biochemical functions have so far been unknown. Some of them constitute a major portion of the proteins accumulating in the intercellular space of infected potato leaves and are assumed to play an important role in pathogen defense.

Black rot of sweet potato caused by pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata severely deteriorates both growth of plants and post-harvest storage. Antimicrobial peptides from various organisms have broad range activities of killing bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Plant thionin peptide exhibited anti-fungal activity against C. fimbriata. A gene for barley α-hordothionin (αHT) was placed downstream of a strong constitutive promoter of E12Ω or the promoter of a sweet potato gene for β-amylase of storage roots, and introduced into sweet potato commercial cultivar Kokei No. 14. Transgenic E12Ω:αHT plants showed high-level expression of αHT mRNA in both leaves and storage roots. Transgenic β-Amy:αHT plants showed sucrose-inducible expression of αHT mRNA in leaves, in addition to expression in storage roots. Leaves of E12Ω:αHT plants exhibited reduced yellowing upon infection by C. fimbriata compared to leaves of non-transgenic Kokei No. 14, although the level of resistance was weaker than resistance cultivar Tamayutaka. Storage roots of both E12Ω:αHT and β-Amy:αHT plants exhibited reduced lesion areas around the site inoculated with C. fimbriata spores compared to Kokei No. 14, and some of the transgenic lines showed resistance level similar to Tamayutaka. Growth of plants and production of storage roots of these transgenic plants were not significantly different from non-transgenic plants. These results highlight the usefulness of transgenic sweet potato expressing antimicrobial peptide to reduce damages of sweet potato from the black rot disease and to reduce the use of agricultural chemicals.

D003160 D016428 	Intracellular and extracellular production of proteins in Aspergillus under the control of expression signals of the highly expressed Aspergillus nidulans gpdA gene.	The expression in Aspergillus is described of genes, coding for intracellular and extracellular proteins controlled by the promoter region of the constitutively and efficiently expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gpdA) of Aspergillus nidulans. Both the homologous gpdA and the heterologous Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (lacZ) and beta-glucuronidase (uidA) genes could be expressed intracellularly at levels as high as 10-25% of total soluble protein. Efficient extracellular production of A. niger glucoamylase could be achieved with a fusion-gene containing the region of the glucoamylase gene coding for the mature protein preceded by a synthetic fungal signal sequence. Extracellular production of a heterologous protein, E. coli beta-glucuronidase, with such a fusion was much less efficient. Only very low levels of beta-glucuronidase were detected in the culture fluid, whereas considerable enzyme activity was detected in the mycelium. 
24179680	20131102	Allergy_Asthma_Immunol_Res	D016428 D016454 	Diagnosis and management of grain-induced asthma.	Grain-induced asthma is a frequent occupational allergic disease mainly caused by inhalation of cereal flour or powder. The main professions affected are bakers, confectioners, pastry factory workers, millers, farmers, and cereal handlers. This disorder is usually due to an IgE-mediated allergic response to inhalation of cereal flour proteins. The major causative allergens of grain-related asthma are proteins derived from wheat, rye and barley flour, although baking additives, such as fungal α-amylase are also important. This review deals with the current diagnosis and treatment of grain-induced asthma, emphasizing the role of cereal allergens as molecular tools to enhance diagnosis and management of this disorder. Asthma-like symptoms caused by endotoxin exposure among grain workers are beyond the scope of this review. Progress is being made in the characterization of grain and bakery allergens, particularly cereal-derived allergens, as well as in the standardization of allergy tests. Salt-soluble proteins (albumins plus globulins), particularly members of the α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family, thioredoxins, peroxidase, lipid transfer protein and other soluble enzymes show the strongest IgE reactivities in wheat flour. In addition, prolamins (not extractable by salt solutions) have also been claimed as potential allergens. However, the large variability of IgE-binding patterns of cereal proteins among patients with grain-induced asthma, together with the great differences in the concentrations of potential allergens observed in commercial cereal extracts used for diagnosis, highlight the necessity to standardize and improve the diagnostic tools. Removal from exposure to the offending agents is the cornerstone of the management of grain-induced asthma. The availability of purified allergens should be very helpful for a more refined diagnosis, and new immunomodulatory treatments, including allergen immunotherapy and biological drugs, should aid in the management of patients with this disorder.

In carbon-depleted cultures of Penicillium chrysogenum, age-related chitinases were shown to play a crucial role in both autolysis and fragmentation as indicated by in vivo enzyme inhibition experiments using allosamidin. This pseudotrisaccharide even hindered significantly the outgrowth of new hyphal tips from the surviving yeastlike fragments after glucose supplementation. The antifungal effect of allosamidin on autolyzing P. chrysogenum mycelia was fungistatic rather than fungicidal. In growing hyphae, membrane-bound microsomal chitinase zymogen(s) were detected, which may be indicative of some compartmentalization of these hydrolases. Later, during autolysis, no zymogenic chitinase was detected in any enzyme fraction studied, including microsomes. These observations may explain the different sensitivity of growing and autolyzing mycelia to allosamidin. Chitinases taking part in the age-related fragmentation of hyphae and the outgrowth of surviving hyphal fragments seem to be potent targets for future antifungal drug research.

Lipid accumulation abilities of two endophytic fungal isolates - Colletotrichum sp. and Alternaria sp. grown under optimum and nutrient-stress conditions were investigated and compared. Significant variations in lipid contents, ranging from 30% to 58% of their dry biomass were found in liquid culture using various carbon sources. Since, >50% of the total lipid was estimated to be neutral lipid for both the fungal species, predicted biodiesel properties were theoretically calculated based upon the determined fatty acid profiles; and the values were found to be comparable to those of commonly used plant oils for biodiesel production. The two endophytes grew successfully on the combined rice straw and wheat bran as substrate that was degraded by their secretory enzymes including cellulase [1.21-2.51 FPU/g dry substrate (gds)] in solid state fermentation and produced substantial amount of lipid (60.32-84.30 mg/gds). Our study highlights the potential utilities of these two novel endophytic fungi as biodiesel feedstock.

Real-time PCR assays based on TaqMan chemistry have been developed for the detection and quantification of Botrytis cinerea, suitable for a wide range of different host plant species. Assays were designed to the beta-tubulin gene, the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA and also to a previously published, species-specific sequence characterised amplified region (SCAR) marker; the assays were compared to a published method based on SYBR Green I technology. The assays designed to the IGS region and SCAR marker proved to be highly specific for B. cinerea but assays designed to the beta-tubulin gene and the previously published assay designed to the cutinase-A gene both cross-react with B. fabae. The assay designed to the IGS region was the most sensitive and was able to reliably detect and quantify as little as 20 fg of B. cinerea DNA. The method incorporates the detection of a gene from the plant host to compensate for variations in extraction efficiency and size of sample tested. The assays designed were used to follow the progression of infection of B. cinerea in plant material inoculated with spores to the point of symptom induction. They should be ideally suited to investigating infection processes in-planta and could be used to investigate aspects of infection/plant pathogenesis, by B. cinerea and are particularly suited to the detection and quantification of the pathogen prior to the development of symptoms.

Maltose fermentation in Saccharomyces species requires the presence of at least one of five unlinked MAL loci: MAL1, MAL2, MAL3, MAL4 and MAL6. Each MAL locus is complex consisting of at least three genes: a trans-acting activator, a maltose permease, and maltase. All the MAL loci show homology to each other both at the sequence level as determined by Southern transfer analysis and at the functional level as determined by complementation. We describe the organization of the MAL loci in yeast and the basic features of their regulation. The analysis of MAL has contributed to our understanding of the evolution of multigenic families, the global integration of carbohydrate metabolism, and gene regulation.

18371173	20080329	FEMS_Microbiol._Rev.	D016428 D013485 D016454 	Degradation of cellulose by basidiomycetous fungi.	Cellulose is the main polymeric component of the plant cell wall, the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth, and an important renewable resource. Basidiomycetous fungi belong to its most potent degraders because many species grow on dead wood or litter, in environment rich in cellulose. Fungal cellulolytic systems differ from the complex cellulolytic systems of bacteria. For the degradation of cellulose, basidiomycetes utilize a set of hydrolytic enzymes typically composed of endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase and beta-glucosidase. In some species, the absence of cellobiohydrolase is substituted by the production of processive endoglucanases combining the properties of both of these enzymes. In addition, systems producing hydroxyl radicals based on cellobiose dehydrogenase, quinone redox cycling or glycopeptide-based Fenton reaction are involved in the degradation of several plant cell wall components, including cellulose. The complete cellulolytic complex used by a single fungal species is typically composed of more than one of the above mechanisms that contribute to the utilization of cellulose as a source of carbon or energy or degrade it to ensure fast substrate colonization. The efficiency and regulation of cellulose degradation differs among wood-rotting, litter-decomposing, mycorrhizal or plant pathogenic fungi and yeasts due to the different roles of cellulose degradation in the physiology and ecology of the individual groups.

The ability of metabolites contained in culture liquid of 62 strains of marine fungi to affect the activity of two digestive enzymes of marine mollusks--endo-1,3-beta-D-glucanase of Spisula sachalinensis and beta-D-glucosidase of Littorina kurila--was studied. It was found that 66 and 71% of specimens activated, 18 and 7% inhibited, and 16 and 22% did not affect the activity of endo-1,3-beta-D-glucanase and beta-D-glucosidase, respectively. It is demonstrated that the metabolites of brown algae and marine sponges can be used for a targeted regulation of enzyme biosynthesis by marine fungi. The protein inhibitor of endo-1,3-beta-D-glucanases isolated from the brown alga Laminaria cichorioides blocked the biosynthesis of almost all O-glycosylhydrolases in five strains of marine fungi studied. The presence in culture medium of halistanol sulfate from the marine sponge of the family Halichondriidae either did not affect or activated the biosynthesis of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism by marine fungi.

Cellulose hydrolysis by immobilized Trichoderma reesei cellulase in the presence of a low viscosity ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate (EMIM-DEP), was investigated. Preparation of the carrier-free immobilized cellulase was optimized with respect to concentration of the cross-linker and the type of precipitant. The addition of 2% (v/v) EMIM-DEP during hydrolysis gave an initial reaction rate 2.7 times higher than the hydrolysis rate with no ionic liquid. The initial yield after 2 h was 0.7 g glucose/g cellulose, and the carrier-free immobilized cellulase (CFIC) was effectively re-used five times.

The polyadenylated 3' ends of eukaryotic mRNA transcripts enables the use of oligo(dT) primers for cDNA synthesis, but this can result in the overrepresentation of the 3' end of transcripts in cDNA pools. In an effort to increase the uniformity of transcripts represented in cDNA pools, random hexamers have been used. The use of both priming methods is abundant in the literature, but we do not know how these methods perform relative to each other. We performed comparative richness and compositional analyses of the fungal glycosyl hydrolase family 7 cellobiohydrolase I gene cbhI amplified from soil cDNAs that had been generated using either oligo(dT) primers or random hexamers. Our results demonstrate that similar cbhI richness and composition were recovered using both approaches. Richness estimates and compositional profiles of cbhI sequence libraries generated from random hexamer-primed cDNA were more variable than from libraries generated from oligo(dT) primed cDNA. However, our overall results indicate that, on average, comparable richness and composition were recovered from soil cDNAs when either priming method was used. 
21686190	20110621	Int_J_Mol_Sci	D016428 D013485 	Expression of an endo-β-1,4-glucanase gene from orpinomyces PC-2 in Pichia pastoris.	The endo-β-1,4-glucanase gene celE from the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces PC-2 was placed under the control of an alcohol oxidase promoter (AOX1) in the plasmid pPIC9K, and integrated into the genome of a methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation. The strain with highest endo-β-1,4-glucanase activity was selected and designed as P. pastoris egE, and cultivated in shaking flasks. The culture supernatant was assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and showed a single band at about 52 kDa. Furthermore, the recombinant P. pastoris egE was proved to possess the ability to utilize sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a carbon source. The recombinant endoglucanase produced by P. pastoris showed maximum activity at pH 6.0 and temperature 45 °C, indicating it was a mesophilic neutral endo-β-1,4-glucanase, suitable for denim biofinishing/washing. Further research was carried out in suitable fermentation medium in shaking flasks. The most favorable methanol addition concentration was discussed and given as 1.0%. After methanol induction for 96 h, the endo-β-1,4-glucanase activity reached 72.5 IU mL(-1). This is the first report on expression and characterization of endo-β-1,4-glucanase from Orpinomyces in P. pastoris. The endo-β-1,4-glucanase secreted by recombinant P. pastoris represents an attractive potential for both academic research and textile industry application. 
16797931	20060627	Res._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Functional characterization of a novel hydrocarbonoclastic Pseudomonas sp. strain PUP6 with plant-growth-promoting traits and antifungal potential.	A novel hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium was isolated from rice rhizospheric soil using an enrichment culture technique. Detailed taxonomic studies identified the organism, designated strain PUP6, as a member of the genus Pseudomonas. The bacterium grew in minimal medium amended with n-alkane members of hydrocarbons, n-dodecane (C12H26), n-hexadecane (C16H34), n-octadecane (C18H38), n-octacosane (C28H58); and petroleum fractions such as crude oil and lubricating oil when provided as sole carbon and energy source. Degradation of these n-alkane hydrocarbons and oils in minimal salts medium by strain PUP6 was estimated using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. In addition to its hydrocarbonoclastic properties, this bacterium exhibits a broad spectrum of fungal antibiosis against various phytopathogenic fungi. An antifungal metabolite produced by strain PUP6 was isolated, characterized and identified as phenazine-1-carboxamide on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopic analyses. Strain PUP6 also produced plant-growth-promoting siderophores, indoleacetic acid (IAA), phosphate solubilizing enzymes, and fungal cell wall degrading enzymes such as protease and chitinase. This study can be considered as the first report on n-alkane hydrocarbon and oil degradation by a rhizosphere soil bacterium that exhibits biofertilizing and biocontrol traits. Due to its innate multiple functional traits beyond its role in degradation of hydrocarbons, strain PUP6 may be used as plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium and biocontrol agent against phytopathogenic fungi. 
4269376	19730801	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 	Activity and heat stability of trehalase from the mycelium and ascospores of Neurospora.	Trehalases from the ascospores of Neurospora tetrasperma and the mycelium of N. crassa were compared. Enzymes from both sources have identical electrophoretic mobilities, K(m)'s, responses to pH, immunological reactions, and activities in low-molarity buffers. Because both enzymes are so similar, conclusions about the properties of the ascospore enzyme may, be made by studying mycelial trehalase. Mycelial trehalase is most active and stable in low-molarity buffers. The enzyme exists in at least three species; the smallest has a molecular weight between 105,000 and 125,000 and is predominant in low-molarity buffers at 37 C. The stability of trehalase to heating at 65 C can be increased by increasing enzyme concentration and by the addition of polyols. Ascospores contain large amounts of trehalose, which protects trehalase from heat inactivation at 65 C. The importance of this phenomenon in vivo and its relationship to the localization of trehalase in ascospores is discussed. 
2155864	19900101	Food_Chem._Toxicol.	D016428 	Effect of patulin on microbicidal activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages.	Patulin, a fungal metabolite shown previously to exert immunosuppressive effects on the cellular and humoral immune systems, was examined for its in vitro effects on some functions of murine peritoneal macrophages. The cells were pre-incubated for 2 hr with mycotoxin concentrations of 0.01-2 micrograms/ml. Phagocytosis and phagosome-lysosome fusion were diminished above 0.1 microgram patulin/ml and lysosomal enzymes and microbicidal activity above 0.5 microgram/ml, whereas O2- production was inhibited only above 2 micrograms/ml. This indicated that the killing mechanism did not depend on products of the oxidative burst. The concentrations used did not decrease the cell viability. Under natural circumstances, patulin may constitute a health risk for animals. 
17651154	20070727	Clin._Exp._Allergy	D016428 D013485 	Optimized methods for fungal alpha-amylase airborne exposure assessment in bakeries and mills.	In order to enable reproducible and comparable exposure measurements of fungal alpha-amylase (alpha-amylase) in different laboratories and countries, the entire procedure from sampling of airborne dust to measuring extracted samples (including standards and the used enzyme) immunoassays must be standardized. The aim of this study was to establish optimal elution and assay conditions. A parallel sampler was used for simultaneous collection of 10 samples of inhalable dust in bakeries and mills in Germany, England, the Netherlands and Spain. Three enzyme-immunoassays (EIAs) for detection of fungal alpha-amylase based on monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies were used for the measurement of the parallel-sampled filters (n=432) extracted using several methods. The results were analysed by regression analysis of variance. Additional filters (n=54) were extracted and analysed using two EIAs to investigate the storage stability of the extracts. Although alpha-amylase concentrations correlated well (r> or =0.88), differences were found between the EIAs in the sensitivity and nominal values (up to a mean factor 5.8). The best elution medium for airborne filters (phosphate-buffered saline 'PBS' with 0.05% Tween-20) led to 1.2 to two times higher alpha-amylase allergen yields than extraction in PBS only, while higher Tween-20 concentrations decreased the extracted alpha-amylase yield. During storage of frozen dust/filter extracts for 3-4 months at -20 degrees C, a loss of approximately 40% of measurable alpha-amylase was observed, which could be partially prevented by addition of 0.1% casein to the medium directly after extraction. Although the effects of only a few of many possible causes of variation were investigated, for these factors a clear choice could be made with regard to optimal elution conditions and the use of validated EIAs with calibrated standards, thus making significant progress towards a completely standardized procedure for airborne alpha-amylase measurements. 
18216571	20080125	Cornea	D016428 	Chitinase levels in the tears of subjects with ocular allergies.	Chitin is abundant in the structural coatings of fungi, insects, and parasitic nematodes. The host defense against chitin-containing pathogens includes production of chitinases. An acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is produced in human epithelial cells of lower airways through a TH2-specific, interleukin-13-dependent pathway and appears to be associated with allergic asthma. The role of AMCase in allergic ocular pathologies has never been studied previously. Six patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), 7 patients with season allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), and 8 healthy controls (4 children and 4 adults) were enrolled in this study. AMCase activity was measured in tears, RNA was extracted from epithelial cells of the conjunctiva, and AMCase mRNA expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. AMCase activity was increased in patients affected by VKC (33.7 +/- 10.8 nmol/mL/h) and SAC (7.3 +/- 4.1 nmol/mL/h) compared with healthy controls (1.6 +/- 0.2 nmol/mL/h), and AMCase activity was higher in subjects with VKC (P = 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity were 100%, addressing the use of AMCase assay in the biochemical diagnosis of VKC and SAC. AMCase mRNA was detected in epithelial cells of the conjunctiva, and the expression was significantly higher in VKC and SAC. AMCase may be an important mediator in the pathogenesis of TH2 inflammation eye diseases, suggesting a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in these pathologies. 
1869562	19910815	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 	A Dictyostelium discoideum cellulase is a member of a spore germination-specific gene family.	A member of the 270 spore germination-specific gene family in Dictyostelium discoideum is shown to encode a cellulase (endo-(1,4)-beta-D-glucanase, EC 3.2.1.4) activity. The 270-6 deduced protein shows 38% identity and 58% similarity to an avocado (Persea americana) cellulase. During spore germination in Dictyostelium extracellular cellulase activity starts to accumulate coincident with the appearance of the 270-6 gene transcript. Amoebae transformed by a vector containing the 270-6 mRNA sequence express an extracellular cellulase during vegetative growth when there would otherwise be no cellulase activity. In addition, the expression of a truncated 270-6 polypeptide lacking the 270 gene family-defining tetrapeptide repeat and the C-terminal region, in suitably transformed amoebae, also produces an extracellular cellulase activity. Several differently sized cellulase activities are shown to accumulate during spore germination, and it is possible that the 270 gene family represents a coordinately expressed family of cellulases. 
18574585	20080625	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Three endochitinase-encoding genes identified in the biocontrol fungus Clonostachys rosea are differentially expressed.	Three endochitinase-encoding genes, cr-ech58, cr-ech42 and cr-ech37 were identified and characterised from the mycoparasitic C. rosea strain IK726. The endochitinase activity was specifically induced in media containing chitin or Fusarium culmorum cell walls as sole carbon sources. RT-PCR analysis showed that the three genes were differentially expressed. The expression of the cr-ech42 and cr-ech37 genes was triggered by F. culmorum cell walls and chitin whereas glucose repressed their expression. In contrast, the expression of cr-ech58 was not triggered by F. culmorum cell walls and chitin, suggesting a different role for this endochitinase. Phylogenetically, the cr-ech42 and cr-ech37 genes showed to be orthologous to endochitinase 42 and 37 kDa encoding genes from other mycoparasitic fungi, while no orthologous gene for the cr-ech58 gene was found. Three genetically modified mutants of C. rosea were made by disruption of the endochitinase genes via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and their biocontrol activity was evaluated. While in planta bioassays showed no significant difference in biocontrol efficacy between the disruptants and the wildtype, the real time RT-PCR analysis showed that disruption of each endochitinase gene affected the activity of C. rosea during interaction with F. culmorum in liquid cultures. 
12652902	20030326	DNA_Seq.	D016428 	The major component of the cellulosomes of anaerobic fungi from the genus Piromyces is a family 48 glycoside hydrolase.	Sequencing of two cDNAs from the anaerobic fungi Piromyces equi and Piromyces sp. strain E2 revealed that they both encode a glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 48 cellulase, containing two C-terminal fungal dockerin domains. N-terminal sequencing of the major component of the Piromyces multi-enzyme cellulase/hemicellulase complex, termed the cellulosome, showed that these 80 kDa proteins corresponded to the GH family 48 enzyme. These data show for the first time that GH family 48 cellulases are not confined to bacteria, and that bacterial and fungal cellulosomes share the same pivotal component. 
22579384	20120515	Enzyme_Microb._Technol.	D016428 	Interactions between fungal growth, substrate utilization and enzyme production during shallow stationary cultivation of Phanerochaete chrysosporium on cotton stalks.	Microbial pretreatment of lignocellulosic feedstocks is an environment friendly alternative to physio-chemical pretreatment methods. A better understanding of the interactive fungal mechanisms in biological systems is essential for enhancing performance and facilitating scale-up and commercialization of this pretreatment technique. In this study, mathematical models were developed for describing cellulose and hemicellulose consumption, lignin degradation, cellulase and ligninolytic enzyme production and oxygen uptake associated with the growth of Phanerochaete chrysosporium during a 14-day shallow stationary submerged fungal pretreatment process on cotton stalks. Model parameters were estimated and validated by Statistics Toolbox in MatLab 7.1. Models yielded sufficiently accurate predictions for cellulose and hemicellulose consumption (R²=0.9772 and 0.9837), lignin degradation (R²=0.9879 and 0.8682) and ligninolytic enzyme production (R²=0. 8135 and 0.9693) under both 1-day and 3-day oxygen flushing conditions, respectively. The predictabilities for fungal growth (R²=0.6397 and 0.5750) and cellulase production (R²=0.0307 and 0.3046) for 1-day and 3-day oxygen flushing, respectively, and oxygen uptake (R²=0.5435) for 3-day oxygen flushing were limited.

Aureobasidium pullulans strain Y117 was transformed to hygromycin resistance using plasmid pDH33, which contains the bacterial hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hph) fused to promoter elements of the Aspergillus niger glucoamylase gene (glaA). Southern hybridizations of transformants revealed multiple, integrated copies of the vector. The glaA promoter was not induced by starch in A. pullulans as it is in A. niger; however, the transcriptional start points were the same in both species. 
15166216	20040529	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Structural basis for inhibition of Aspergillus niger xylanase by triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor-I.	Plants developed a diverse battery of defense mechanisms in response to continual challenges by a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms. Their defense arsenal includes inhibitors of cell wall-degrading enzymes, which hinder a possible invasion and colonization by antagonists. The structure of Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor-I (TAXI-I), a first member of potent TAXI-type inhibitors of fungal and bacterial family 11 xylanases, has been determined to 1.7-A resolution. Surprisingly, TAXI-I displays structural homology with the pepsin-like family of aspartic proteases but is proteolytically nonfunctional, because one or more residues of the essential catalytical triad are absent. The structure of the TAXI-I. Aspergillus niger xylanase I complex, at a resolution of 1.8 A, illustrates the ability of tight binding and inhibition with subnanomolar affinity and indicates the importance of the C-terminal end for the differences in xylanase specificity among different TAXI-type inhibitors. 
2178175	19901001	J._Dairy_Sci.	D016428 D016454 	Role of rumen fungi in fiber degradation.	Anaerobic fungi inhabit the rumen and actively degrade plant cell walls. Rumen fungi produce high levels of cellulases and hemicellulases and are particularly proficient in producing xylanases. These enzymes are regulated by substrate (especially soluble sugars) available to the organisms. Fungi degrade unlignified (i.e., no histochemical reaction for phenolics) plant walls totally, indicating that enzymes are able to hydrolyze or solubilize the entire plant wall. These organisms are better able to colonize and degrade the lignin-containing tissues than are bacteria; phenolics are solubilized but not metabolized from the plant wall by fungi. Anaerobic fungi are unique among rumen microorganisms in that they penetrate the cuticle. Residues after incubation with fungi are physically weaker than those incubated with whole rumen fluid or with rumen bacteria, suggesting that fungi could alter the fibrous residue for easier mastication by the animal. Data indicate that cocultures of anaerobic fungi with methanogenic bacteria stimulate cellulose degradation; other data suggest that fungi are inhibited by certain rumen microorganisms. The interaction of rumen fungi with other organisms in relation to fiber degradation in the rumen requires additional study. Rumen fungi have the potential to degrade the more recalcitrant plant walls in forages, but this potential is not always reached in the rumen. 
22092890	20111119	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Evaluation of the catalase promoter for expressing the alkaline xylanase gene (alx) in Aspergillus niger.	Aspergillus niger represents a promising host for the expression of recombinant proteins, but only a few expression systems are available for this organism. In this study, the inducible catalase promoter (PcatR) from A. niger was characterized. For this, constructs were developed and checked for the expression of the alkaline xylanase gene transcriptionally fused under the cat R promoter. Two versions of the catalase (catR) promoter sequence from A. niger (P(cat300,) P(cat924)) were isolated and tested for their ability to drive expression of the alkaline xylanase (alx) gene. P(cat924) showed better efficiency (more than 10-fold increase in AlX activity compared to P(cat300)) under the optimized culture conditions. Induction of the catR promoter with 0.20% H(2)O(2) and 1.5% CaCO(3) in the culture medium, further increased expression of AlX 2.61- and 2.20-fold, respectively, clarifying its inducible nature. Specific induction or repression of the catR promoter provides the possibility for utilization of this promoter in heterologous protein production. 
11514096	20010822	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 	Effect of tunicamycin on N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase produced by Trichoderma harzianum.	The effect of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation, was studied in non-growing mycelium of Trichoderma harzianum induced to secrete N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine. Tunicamycin (30 microg ml(-1)) had no significant effect on growth of the fungus, or on the total protein secreted or specific activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. However, in the presence of the inhibitor an underglycosylated form of the enzyme was produced. The apparent molecular masses for this and the native enzyme were 110 and 124 kDa, respectively. Both forms of the enzyme showed the same optimum pH and temperature, but the underglycosylated form was more sensitive to inactivation by both high temperature (60 degrees C) and the proteolytic enzyme trypsin. 
19189178	20090204	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Identification and characterization of a chitinase-produced bacillus showing significant antifungal activity.	Strain MY75 is a gram-positive, aerobic, endospore-forming bacterium that can secrete high levels of extracellular chitinase (4.645 U/ml) when chitin powder exists as an inducer. This strain was identified as Bacillus licheniformis using the Biolog MicroLog microbial identification system and sequence analysis of 16S rDNA, gyrA and rpoB genes. Strain MY75 has the ability to inhibit the growth of Gibberella saubinetii and Aspergillus niger, two major pathogenic fungi in agriculture, and to restrain their spore germination completely. The chitinase was proved to play an important role in the strain's antifungal activity. 
2729975	19890401	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 	Production of xylanase by the ruminal anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix frontalis.	Xylanase (1,4-beta-D-xylan xylanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.8) production was investigated in the ruminal anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix frontalis. The enzyme was released principally into the culture fluid and had pH and temperature optima of 5.5 and 55 degrees C, respectively. In the presence of low concentrations of substrate, the enzyme was stabilized at 50 degrees C. Xylobiose was the principal product of xylanase action, with lesser amounts of longer-chained xylooligosaccharides. No xylose was detected, indicating that xylobiase activity was absent. Activities of xylanase up to 27 U ml-1 (1 U represents 1 micromol of xylose equivalents released min-1) were obtained for cultures grown on xylan (from oat spelt) at 2.5 mg ml-1 in shaken cultures. No growth occurred in unshaken cultures. Xylanase production declined with elevated concentrations of xylan (less than 2.5 mg ml-1), and this was accompanied by an accumulation of xylose and, to a lesser extent, arabinose. Addition of either pentose to cultures grown on low levels of xylan in which neither sugar accumulated suppressed xylanase production, and in growth studies with the paired substrates xylan-xylose, active production of the enzyme occurred during growth on xylan only after xylose had been preferentially utilized. When cellobiose, glucose, and xylose were tested as growth substrates for the production of xylanase (each initially at 2.5 mg ml-1), they were found to be less effective than xylan, and use of xylan from different origins (birch wood or larch wood) as the growth substrate or in the assay system resulted in only marginal differences in enzyme activity. However, elevated production of xylanase occurred during growth on crude hemicellulose (barley straw leaf). The results are discussed in relation to the role of the anaerobic fungi in the ruminal ecosystem, and the possible application of the enzyme in bioconversion processes is also considered. 
10447589	19990814	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487 	Functional domain analysis of the Saccharomyces MAL-activator.	MAL63 of the MAL6 locus and its homologues at the other MAL loci encode transcription activators required for the maltose-inducible expression of the MAL structural genes. We carried out a deletion analysis of LexA-MAL63 gene fusions to localize the functional domains of the Mal63 MAL-activator protein. Our results indicate that the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of Mal63p is contained in residues 1-100; that residues 60-283 constitute a functional core region including the transactivation domain; that residues 251-299 are required to inhibit the activation function of Mal63p; and that the rest of the C-terminal region of the protein contains a maltose-responsive domain that acts to relieve the inhibitory effect on the activation function. Abundant overproduction of Mal63p does not overcome the negative regulation of MAL gene expression in the absence of maltose, suggesting that a titratable MAL-specific repressor similar to Gal80p is not involved in the negative regulation of the MAL-activator. A model for maltose-inducible autoregulation of the MAL-activator is presented.

Thirteen chromosomal-sized DNA bands of the cultivated mushroom Agaricus bisporus have been resolved using the method of clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis. Using chromosome size standards from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, the estimated size of the chromosomal DNAs ranged from 3.5 to 1.2 megabase pairs (Mb). By Southern hybridization with homologous gene probes, the chromosomal location of cellulase and laccase genes have been mapped. In addition, rDNA has been assigned to chromosomal bands using a heterologous gene probe. Genomic rearrangement is suggested in the commercial heterokaryon, as indicated by the presence of non-comigrating homologous chromosomes, identified by a number of probes for particular DNA sequences.

The deduced amino acid sequence of A. oryzae csnA indicates extensive similarities to those of other fungal chitosanases. 
17655689	20070728	FEMS_Yeast_Res.	D016428 D013485 	A novel vector element providing multicopy vector integration in Arxula adeninivorans.	An Arxula adeninivorans vector element has been identified that provides multicopy integration in an atrp1 host strain. The element consists of the ATRP1 selection marker fused to a newly generated truncated ALEU2 promoter of 53 bp. In the described example eight copies of an amyA expression vector encoding heterologous alpha-amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are integrated in the genome of the recombinant strain instead of a single copy observed when using the ATRP1 element with the complete promoter. The high copy number results in strains of superior productivity for a secreted recombinant alpha-amylase. The vector design enables the integration of a small vector fragment that consists of yeast DNA only providing high transformation frequencies and a high mitotic stability.

Mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPT3 gene were previously found to cause suppression of Ty and delta insertion mutations in 5'-noncoding regions of genes. This suppression likely results from the fact that SPT3 is required for transcription initiation in delta sequences. Other additional phenotypes of spt3 mutants, including a mating defect, suggest that SPT3 is required for normal levels of expression of other genes. We analyzed the mating defect in spt3 mutants and showed that the levels of transcripts of the three major mating pheromone genes, MF alpha 1, MFa1, MFa2, were all reduced. The reduction in expression of these genes in spt3 mutants was not due to expression of a silent mating type cassette. Furthermore, we showed that the spt3 mating defect was manifest at the levels of both cellular fusion and nuclear fusion. 
12507000	20030101	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of beta-1,6-glucanase of Streptomyces rochei application in the study of yeast cell wall proteins.	A beta-1,6-glucanase was purified to apparent homogeneity from a commercial yeast digestive enzyme prepared from Streptomyces rochei by a series of column chromatographies. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 60 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme had an optimum pH range from 4.0 to 6.0 and was stable in the same pH range. The enzyme was stable under 50 degrees C but lost almost all activity at 60 degrees C. The enzyme was specific to beta-1,6-glucan and had little activity towards beta-1,3-glucan and beta-1,4-glucan. When the beta-1,6-glucan was hydrolyzed with the purified enzyme for 5 h, the reaction products contained 20% glucose, 36% gentiobiose, and 44% other oligosaccharides, suggesting that the enzyme is an endo-type glucanase. When the purified enzyme was used for the digestion of the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell-wall proteins covalently bound to the cell-wall glucan were recovered as soluble forms, suggesting that this enzyme is useful for analysis of yeast-cell wall proteins. 
18457422	20080507	Biochemistry	D016428 	Three-dimensional structure of an intact glycoside hydrolase family 15 glucoamylase from Hypocrea jecorina.	The three-dimensional structure of a complete Hypocrea jecorina glucoamylase has been determined at 1.8 A resolution. The presented structure model includes the catalytic and starch binding domains and traces the course of the 37-residue linker segment. While the structures of other fungal and yeast glucoamylase catalytic and starch binding domains have been determined separately, this is the first intact structure that allows visualization of the juxtaposition of the starch binding domain relative to the catalytic domain. The detailed interactions we see between the catalytic and starch binding domains are confirmed in a second independent structure determination of the enzyme in a second crystal form. This second structure model exhibits an identical conformation compared to the first structure model, which suggests that the H. jecorina glucoamylase structure we report is independent of crystal lattice contact restraints and represents the three-dimensional structure found in solution. The proposed starch binding regions for the starch binding domain are aligned with the catalytic domain in the three-dimensional structure in a manner that supports the hypothesis that the starch binding domain serves to target the glucoamylase at sites where the starch granular matrix is disrupted and where the enzyme might most effectively function. 
15304740	20040812	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Enzyme production and profile by Aspergillus niger during solid substrate fermentation using palm kernel cake as substrate.	The oil palm sector is one of the major plantation industries in Malaysia. Palm kernel cake is a byproduct of extracted palm kernel oil. Mostly palm kernel cake is wasted or is mixed with other nutrients and used as animal feed, especially for ruminant animals. Recently, palm kernel cake has been identified as an important ingredient for the formulation of animal feed, and it is also exported especially to Europe, South Korea, and Japan. It can barely be consumed by nonruminant (monogastric) animals owing to the high percentages of hemicellulose and cellulose contents. Palm kernel cake must undergo suitable pretreatment in order to decrease the percentage of hemicellulose and cellulose. One of the methods employed in this study is fermentation with microorganisms, particularly fungi, to partially degrade the hemicellulose and cellulose content. This work focused on the production of enzymes by Aspergillus niger and profiling using palm kernel cake as carbon source. 
8488724	19930301	Yeast	D016428 D013485 	Reduced efficiency in the glycosylation of the first sequon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exoglucanase leads to the synthesis and secretion of a new glycoform of the molecule.	In addition to exoglucanases (EXGs) I and II, old cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae secreted into the culture medium a new immunologically-related material that exhibited exoglucanase activity. The new exoglucanase (EXGII1/2) was purified from stationary-phase cultures. It turned out to be a glycoprotein whose protein portion was identical to that of the other two isoenzymes in terms of ionic properties, size, amino acid composition and NH2-terminal sequence (25 residues). Disruption of the structural gene encoding EXGs I and II resulted in a strain unable to secrete all three isoenzymes. EXGII1/2 was indistinguishable in terms of molecular weight from the single intermediate detected during the deglycosylation (mediated by endo H) of EXGII by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thus, the new isoenzyme contains only one of the two slightly elongated mannan inner cores present in enzyme II. Two intermediates were, however, detected when the deglycosylation of EXGII was monitored by ion-exchange chromatography (high-pressure liquid chromatography). Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the major intermediate, which eluted at about the same position as enzyme II1/2, corresponded to protein molecules carrying the oligosaccharide attached to the Asn of the second sequon, whereas the minor one carried the oligosaccharide in the first potential glycosylation site. Several lines of evidence indicate that EXGII1/2 is a biosynthetic product resulting from an imbalance between the rate of protein synthesis and the glycosylation capabilities of the glycosylation machinery.

D016428 	Colloidal Gold Cytochemistry of Endo-1,4-beta-Glucanase, 1,4-beta-D-Glucan Cellobiohydrolase, and Endo-1,4-beta-Xylanase: Ultrastructure of Sound and Decayed Birch Wood.	Colloidal gold coupled to endo-1,4-beta-glucanase II (EG II) and 1,4-beta-D-glucan cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I), isolated from Trichoderma reesei (QM9414), and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from Aureobasium pullulans (NRRLY-2311-1) was used successfully to determine the ultrastructural localization of cellulose and xylan in sound birch wood. In addition, these enzyme-gold complexes demonstrated the distribution of cellulose and xylan after decay by three white rot fungi, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Phellinus pini, and Trametes versicolor, and one brown rot fungus, Fomitopis pinicola. Transverse sections of sound wood showed that EG II was localized primarily on the S(1) layer of the secondary wall, whereas CBH I labeled all layers of the secondary wall. Oblique sections showed a high concentration of gold labeling, using EG II or CBH I. Preference for the sides of the microfibrillar structure was observed for both EG II and CBH I, whereas only CBH I had a specificity for the cut ends of microfibrils. Labeling with the xylanase-gold complex occurred primarily in the inner regions of the S(2) layer, S(1), and the middle lamella. In contrast, little labeling occurred in the middle lamella with EG II or CBH I. Intercellular regions within the cell corners of the middle lamella were less electron dense and labeled positively when EG II- and xylanase-gold were used. Wood decayed by P. chrysosporium or P. pini was delignified, and extensive degradation of the middle lamella was evident. The remaining secondary walls labeled with EG II and CBH I, but little labeling was found with the xylanase-gold complex. Wood decayed by T. versicolor was nonselective, and erosion of all cell wall layers was apparent. Remaining wall layers near sites of erosion labeled with both EG II and CBH I. Erosion troughs that reached the S(1) layer or the middle lamella had less xylanase-gold labeling in the adjacent cell wall that remained. Brown-rotted wood had very low levels of gold particles present in sections treated with EG II or xylanase. Labeling with CBH I had the lowest concentrations in the S(2) layer near cell lumina and corresponded to sites with the most extensive degradation.

The genome of the cellulolytic fungus Penicillium janthinellum BIOURGE was resolved completely by rotating field electrophoresis. The gel pattern revealed 8-10 different chromosomes. On the basis of data for yeast chromosome size standards from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromosome sizes in the range from 2.0 to 8 mb were estimated. By Southern hybridization with heterologous probes, the chromosomal locations of rDNA, the elongation factor EF1, actin and ubiquitin have all been mapped. In addition, first results with heterologous and homologous probes for cellulolytic genes from Trichoderma reesei and P. janthinellum are presented. In contrast to the other probes, signals obtained with cellulase genes are clearly distributed over several chromosomes. 
11589578	20011009	Mol._Genet._Genomics	D016428 D013485 	The Hypocrea jecorina HAP 2/3/5 protein complex binds to the inverted CCAAT-box (ATTGG) within the cbh2 (cellobiohydrolase II-gene) activating element.	The 5' regulatory region of the chh2 gene, encoding cellobiohydrolase II, of the filamentous fungus Hypocrea jecorina contains the cbh2 activating element (CAE) which is essential for cbh2 expression. The CAE consists of two separate, adjacent motifs, a CCAAT box on the template strand (ATTGG) and a GTAATA box on the coding strand, which co-operate in the induction of the gene by cellulose or sophorose. EMSA supershift experiments using an antibody against Aspergillus nidulans HAPC suggested that the complex which binds to the H. jecorina CCAAT box contains a HAPC homolog. To obtain direct evidence for this, we have cloned the hap2, hap3 and hap5 genes from H. jecorina. They encode proteins whose core regions display great similarity to Aspergillus HAPB, HAPC and HAPE and to known HAP homologs from other organisms. All three genes are transcribed in a carbon source-independent manner. A. nidulans deltahap strains were functionally complemented in vitro by the overexpressed H. jecorina HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5 proteins, and they thus represent subunits of the CCAAT-binding complex. Furthermore, all three proteins (HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5) were needed to bind to the CAE in the H. jecorina cbh2 gene promoter in vitro. We conclude that the CCAAT box on the template strand in CAE is bound by the H. jecorina equivalent of the HAP protein complex. 
11212916	20010224	Mol._Gen._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	Transcriptional regulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae amino acid permease gene BAP2.	Uptake of branched-chain amino acids by Saccharomyces cerevisiae from media containing a preferred nitrogen source is mediated by the permeases encoded by BAP2, BAP3, and VAP1/TAT1. The transcriptional activity of the BAP2 promoter is affected by a number of genes, including SSY1, which encodes an amino acid permease homologue that is necessary for transcription of BAP2. Other genes that control BAP2 encode known (Leu3p, Tup1p) and putative (Stp1p, Stp2p) transcription factors. We present evidence that the zinc-finger proteins Stp1p and Stp2p bind directly to the BAP2 promoter. Binding of Stplp to the BAP2 promoter in vivo and in vitro indicates that the STP gene family indeed encodes transcription factors. The presence of a Leu3p binding site in the BAP2 promoter is required for full promoter activity on synthetic complete medium. The capacity of Leu3p to activate BAP2 transcription correlates with conditions that affect the level of alpha-isopropyl malate. The effect of a tup1 deletion on BAP2 transcription depends on SSY1. In an ssy1 strain, the phenotype of tup1 conforms to the well-established role of Tup1p as part of a repressor complex, but in the SSY1 strain deletion of TUP1 causes a decrease in transcription, indicating that Tup1p may also have an activating role at the BAP2 promoter. Our results thus suggest a complex interplay between several transcription factors in the expression of BAP2. 
17215902	20070112	Can._J._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Expression regulation of the endochitinase-encoding gene sechi44 from the mycoparasite Stachybotrys elegans.	The regulation of the gene encoding the extracellular chitinase sechi44 produced by the mycoparasite Stachybotrys elegans was studied using real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Alteration of sechi44 expression was observed when S. elegans was in interaction with its host, Rhizoctonia solani, and also when the mycoparasite was grown on minimal media amended with different carbon and nitrogen sources. Direct contact with R. solani leading to mycoparasitism significantly up-regulated the expression of sechi44, although the analysis showed that sechi44 was constitutively expressed but at substantially lower levels. In addition, the study of sechi44 over 12 days showed that its expression followed a cyclical pattern with peaks every 2 days, which suggests that this gene has a role not only in mycoparasitism but also in growth. The addition of external carbon sources, such as N-acetylglucosamine, chitin, and R. solani cell wall (simulated mycoparasitism), triggered an increase in the expression of sechi44, which varied with time and carbon source. Among the carbon sources examined, N-acetylglucosamine induced the highest increase in sechi44 transcript levels. The addition of high concentrations of glucose and ammonium triggered a decrease of sechi44 expression, suggesting that sechi44 is subject to glucose and ammonium repression. 
16871939	20060729	Am_J_Rhinol	D016428 D013485 	Increased expression of acidic mammalian chitinase in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.	Chitin is an abundant polysaccharide found in fungi, insects, and parasitic nematodes. Innate immune host defense against chitin-containing pathogens include production of chitinases. In human lower airways, acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is produced in epithelial cells via a Th2-specific, IL-13-dependent pathway, and may act as an inflammatory mediator in asthma. The role of AMCase in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has not been studied previously. Eleven controls and 22 subjects with medically recalcitrant CRS were prospectively enrolled before undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. RNA was extracted from surgically obtained ethmoid mucosa, and real-time PCR was used to determine expression of AMCase, eotaxin, and IL-13. Subjects were followed for at least 6 months postoperatively to assess for polyp recurrence. Based on the presence or absence of polyps, the subjects were classified as either recalcitrant or responsive to therapy. AMCase mRNA was detected in the sinus mucosa of 72% of control subjects and in 72% of patients with eosinophilic CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). The expression of AMCase was significantly greater in recalcitrant CRSwNP than it was in treatment-responsive CRSwNP. There was no significant difference in IL-13 expression between these two groups. AMCase may be an important mediator in the pathogenesis of Th2 inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. Failure of medical and surgical therapy in CRSwNP is associated with significantly increased expression of AMCase, but not the Th2 cytokines IL-13 and eotaxin. Additional studies are needed to determine the potential of AMCase as a therapeutic target in CRSwNP. 
21048871	20101105	Enzyme_Res	D016428 	High-Yield Endoglucanase Production by Trichoderma harzianum IOC-3844 Cultivated in Pretreated Sugarcane Mill Byproduct.	The low-cost production of cellulolytic complexes presenting high action at mild conditions and well-balanced cellulase activities is one of the major bottlenecks for the economical viability of the production of cellulosic ethanol. In the present paper, the filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum IOC-3844 was used for the production of cellulases from a pretreated sugarcane bagasse (namely, cellulignin), by submerged fermentation. This fungal strain produced high contents of endoglucanase activity (6,358 U·L(-1)) after 72 hours of process, and further relevant β-glucosidase and FPase activities (742 and 445 U·L(-1), resp.). The crude enzyme extract demonstrated appropriate characteristics for its application in cellulose hydrolysis, such as high thermal stability at up to 50°C, accessory xylanase activity, and absence of proteolytic activity towards azocasein. This strain showed, therefore, potential for the production of complete cellulolytic complexes aiming at the saccharification of lignocellulosic materials.

A copy of the cutinase cDNA from Fusarium solani pisi was constructed starting from synthetic oligonucleotides.

Heterologous expression of the synthetic cutinase gene and the subsequent secretion of the recombinant enzyme was achieved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus awamori. 
15128512	20040507	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D023362 D016428 D013485 	Improved production of heterologous proteins by a glucose repression-defective mutant of Kluyveromyces lactis.	The secreted production of heterologous proteins in Kluyveromyces lactis was studied. A glucoamylase (GAA) from the yeast Arxula adeninivorans was used as a reporter protein for the study of the secretion efficiencies of several wild-type and mutant strains of K. lactis. The expression of the reporter protein was placed under the control of the strong promoter of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among the laboratory strains tested, strain JA6 was the best producer of GAA. Since this strain is known to be highly sensitive to glucose repression and since this is an undesired trait for biomass-oriented applications, we examined heterologous protein production by using glucose repression-defective mutants isolated from this strain. One of them, a mutant carrying a dgr151-1 mutation, showed a significantly improved capability of producing heterologous proteins such as GAA, human serum albumin, and human interleukin-1beta compared to the parent strain. dgr151-1 is an allele of RAG5, the gene encoding the only hexokinase present in K. lactis (a homologue of S. cerevisiae HXK2). The mutation in this strain was mapped to nucleotide position +527, resulting in a change from glycine to aspartic acid within the highly conserved kinase domain. Cells carrying the dgr151-1 allele also showed a reduction in N- and O-glycosylation. Therefore, the dgr151 strain may be a promising host for the production of heterologous proteins, especially when the hyperglycosylation of recombinant proteins must be avoided. 
573944	19790101	Zentralbl_Bakteriol_Naturwiss	D016428 	Preparation and properties of pectic enzymes produced by Trichoderma lignorum.	Polygalacturonase and protein-methylesterase were isolated from shaken culture of Trichoderma lignorium. Isolation was carried out with various agents. Methanol was the most suitable precipitant for isolating polygalacturonase, yielding enzyme preparations 6.6 times more active than that of culture filtrate. Likewise, tannin afforded active fractions at pH 4 and 0.05% concentrations. Similarly, 50% ammonium sulphate saturation gave active fractions. The least polygalacturonase activity was obtained from ethanol. In any of the organic solvents used, highest enzymic activity was obtained when using only one volume. As regards pectin-methylesterase, no correlation existed between its activity and concentration of the precipitant used. A substrate concentration above 0.8% was a limiting factor for polygalacturonase activity, while optimum enzyme concentration was 40 microgram protein/ml at 40 degrees C and pH 4.45. 
15312766	20040818	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	The structure of endo-beta-1,4-galactanase from Bacillus licheniformis in complex with two oligosaccharide products.	The beta-1,4-galactanase from Bacillus licheniformis (BLGAL) is a plant cell-wall-degrading enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of beta-1,4-galactan in the hairy regions of pectin. The crystal structure of BLGAL was determined by molecular replacement both alone and in complex with the products galactobiose and galactotriose, catching a first crystallographic glimpse of fragments of beta-1,4-galactan. As expected for an enzyme belonging to GH-53, the BLGAL structure reveals a (betaalpha)(8)-barrel architecture. However, BLGAL betaalpha-loops 2, 7 and 8 are long in contrast to the corresponding loops in structures of fungal galactanases determined previously. The structure of BLGAL additionally shows a calcium ion linking the long betaalpha-loops 7 and 8, which replaces a disulphide bridge in the fungal galactanases. Compared to the substrate-binding subsites predicted for Aspergillus aculeatus galactanase (AAGAL), two additional subsites for substrate binding are found in BLGAL, -3 and -4. A comparison of the pattern of galactan and galactooligosaccharides degradation by AAGAL and BLGAL shows that, although both are most active on substrates with a high degree of polymerization, AAGAL can degrade galactotriose and galactotetraose efficiently, whereas BLGAL prefers longer oligosaccharides and cannot hydrolyze galactotriose to any appreciable extent. This difference in substrate preference can be explained structurally by the presence of the extra subsites -3 and -4 in BLGAL.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of grape stalks, an agroindustrial waste, for growth and lignocellulolytic enzyme production via solid-state fermentation, using the following three white rot fungi: Trametes trogii, Stereum hirsutum and Coriolus antarcticus. The decolorization of several dyes by the above mentioned cultures was also investigated. Similar values of dry weight loss of the substrate were measured after 60 days (33-43 %). C. antarcticus produced the highest laccase and Mn-peroxidase activities (33.0 and 1.6 U/g dry solid). The maximum endoglucanase production was measured in S. hirsutum cultures (10.4 U/g), while the endoxylanase peak corresponded to T. trogii (14.6 U/g). The C. antarcticus/grape stalk system seems potentially competitive in bioremediation of textile processing effluents, attaining percentages of decolorization of 93, 86, 82, 82, 77, and 58% for indigo carmine, malachite green, azure B, remazol brilliant blue R, crystal violet and xylidine, respectively, in 5 h. 
8952478	19961203	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 	Structure of the Fusarium oxysporum endoglucanase I with a nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue: substrate distortion gives rise to the preferred axial orientation for the leaving group.	Endoglucanase I (EG I) is a cellulase, from glycosyl hydrolase family 7, which cleaves the beta-1,4 linkages of cellulose with overall retention of configuration. The structure of the EG I from Fusarium oxysproum, complexed to a nonhydrolyzable thiooligosaccharide substrate analogue, has been determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.7 A utilizing the 4-fold noncrystallographic symmetry present in the asymmetric unit. The electron density map clearly reveals the presence of three glucosyl units of the inhibitor, consistent with the known number of sugar-binding subsites, located at the active site of the enzyme in the -2, -1, and +1 subsites, i.e., actually spanning the point of enzymatic cleavage. The pyranose ring at the point of potential enzymatic cleavage is clearly distorted from the standard 4C1 chair as was originally suggested for beta-retaining enzymes by Phillips [Ford, L.O., Johnson, L.N., Machin, P. A., Phillips, D.C., & Tijan, T. (1974) J. Mol. Biol, 88, 349-371]. The distortion observed goes beyond the "sofa" conformation observed in previous studies and results in a conformation whose salient feature is the resulting quasi-axial orientation for the glycosidic bond and leaving group, as predicted by stereoelectronic theory. An almost identical conformation has recently been observed in a complex of chitobiase with its unhydrolyzed substrate [Tews, I., Perrakis, A., Oppenheim, A., Dauter, Z., Wilson, K. S., & Vorgias, C. E. (1996) Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 638-648]. The striking similarity between these two complexes extends beyond the almost identical pyranose ring distortion. The overlap of the two respective sugars places the enzymatic nucleophile of endoglucanase I in coincidence with the C2 acetamido oxygen of N-acetylglucosamine in the catalytic site of the chitobiase, substantiating the involvement of this group in the catalytic mechanism of chitobiase and related chitinolytic enzymes. The endoglucanase I complex with the thiosaccharide substrate analogue clearly illustrates the potential of nonhydrolyzable sulfur-linked oligosaccharides in the elucidation of substrate binding and catalysis by glycosyl hydrolases. 
1936989	19911101	Genes_Dev.	D016428 D013485 D013487 	The yeast RME1 gene encodes a putative zinc finger protein that is directly repressed by a1-alpha 2.	In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a/alpha cells can enter meiosis whereas a and alpha cells cannot. The a/alpha cell type is determined by presence of a repressor, a1-alpha 2. Previous studies indicate that a/alpha cells lack an inhibitor of meiosis, the RME1 gene product, and that a and alpha cells express RME1. We report here the sequence of RME1 and functional analysis of its regulatory and coding regions. The 5'-region of RME1 includes a sequence resembling a1-alpha 2 repression sites. Deletion of this site at RME1 relieves repression by a1-alpha 2, and insertion of the site into a heterologous regulatory region (CYC1) confers weak repression in a/alpha cells. These observations indicate that RME1 is directly repressed by a1-alpha 2. The RME1 product has three regions that resemble C2H2 zinc fingers, which are characteristic of a class of nucleic-acid-binding proteins. Substitution of serine for cysteine in each of the putative fingers abolishes RME1 function; serine substitutions in the second and third putative fingers do not affect RME1 stability. These findings indicate that at least two putative zinc fingers are critical for RME1 structure or activity. Therefore RME1, which is formally a negative regulator of the meiotic gene IME1, may act directly as a repressor. 
17869267	20070918	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 	Characterization of a double dockerin from the cellulosome of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces equi.	The assembly into supramolecular complexes of proteins having complementary activities is central to cellular function. One such complex of considerable biological and industrial significance is the plant cell wall-degrading apparatus of anaerobic microorganisms, termed the cellulosome. A central feature of bacterial cellulosomes is a large non-catalytic protein, the scaffoldin, which contains multiple cohesin domains. An array of digestive enzymes is incorporated into the cellulosome through the interaction of the dockerin domains, present in the catalytic subunits, with the cohesin domains that are present in the scaffoldin. By contrast, in anaerobic fungi, such as Piromyces equi, the dockerins of cellulosomal enzymes are often present in tandem copies; however, the identity of the cognate cohesin domains in these organisms is unclear, hindering further biotechnological development of the fungal cellulosome. Here, we characterise the solution structure and function of a double-dockerin construct from the P. equi endoglucanase Cel45A. We show that the two domains are connected by a flexible linker that is short enough to keep the binding sites of the two domains on adjacent surfaces, and allows the double-dockerin construct to bind more tightly to cellulosomes than a single domain and with greater coverage. The double dockerin binds to the GH3 beta-glucosidase component of the fungal cellulosome, which is thereby identified as a potential scaffoldin.

In filamentous fungi, most of the strategies used for the improvement of protein yields have been based on an increase in the transcript levels of a target gene. Strategies focusing at the translational level have been also described, but are far less explored. Here the 5' untranslated sequence of the glaA mRNA, a widely used expression system for the expression of recombinant proteins, was modified by the introduction of different nucleotide elements that have positive role in the translation process. Five Aspergillus niger laccase-like multicopper oxidases (MCOs) coding genes were fused to the native glaA 5'UTR and the three synthetic versions (sUTR1, sUTR2, and sUTR3) as well, and placed under the control of the glucoamylase gene promoter. Afterwards, a total of 20 fungal transformations were done using A. niger N593 as a recipient strain and 50 transformants per transformation were isolated and analyzed. The result of the incorporation of the synthetic 5'UTRs on the overall productivity of the transformants was assessed, on one hand by monitoring the laccase activity of all the isolated transformants, and on the other hand by quantifying and comparing the activity of those secreting the highest level of each MCO. For this purpose, a high-throughput method for the screening and selection of the best producers was developed. Once the best transformants producing the highest yield of McoA, McoB, McoC, McoD, and McoJ laccases were selected, their production level was quantified in supernatants of liquid cultures. The results obtained in this work indicate that modifications in the native glaA 5'UTR can lead to improvements in protein yields.

Orange peels is the principal solid by-product of the citrus processing industry and the disposal of the fresh peels is becoming a major problem to many factories. Dry citrus peels are rich in pectin, cellulose and hemicellulose and may be used as a fermentation substrate. Production of multienzyme preparations containing pectinolytic, cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes by the mesophilic fungi Aspergillus niger BTL, Fusarium oxysporum F3, Neurospora crassa DSM 1129 and Penicillium decumbens under solid-state fermentation (SSF) on dry orange peels was enhanced by optimization of initial pH of the culture medium and initial moisture level. Under optimal conditions A. niger BTL was by far the most potent strain in polygalacturonase and pectate lyase, production followed by F. oxysporum F3, N. crassa DSM 1129 and P. decumbens. N. crassa DSM 1129 produced the highest endoglucanase activity and P. decumbens the lowest one. Comparison of xylanase production revealed that A. niger BTL produced the highest activity followed by N. crassa DSM 1129, P. decumbens and F. oxysporum F3. N. crassa DSM 1129 and P. decumbens did not produce any beta-xylosidase activity, while A. niger BTL produced approximately 10 times more beta-xylosidase than F. oxysporum F3. The highest invertase activity was produced by A. niger BTL while the lowest ones by F. oxysporum F3 and P. decumbens. After SSF of the four fungi, under optimal conditions, the fermented substrate was either directly exposed to autohydrolysis or new material was added, and the in situ produced multienzyme systems were successfully used for the partial degradation of orange peels polysaccharides and the liberation of fermentable sugars. 
9345767	19971105	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Function and regulation of the acid and neutral trehalases of Mucor rouxii.	Two different trehalose-hydrolysing activities, known as acid or non-regulatory trehalases, and neutral or regulatory trehalases, have been recognised in a number of fungal species. The true role of these apparently redundant hydrolases remained obscure for many years. However, recent evidence suggests that neutral trehalases would be specialised in the mobilisation of cytosolic trehalose, while acid trehalases would only hydrolyse extracellular trehalose. Results obtained with Mucor rouxii, a Zygomycete initially thought to possess only neutral trehalase activity, reinforced this hypothesis. M. rouxii grows efficiently in trehalose as the sole carbon source. Trehalose-grown or carbon-starved cells exhibit a high trehalase activity of optimum pH 4.5, bound to the external surface of the cell wall, in contrast with the neutral (pH 6.5) trehalase, which occurs in the cytosol. Other differences between the neutral and the acid trehalases are the temperature optimum (35 degrees C and 45 degrees C, respectively) and thermal stability (half-life of 2.5 min and 12 min at 45 degrees C, respectively). The neutral trehalase, but not the acid trehalase, is activated in vitro by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, stimulated by Ca2+, and inhibited by EDTA. It shows maximal activity at germination and decreases as growth proceeds. In contrast the activity of the acid trehalase is totally repressed in glucose-grown cultures and increases upon exhaustion of the carbon source, and is strongly induced by extracellular trehalose.

(1,3)-beta-D-Glucan synthase of Candida albicans was rendered soluble by treatment of membrane preparations with the polyoxyethylene ether detergent W-1. Extraction with 0.025% W-1 at 4 degrees C for 24 h effectively solubilized and activated the enzyme. Under these conditions, greater than 85% of the protein in membrane preparations was released, and about 64% of the glucan synthase activity could be recovered in the soluble form. Soluble enzyme activity was stable for more than 12 days at 4 degrees C. Also, glucan synthase activity in the extracted membrane preparations could be activated to achieve more than twice the enzyme activity in the original, unextracted membrane preparations. The soluble glucan synthase had characteristics similar to those of the membrane-bound enzyme. Soluble glucan synthase had an apparent Km of 2.0 mM, and particulate glucan synthase had an apparent Km of 2.5 mM. Kinetics of cilofungin inhibition for both enzyme preparations were noncompetitive, with an apparent Ki of 2.5 microM; both preparations could be inhibited by cilofungin but not by its peptide nucleus or side chain, either alone or in combination. The reaction products from both forms of the enzyme were sensitive to (1,3)-beta-D-glucanase degradation but not to alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, or proteinase K degradation and thus were shown to be beta(1----3) glucan.

S. cerevisiae, which is sta0 (absence of functional STA genes in haploids), does carry a glucoamylase gene, delta sta, expressed only during sporulation (W. J. Colonna and P. T. Magee, J. Bacteriol. 134:844-853, 1978; I. Yamashita and S. Fukui, Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:3069-3073, 1985). In this study we examined some of the physiological and genetic factors that affect glucoamylase expression. It was found that STA2 strains grown in synthetic medium produce glucoamylase only in the presence of either Maltrin M365 (a mixture of maltooligosaccharides) or starch. Maximal levels of glucoamylase activity were found in cells grown in rich medium supplemented with glycerol plus ethanol, starch, or Maltrin. When various sugars served as carbon sources they all supported glucoamylase synthesis, although at reduced levels. In any given growth medium glucoamylase isozyme II synthesis was modulated by functionality of the mitochondria. Synthesis of glucoamylase is continuous throughout the growth phases, with maximal secretion taking place in the early stationary phase. In the various regimens, the differences in enzyme accumulation are accounted for by differences in the levels of glucoamylase mRNA. Both glucoamylase mRNA and enzyme activity were drastically and coordinately inhibited in MATa/MAT alpha diploids and by the presence of the regulatory gene STA10. Both effects were partially overcome when the STA2 gene was present on a multicopy plasmid. The STA2 mRNA and glucoamylase were coinduced in sporulating STA2/STA2 diploids. A smaller, coinduced RNA species was also detected by Northern blotting with a STA2 probe. The same mRNA species was detected in sporulating sta0 diploids and is likely to encode the sporulation-specific glucoamylase.

D016428 D013485 	Candida konsanensis sp. nov., a new yeast species isolated from Jasminum adenophyllum in Thailand with potentially carboxymethyl cellulase-producing capability.	A new yeast species (KKU-FW10) belonging to the Candida genus was isolated from Jasminum adenophyllum in the Plant Genetic Conservation Project under The Royal Initiative of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn area, Chulabhorn Dam, Konsan district within Chaiyaphum province in Thailand. The strain was identified via analysis of nucleotide sequences from the D1/D2 domain of 26S ribosomal DNA and based on its morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. The sequence obtained from yeast isolate KKU-FW10 was 97 percent identical to that of Candida chanthaburiensis (GenBank accession number AB500861.1), with 506/517 (nucleotides identity/total nucleotides) matching nucleotides, nine substitutions and two gaps being detected. This species belonged to the Candida clade. Regarding morphological characteristics, isolate KKU-FW10 presents cream-colored butyrous colonies, vegetative reproduction through budding and, round cells without filaments or ascospores. The major ubiquinone detected was Q-9. The above results suggest that isolate KKU-FW10 is a new member of the genus Candida, and the name Candida konsanensis is proposed for this yeast. The type strain of the new species is KKU-FW10(T) (= BCC 52588(T), = NBRC 109082(T), = CBS 12666(T)). In addition, this KKU-FW10 could potentially produce 58.24 Units/ml of carboxymethyl cellulase when it was cultured in YP broth containing 1.0 % carboxymethyl cellulose for 24 h. 
11811642	20020129	Mycopathologia	D016428 	Effect of garlic bulb extract on the growth and enzymatic activities of rhizosphere and rhizoplane fungi.	Eighteen fungal species were isolated from rhizospheric soil and rhizoplane samples of three plant crops in southern Iraq. The fungal isolates were examined for the activities of four enzymes (amylase, cellulase, phenoloxidase, and protease), as well as their growth, against crude garlic extract added to the culture agar medium. A high reduction or inhibition of enzymatic activities was observed for the fungi treated with garlic extract compared with untreated fungal cultures. However, most of the species showed inhibition of enzymes due to the effect of garlic extract. The growth of the fungal species was also remarkably reduced by the garlic extract. 
23589840	20130417	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485 	Enzymatic transformation of nonfood biomass to starch.	The global demand for food could double in another 40 y owing to growth in the population and food consumption per capita. To meet the world's future food and sustainability needs for biofuels and renewable materials, the production of starch-rich cereals and cellulose-rich bioenergy plants must grow substantially while minimizing agriculture's environmental footprint and conserving biodiversity. Here we demonstrate one-pot enzymatic conversion of pretreated biomass to starch through a nonnatural synthetic enzymatic pathway composed of endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolyase, cellobiose phosphorylase, and alpha-glucan phosphorylase originating from bacterial, fungal, and plant sources. A special polypeptide cap in potato alpha-glucan phosphorylase was essential to push a partially hydrolyzed intermediate of cellulose forward to the synthesis of amylose. Up to 30% of the anhydroglucose units in cellulose were converted to starch; the remaining cellulose was hydrolyzed to glucose suitable for ethanol production by yeast in the same bioreactor. Next-generation biorefineries based on simultaneous enzymatic biotransformation and microbial fermentation could address the food, biofuels, and environment trilemma. 
21931609	20110921	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 	Disruption of Yarrowia lipolytica TPS1 gene encoding trehalose-6-P synthase does not affect growth in glucose but impairs growth at high temperature.	We have cloned the Yarrowia lipolytica TPS1 gene encoding trehalose-6-P synthase by complementation of the lack of growth in glucose of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae tps1 mutant. Disruption of YlTPS1 could only be achieved with a cassette placed in the 3' half of its coding region due to the overlap of its sequence with the promoter of the essential gene YlTFC1. The Yltps1 mutant grew in glucose although the Y. lipolytica hexokinase is extremely sensitive to inhibition by trehalose-6-P. The presence of a glucokinase, insensitive to trehalose-6-P, that constitutes about 80% of the glucose phosphorylating capacity during growth in glucose may account for the growth phenotype. Trehalose content was below 1 nmol/mg dry weight in Y. lipolytica, but it increased in strains expressing YlTPS1 under the control of the YlTEF1 promoter or with a disruption of YALI0D15598 encoding a putative trehalase. mRNA levels of YlTPS1 were low and did not respond to thermal stresses, but that of YlTPS2 (YALI0D14476) and YlTPS3 (YALI0E31086) increased 4 and 6 times, repectively, by heat treatment. Disruption of YlTPS1 drastically slowed growth at 35°C. Homozygous Yltps1 diploids showed a decreased sporulation frequency that was ascribed to the low level of YALI0D20966 mRNA an homolog of the S. cerevisiae MCK1 which encodes a protein kinase that activates early meiotic gene expression. 
11841200	20020214	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 	Duplicated dockerin subdomains of Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelD bind to a cohesin domain of the scaffolding protein CipA with distinct thermodynamic parameters and a negative cooperativity.	Mutagenized dockerin domains of endoglucanase CelD (type I) and of the cellulosome-integrating protein CipA (type II) were constructed by swapping residues 10 and 11 of the first or the second duplicated segment between the two polypeptides. These residues have been proposed to determine the specificity of cohesin-dockerin interactions. The dockerin domain of CelD still bound to the seventh cohesin domain of CipA (CohCip7), provided that mutagenesis occurred in one segment only. Binding was no longer detected by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis when both segments were mutagenized. The dockerin domain of CipA bound to the cohesin domain of SdbA as long as the second segment was intact. None of the mutated dockerins displayed detectable binding to the noncognate cohesin domain. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that binding of the CelD dockerin to CohCip7 occurred with a high affinity [K(a) = (2.6 +/- 0.5) x 10(9) M(-1)] and a 1:1 stoichiometry. The reaction was weakly exothermic (DeltaHdegrees = -2.22 +/- 0.2 kcal x mol(-1)) and largely entropy driven (TDeltaSdegrees = 10.70 +/- 0.5 kcal x mol(-1)). The heat capacity change on complexation was negative (DeltaC(p) = -305 +/- 15 cal x mol(-1) x K(-1)). These values show that cohesin-dockerin binding is mainly hydrophobic. Mutations in the first or the second dockerin segment reduced or enhanced, respectively, the hydrophobic character of the interaction. Due to partial enthalpy-entropy compensation, these mutations induced only small changes in binding affinity. However, the binding affinity was strongly decreased when both segments were mutated, indicating strong negative cooperativity between the two mutated sites.

D016428 	A thermostable feruloyl-esterase from the hemicellulolytic bacterium Thermobacillus xylanilyticus releases phenolic acids from non-pretreated plant cell walls.	A gene (Tx-est1) encoding a thermostable feruloyl-esterase was isolated from the genome of the gram-positive hemicellulolytic thermophilic bacterium Thermobacillus xylanilyticus. This gene contains an open reading frame of 1,020 bp encoding a protein with molecular mass of 37.4 kDa, similar to feruloyl-esterases from cellulolytic bacteria and fungi. The recombinant enzyme Tx-Est1 was expressed and produced in Escherichia coli. Tx-Est1 contains the conserved putative lipase residues Ser 202, Asp 287, and His 322 which act as catalytic triad in its C-terminus part. Purified Tx-Est1 was active against phenolic acid derivatives and stable at high temperatures. Optimal activity was observed at 65 °C and the optimal pH was around 8.5. The kinetic parameters of the esterase were determined on various substrates. The enzyme displayed activity against methyl esters of hydrocinnamic acids and feruloylated arabino-xylotetraose, exhibiting high specificity and affinity for the latter. Our results showed that Tx-Est1 is a thermostable feruloyl-esterase which could be useful to hydrolyze arabinoxylans from graminaceous plant cell walls as the enzyme is able to release phenolic acids from a lignocellulose biomass. 
1368242	19920501	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Transfer of genes for utilization of starch (sta2) and melibiose (mel) to industrial strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by single-chromosome transfer, using a kar1 mutant as vector.	A method has been developed for the transfer of genes from other yeast strains and species to industrial yeast strains, using a haploid, kar1-1 mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a vector. The sta2 gene, conferring the ability to metabolize starch was transferred from an auxotrophic haploid strain of S. cerevisiae (S. diastaticus) and the melibiose-metabolism (mel) gene(s), from S. kluyveri, to the kar1-1 mutant [K5-5A; (alpha ade2 his4 can1 gal) by normal mating and protoplast fusion. From this strain, the genes were transferred to baker's yeast and brewing yeast strains, which did not utilize starch, and to baker's yeast strains, which did not utilize melibiose, by protoplast fusion, spore-cell pairing, or rare-mating. Strains that utilized starch or melibiose were obtained by all three methods. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis preparations showed little change in the mobility of the chromosomes of the hybrids. The most probable explanation for the results obtained is that single chromosomes were transferred, first, from the donor strains to the kar1-1 haploid mutant strain, and then from the kar1-1 vector to the recipient industrial strain of S. cerevisiae. The transfer of the genes is probably accomplished through formation of disomic strains and then, in the case of the hybrids that metabolize starch, by integration of the sta2 gene into the genome of the industrial yeast strains. 
19552775	20090626	Lett._Appl._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and characterization of actinomycetes from healthy goat faeces.	To isolate and characterize actinomycetes with probiotic activities from healthy goat faeces. Faecal actinomycetes were isolated by dilution methods and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The hydrolytic enzyme activities were analysed by clear zone formation. The antimicrobial activities and resistance to heavy metals were tested by growth inhibition methods. The isolates belong to a small group of actinobacterial genera, including Streptomyces, Nocardiopsis and Oerskovia. The Oerskovia was the most widely distributed genus among the cultures. The proportion of streptomycete-like strains producing amylase or protease is significantly higher than those of other actinomycetes (P < 0.05). Compared with streptomycete-like strains, a higher proportion of (alpha- or beta-) galactase-producing other actinomycetes was found in goat faeces. More than 50% of streptomycete-like strains showed activities against test fungi. Streptomycetes could tolerate 0.25 mmol l(-1) Cr(2)O(7)(2-), 2 mmol l(-1) Ni(2+); however, other actinomycetes are liable to 40 mmol l(-1) Fe(3+) and 0.25 mmol l(-1) Cr(2)O(7)(2-) and resistant to 5 mmol l(-1) Ni(2+) and 2 mmol l(-1) Cu(2+). The different physiological characteristics of the actinomycetes suggested that the cooperation in the actinomycetes might be involved in their association with goat. Probiotic mixtures based on faecal actinomycetes showed potentials in animal production.

The biocontrol potential of Bacillus subtilis isolated from cow dung microflora was investigated in vitro and in vivo against two postharvest yam pathogenic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum and Botryodiplodia theobromae. B. subtilis strains inhibited the growth of F. oxysporum and B. theobromae in vitro in liquid medium in the range of 49.3-56.6% and in solid medium in the range of 31.0-36.0%, in comparison to the corresponding growth of fungi without bacterial inoculation. The interaction between B. subtilis CM1 and F. oxysporum was also studied by scanning electron microscopy. Chitinase production was demonstrated in vitro when B. subtilis was grown in the presence of colloidal chitin as the sole carbon source in a liquid medium. In vivo study showed that B. subtilis strains inhibited the growth of fungi (F. oxysporum and B. thobromae) up to 83% in wound cavities of yam tubers. 
10520161	19991016	Med._Mycol.	D016428 D013485 D013487 	Identification and cloning of GCA1, a gene that encodes a cell surface glucoamylase from Candida albicans.	Adherence of yeast cells of Candida albicans to human oesophageal cells is greater when cells are grown in 500 mM D-galactose in comparison to D-glucose at the same concentration. Moreover, a 190 kDa mannoprotein (MP190) from a yeast cell wall preparation is highly expressed when cells are grown in the presence of galactose but less so in glucose. We now report on the identification of the MP190 and the isolation of its encoding gene. MP190 was purified, and three internal peptides were isolated and sequenced. Each of the three peptides showed significant homology (65-85%) with a glucoamylase (GAM1) from the yeast, Schwanniomyces occidentalis. In order to isolate the C. albicans homologue of GAM1 (GCA1), we probed a genomic library with a 0.9-kb internal fragment of the S. occidentalis GAM1 and isolated a 2.3-kb clone that corresponded to the 5' region of the gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used to isolate the remainder of the open reading frame. GCA1 encodes a 946 amino acid protein containing three putative hydrophobic, membrane-spanning domains and 15 potential N-glycosylation sites. Both Gca1p and GAM1 are novel to the family of glycosyl hydrolases. Northern analysis indicated that GCA1 is transcribed to a greater extent in galactose than in sucrose or glucose. Also, using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, we observed expression of GCA1 in a rat model of oral candidiasis, indicating that Gca1p is expressed during disease development. 
10467122	19990901	Biotechnol._Appl._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and biochemical characteristics of beta-D-xylanase from a thermophilic fungus, Thermomyces lanuginosus-SSBP.	An extracellular xylanase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrate of a thermophilic fungus, Thermomyces lanuginosus-SSBP, and its biochemical characteristics were studied. A yield of 70-80% was achieved through the procedures of 80%-satd. ammonium sulphate precipitation, DEAE-Sephadex A25 and quaternary aminoethyl (QAE)-Sephadex A25 column chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified xylanase was 23.6 kDa, as analysed by SDS/PAGE, with a pI value of 3.8. The molar absorption coefficient of the absorbance at 280 nm was 6.8x10(4) M(-1).cm(-1). The specific activity, calculated using the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method, was 3500 units/mg. The enzyme reactions followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with K app m and V(max) values of 3.26 mg/ml and 6300 units/ml per mg of protein respectively, as obtained from a Lineweaver-Burk plot. The xylanase contained no other enzyme activity (cellulase, beta-glucosidase, beta-mannosidase, alpha-arabinofuranosidase, or beta-xylosidase) except for the hydrolysis of xylan substrate. The optimal temperature of the enzyme assay was 70-75 degrees C. The enzyme retained full activity after a 60 degrees C incubation for 3 h. The optimal pH of xylanase activity was 6.5 and the enzyme appeared to be stable over a broad pH range (pH 5-12) under the assay conditions. The majority of the metal ions tested had no effect on the enzyme activity, with the exception of Pb(2+) (modest inhibitor) and Hg(2+) (strong inhibitor). The results showed that one or two tryptophan residues oxidized by N-bromosuccinamide per enzyme molecule was sufficient to inhibit the enzyme activity completely, thus indicating that the tryptophan residues play an important role in the catalytical processes of the enzyme reaction. Because of the outstanding properties of the purified xylanase from the SSBP strain, this xylanase has a potential use in biopulping processes and other industrial applications. 
18078955	20071215	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Understanding the structural basis for substrate and inhibitor recognition in eukaryotic GH11 xylanases.	Endo-beta1,4-xylanases (xylanases) hydrolyse the beta1,4 glycosidic bonds in the backbone of xylan. Although xylanases from glycoside hydrolase family 11 (GH11) have been extensively studied, several issues remain unresolved. Thus, the mechanism by which these enzymes hydrolyse decorated xylans is unclear and the structural basis for the variation in catalytic activity within this family is unknown. Furthermore, the mechanism for the differences in the inhibition of fungal GH11 enzymes by the wheat protein XIP-I remains opaque. To address these issues we report the crystal structure and biochemical properties of the Neocallimastix patriciarum xylanase NpXyn11A, which displays unusually high catalytic activity and is one of the few fungal GH11 proteins not inhibited by XIP-I. Although the structure of NpXyn11A could not be determined in complex with substrates, we have been able to investigate how GH11 enzymes hydrolyse decorated substrates by solving the crystal structure of a second GH11 xylanase, EnXyn11A (encoded by an environmental DNA sample), bound to ferulic acid-1,5-arabinofuranose-alpha1,3-xylotriose (FAX(3)). The crystal structure of the EnXyn11A-FAX(3) complex shows that solvent exposure of the backbone xylose O2 and O3 groups at subsites -3 and +2 allow accommodation of alpha1,2-linked 4-methyl-D-glucuronic acid and L-arabinofuranose side chains. Furthermore, the ferulated arabinofuranose side chain makes hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions at the +2 subsite, indicating that the decoration may represent a specificity determinant at this aglycone subsite. The structure of NpXyn11A reveals potential -3 and +3 subsites that are kinetically significant. The extended substrate-binding cleft of NpXyn11A, compared to other GH11 xylanases, may explain why the Neocallimastix enzyme displays unusually high catalytic activity. Finally, the crystal structure of NpXyn11A shows that the resistance of the enzyme to XIP-I is not due solely to insertions in the loop connecting beta strands 11 and 12, as suggested previously, but is highly complex. 
21816879	20110806	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485 	PcchiB1, encoding a class V chitinase, is affected by PcVelA and PcLaeA, and is responsible for cell wall integrity in Penicillium chrysogenum.	Penicillin production in Penicillium chrysogenum is controlled by PcVelA and PcLaeA, two components of the regulatory velvet-like complex. Comparative microarray analysis with mutants lacking PcVelA or PcLaeA revealed a set of 62 common genes affected by the loss of both components. A downregulated gene in both knockout strains is PcchiB1, potentially encoding a class V chitinase. Under nutrient-depleted conditions, transcript levels of PcchiB1 are strongly upregulated, and the gene product contributes to more than 50 % of extracellular chitinase activity. Functional characterization by generating PcchiB1-disruption strains revealed that PcChiB1 is responsible for cell wall integrity and pellet formation in P. chrysogenum. Further, fluorescence microscopy with a DsRed-labelled chitinase suggests a cell wall association of the protein. An unexpected phenotype occurred when knockout strains were grown on media containing N-acetylglucosamine as the sole C and N source, where, in contrast to the recipient, a penicillin producer strain, the mutants and an ancestral strain show distinct mycelial growth. We discuss the relevance of this class V chitinase for morphology in an industrially important fungus.

Three wild-type white rot fungi and two cellulase-less mutants developed from Phanerochaete chrysosporium K-3 (formerly Sporotrichum pulverulentum) were tested for their ability to delignify grass cell walls and improve biodegradation by rumen microorganisms. Fungal-treated and control stems of Bermuda grass were analyzed for their content of ester- and ether-linked aromatics by using alkali extraction and gas chromatography, for in vitro dry weight digestion and production of volatile fatty acids in in vitro fermentations with mixed ruminal microorganisms, for loss of lignin and other aromatics from specific cell wall types by using microspectrophotometry, and for structural changes before and after in vitro degradation by rumen microorganisms by using transmission electron microscopy. P. chrysosporium K-3 and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora FP 90031-sp produced the greatest losses in lignin and improved the biodegradation of Bermuda grass over that of untreated control substrate. However, C. subvermispora removed the most lignin and significantly improved biodegradation over all other treatments. Phellinus pini RAB-83-19 and cellulase-less mutants 3113 and 85118 developed from P. chrysosporium K-3 did not improve the biodegradation of Bermuda grass lignocellulose. Results indicated that C. subvermispora extensively removed ester-linked p-coumaric and ferulic acids and also removed the greatest amount of non-ester-linked aromatics from plant cell walls. Microscopic observations further indicated that C. subvermispora removed esters from parenchyma cell walls as well as esters and lignin from the more recalcitrant cell walls (i.e., sclerenchyma and vascular tissues). C. subvermispora improved in vitro digestion and volatile fatty acid production by ruminal microorganisms by about 80%, while dry matter loss due to fungi was about 20% greater than loss in untreated control stems. The chemical and structural studies used identified sites of specific fungal attack and suggested mechanisms whereby improvement occurred.

In the course of selection of Trichoderma viride, the producer of cellulolytic enzymes, the group of mutant strains characterized by a higher level of productivity are isolate. It is shown that the isolated mutants possess a number of common but differing them from original strains characters. These include: the small size of colonies ("dwarfs"), a lower capacity to carry out some biochemical reactions, and increased development rate and a higher resistance to lethal effect of nitrosoguanidine and nitrosoethyl urea. The data obtained indicate that in the series of populations of successively isolated mutants observed the stabilization of variability of the levels of C1 enzyme synthesis takes place. It is also shown that, unlike original cultures, the populations of mutant strains are characterized by a higher variability of Cx enzyme activity levels as compared with C1.

Cellulosic biofuels represent a powerful alternative to petroleum but are currently limited by the inefficiencies of the conversion process. While gram-positive and fungal organisms have been widely explored as sources of cellulases and hemicellulases for biomass degradation, gram-negative organisms have received less experimental attention. We investigated the ability of Cellvibrio japonicus, a recently sequenced gram-negative cellulolytic bacterium, to degrade bioenergy-related feedstocks. Using a newly developed biomass medium, we showed that C. japonicus is able to utilize corn stover and switchgrass as sole sources of carbon and energy for growth. We also developed tools for directed gene disruptions in C. japonicus and used this system to construct a mutant in the gspD gene, which is predicted to encode a component of the type II secretion system. The gspD::pJGG1 mutant displayed a greater-than-2-fold decrease in endoglucanase secretion compared to wild-type C. japonicus. In addition, the mutant strain showed a pronounced growth defect in medium with biomass as a carbon source, yielding 100-fold fewer viable cells than the wild type. To test the potential of C. japonicus to undergo metabolic engineering, we constructed a strain able to produce small amounts of ethanol from biomass. Collectively, these data suggest that C. japonicus is a useful platform for biomass conversion and biofuel production.

An intra-cellular beta-glucosidase was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography and HPGPLC from mycelial extract of Termitomyces clypeatus in the presence of the glycosylation inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose. CD spectroscopy demonstrated that the purified enzyme exhibited alpha-helical conformation. MALDI-TOF identified the enzyme's molecular weight as 6688Daltons, but SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting indicated that the enzyme formed aggregates. The enzyme also showed unique properties of co-aggregation with sucrase in the fungus. The enzyme showed around 80% stability up to 60 degrees C and residual activity was 80-100% between pH ranges 5-8. The enzyme had higher specific activity against p-nitrophenyl-d-glucopyranoside than cellobiose and HPLC showed that the enzyme possesses transglycosylation activity and synthesizes cello-oligosaccharides by addition of glucose. The enzyme will be useful in synthetic biology to produce complex bioactive glycosides and to avoid chemical hazards. This is the first report of a beta-glucosidase enzyme with such a low monomeric unit size.

Feruloyl esterases have potential uses over a broad range of applications in the agri-food industries. In recent years, the number of microbial feruloyl esterase activities reported has increased and, in parallel, even more related protein sequences may be discerned in the growing genome databases. Based on substrate utilisation data and supported by primary sequence identity, four sub-classes have been characterised and termed type-A, B, C and D. The proposed sub-classification scheme is discussed in terms of the evolutionary relationships existing between carbohydrate esterases.

D003160 D016428 D013485 	Enhancement of soluble dietary fibre, polyphenols and antioxidant properties of chapatis prepared from whole wheat flour dough treated with amylases and xylanase.	Chapati preparation involves various processing steps such as mixing the flour into dough, sheeting and baking. During these processing steps, flour components are likely to undergo changes in their nutrient and polyphenol composition and their antioxidant properties due to phenol-mediated crosslinking of proteins and carbohydrates. Therefore, in the present study, changes in nutritional, nutraceutical and antioxidant properties of chapatis prepared from doughs treated with amylases and xylanase were determined. An increase in insoluble dietary fibre content and a decrease in soluble polyphenol content were observed during preparation of control chapatis from whole wheat flours. However, significant increases in soluble dietary fibre and soluble polyphenol contents were observed in chapatis prepared from amylase-treated doughs compared with control chapatis. Extracts of chapatis prepared from amylase- and xylanase-treated doughs showed better antioxidant properties than extracts of control chapatis. Among these enzyme treatments, chapatis prepared from amylase-treated doughs showed better antioxidant properties than chapatis prepared from xylanase-treated doughs. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of extracts of chapatis prepared from doughs treated with amylases showed the presence of potential antioxidant phenolic acids such as caffeic, gentisic and syringic acids in addition to the phenolic acids present in control chapatis. Treatment of doughs with amylases increased the contents of soluble dietary fibre and soluble polyphenols as well as improving the antioxidant properties of chapatis.

Trichoderma reesei is an industrial producer of enzymes that degrade lignocellulosic polysaccharides to soluble monomers, which can be fermented to biofuels. Here we show that the expression of genes for lignocellulose degradation are controlled by the orthologous T. reesei protein methyltransferase LAE1. In a lae1 deletion mutant we observed a complete loss of expression of all seven cellulases, auxiliary factors for cellulose degradation, β-glucosidases and xylanases were no longer expressed. Conversely, enhanced expression of lae1 resulted in significantly increased cellulase gene transcription. Lae1-modulated cellulase gene expression was dependent on the function of the general cellulase regulator XYR1, but also xyr1 expression was LAE1-dependent. LAE1 was also essential for conidiation of T. reesei. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing ('ChIP-seq') showed that lae1 expression was not obviously correlated with H3K4 di- or trimethylation (indicative of active transcription) or H3K9 trimethylation (typical for heterochromatin regions) in CAZyme coding regions, suggesting that LAE1 does not affect CAZyme gene expression by directly modulating H3K4 or H3K9 methylation. Our data demonstrate that the putative protein methyltransferase LAE1 is essential for cellulase gene expression in T. reesei through mechanisms that remain to be identified.

The signal peptide of Aspergillus oryzae endo-(1,4)-beta-xylanase XynF1 contains a C-terminal serine-arginine that directs efficient secretion of the enzyme into the culture medium. In the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus, however, there is little secretion of XynF1 into the culture medium. Modification of the C-terminal sequence of the signal peptide to lysine-arginine resulted in efficient secretion of C. cinereus XynF1, suggesting the presence of a KEX2-like protease in this fungus. 
2513481	19891101	Mol._Cell._Biol.	D016428 D013487 	Mutations in the signal sequence of prepro-alpha-factor inhibit both translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum and processing by signal peptidase in yeast cells.	The effects of five single-amino-acid substitution mutations within the signal sequence of yeast prepro-alpha-factor were tested in yeast cells. After short pulse-labelings, virtually all of the alpha-factor precursor proteins from a wild-type gene were glycosylated and processed by signal peptidase. In contrast, the signal sequence mutations resulted in the accumulation of mostly unglycosylated prepro-alpha-factor after a short labeling interval, indicating a defect in translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum. Confirming this interpretation, unglycosylated mutant prepro-alpha-factor in cell extracts was sensitive to proteinase K and therefore in a cytosolic location. The signal sequence mutations reduced the rate of translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum by as much as 25-fold or more. In at least one case, mutant prepro-alpha-factor molecules were translocated almost entirely posttranslationally. Four of the five mutations also reduced the rate of proteolytic processing by signal peptidase in vivo, even though the signal peptide alterations are not located near the cleavage site. This study demonstrates that a single-amino-acid substitution mutation within a eucaryotic signal peptide can affect both translocation and proteolytic processing in vivo and may indicate that the recognition sequences for translocation and processing overlap within the signal peptide. 
19099608	20081223	BMC_Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Plant growth promotion and Penicillium citrinum.	Endophytic fungi are known plant symbionts. They produce a variety of beneficial metabolites for plant growth and survival, as well as defend their hosts from attack of certain pathogens. Coastal dunes are nutrient deficient and offer harsh, saline environment for the existing flora and fauna. Endophytic fungi may play an important role in plant survival by enhancing nutrient uptake and producing growth-promoting metabolites such as gibberellins and auxins. We screened roots of Ixeris repenes (L.) A. Gray, a common dune plant, for the isolation of gibberellin secreting endophytic fungi. We isolated 15 endophytic fungi from the roots of Ixeris repenes and screened them for growth promoting secondary metabolites. The fungal isolate IR-3-3 gave maximum plant growth when applied to waito-c rice and Atriplex gemelinii seedlings. Analysis of the culture filtrate of IR-3-3 showed the presence of physiologically active gibberellins, GA1, GA3, GA4 and GA7 (1.95 ng/ml, 3.83 ng/ml, 6.03 ng/ml and 2.35 ng/ml, respectively) along with other physiologically inactive GA5, GA9, GA12, GA15, GA19, GA20 and, GA24. The plant growth promotion and gibberellin producing capacity of IR-3-3 was much higher than the wild type Gibberella fujikuroi, which was taken as control during present study. GA5, a precursor of bioactive GA3 was reported for the first time in fungi. The fungal isolate IR-3-3 was identified as a new strain of Penicillium citrinum (named as P. citrinum KACC43900) through phylogenetic analysis of 18S rDNA sequence. Isolation of new strain of Penicillium citrinum from the sand dune flora is interesting as information on the presence of Pencillium species in coastal sand dunes is limited. The plant growth promoting ability of this fungal strain may help in conservation and revegetation of the rapidly eroding sand dune flora. Penicillium citrinum is already known for producing mycotoxin citrinin and cellulose digesting enzymes like cellulase and endoglucanase, as well as xylulase. Gibberellins producing ability of this fungus and the discovery about the presence of GA5 will open new aspects of research and investigations. 
18944733	20081024	Phytopathology	D016428 	A Corn Trypsin Inhibitor with Antifungal Activity Inhibits Aspergillus flavus alpha-Amylase.	ABSTRACT In this study, we found that the inhibition of fungal growth in potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium by the 14-kDa corn trypsin inhibitor (TI) protein, previously found to be associated with host resistance to aflatoxin production and active against various fungi, was relieved when exogenous alpha-amylase was added along with TI. No inhibitory effect of TI on fungal growth was observed when Aspergillus flavus was grown on a medium containing either 5% glucose or 1% gelatin as a carbon source. Further investigation found that TI not only inhibited fungal production of extracellular alpha-amylase when A. flavus was grown in PDB medium containing TI at 100 mug ml(-1) but also reduced the enzymatic activity of A. flavus alpha-amylase by 27%. At a higher concentration, however, TI stimulated the production of alpha-amylase. The effect of TI on the production of amyloglucosidase, another enzyme involved in starch metabolism by the fungus, was quite different. It stimulated the production of this enzyme during the first 10 h at all concentrations studied. These studies suggest that the resistance of certain corn genotypes to A. flavus infection may be partially due to the ability of TI to reduce the production of extracellular fungal alpha-amylase and its activity, thereby limiting the availability of simple sugars for fungal growth. However, further investigation of the relationship between TI levels and fungal alpha-amylase expression in vivo is needed. 
11217409	20010224	Adv._Biochem._Eng._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013486 D016454 	Polyesters in higher plants.	Polyesters occur in higher plants as the structural component of the cuticle that covers the aerial parts of plants. This insoluble polymer, called cutin, attached to the epidermal cell walls is composed of interesterified hydroxy and hydroxy epoxy fatty acids. The most common chief monomers are 10,16-dihydroxy C16 acid, 18-hydroxy-9,10 epoxy C18 acid, and 9,10,18-trihydroxy C18 acid. These monomers are produced in the epidermal cells by omega hydroxylation, in-chain hydroxylation, epoxidation catalyzed by P450-type mixed function oxidase, and epoxide hydration. The monomer acyl groups are transferred to hydroxyl groups in the growing polymer at the extracellular location. The other type of polyester found in the plants is suberin, a polymeric material deposited in the cell walls of a layer or two of cells when a plant needs to erect a barrier as a result of physical or biological stress from the environment, or during development. Suberin is composed of aromatic domains derived from cinnamic acid, and aliphatic polyester domains derived from C16 and C18 cellular fatty acids and their elongation products. The polyesters can be hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase and cutinase, a polyesterase produced by bacteria and fungi. Catalysis by cutinase involves the active serine catalytic triad. The major function of the polyester in plants is as a protective barrier against physical, chemical, and biological factors in the environment, including pathogens. Transcriptional regulation of cutinase gene in fungal pathogens is being elucidated at a molecular level. The polyesters present in agricultural waste may be used to produce high value polymers, and genetic engineering might be used to produce large quantities of such polymers in plants. 
23769310	20130618	Enzyme_Microb._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	RNA interference with carbon catabolite repression in Trichoderma koningii for enhancing cellulase production.	The cellulase and xylanase genes of filamentous Trichoderma fungi exist under carbon catabolite repression mediated by the regulator carbon catabolite repressor (CREI). Our objective was to find the role of CREI in a cellulase-hyperproducing mutant of Trichoderma koningii, and address whether enzyme production can be further improved by silencing the cre1 gene. cre1 partially silenced strains were constructed to improve enzyme production in T. koningii YC01, a cellulase-hyperproducing mutant. Silencing of cre1 resulted in derepression of cellulase gene expression in glucose-based cultivation. The cre1 interference strain C313 produced 2.1-, 1.4-, 0.8-, and 0.8-fold higher amounts of filter paper activity, β-1,4-exoglucanase activity (ρ-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside as substrate), β-1,4-endoglucanase activity (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as substrate), and xylanase activity, respectively, than the control strain, suggesting that silencing of cre1 resulted in enhanced enzyme production capability. In addition, downregulation of cre1 resulted in elevated expression of another regulator of xylanase and cellulase expression, xyr1, indicating that CREI also acted as a repressor of xyr1 transcription in T. koningii under inducing conditions. These results show that RNAi is a feasible method for analyzing the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression and improving xylanase and cellulase productivity in T. koningii. 
10672446	20000215	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Molecular characterization of a PDI-related gene prpA in Aspergillus niger var. awamori.	A gene (prpA) homologous to the protein disulfide isomerase gene was isolated from Aspergillus niger by Southern hybridization using the pdi1 gene isolated from Trichoderma reesei as a DNA probe. The corresponding cDNA of the prpA gene has also been isolated from an A. niger var. awamori cDNA library. The prpA gene does not belong to any currently recognized family of protein disulfide isomerases since it contains only a single conserved thioredoxin domain at the N-terminus of the protein. The C-terminal two-thirds of the protein has no homology to any known proteins in the database. The PRPA protein contains an ER retention signal (HDEL) at its C-terminal end suggesting that it is located in the ER. Southern hybridization at high stringency showed that it was present as a single copy in the genome. Northern hybridization indicated that the transcript level of the prpA gene was higher if the cells were secreting a heterologous protein, bovine prochymosin. However, over-expression of the prpA gene from a multicopy integrated vector had little effect on chymosin secretion. A strain containing a deletion of the prpA gene was viable. However, deletion of the prpA gene appeared to cause a reduction of bovine chymosin production.

Laccase-negative filamentous fungus INBI 2-26(-) isolated from non-sporulating laccase-forming fungal association INBI 2-26 by means of protoplast technique was identified as Chaetomium sp. based on partial sequence of its rRNA genes. In the presence of natural cellulose sources, the strain secreted neutral cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) activity both in pure culture and in co-culture with laccase-positive filamentous fungus INBI 2-26(+) isolated from the same association. INBI 2-26(-) also secreted CDH during submerged cultivation in minimal medium with glucose as the sole carbon source. Maximal CDH activity of 1IU/ml at pH 6 with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) as an acceptor was obtained on 12th day of submerged cultivation with filter paper as major cellulose source. Cellulase system of Chaetomium sp. INBI 2-26(-) capable of adsorption onto H(3)PO(4)-swollen filter paper consisted of four major proteins (Mr 200, 95, 65 and 55K) based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was capable of DCPIP reduction without exogenous cellobiose. 
18454328	19970201	Folia_Microbiol._(Praha)	D016428 	Enhanced production of cellulases byCellulomonas strains grown on different cellulosic residues.	Cellulomonas strains consumed commercial cellulose, cellulosic residues, xylan, cellobiose and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as carbon sources in liquid culture, the growth being the most on cellobiose medium. All three components of the cellulase complex ofCellulomonas were produced when the organisms utilized all substrates as sole carbon and energy sources. The filter-paper cellulase (FPase) and endo-glucanase (CMCase) activities were higher in media containing alpha-cellulose and cellulosic residues than in media containing CMC, cellobiose, and xylan. Cell-free supernatants of all organisms exhibited greater CMC hydrolyzing activity than filter paper and beta-glucoside hydrolyzing activities. All strains synthesized beta-glucosidase maximally on cellobiose followed by commercial cellulose and cellulosic residues.C. biazotea produced the highest FPase and CMCase activity during growth on alpha-cellulose. It was followed byC. flavigena, C. cellasea, andC. fimi. Endo-glucanase and FPase from all organisms were secreted into the medium; 10-13 % became adsorbed on the surface of the insoluble substrates and could be successfully eluted using Tween 80. beta-Glucosidase was located in cell extracts from all organisms.C. biazotea produced FPase and beta-glucosidase activities several-fold greater than those produced by many other strains ofCellulomonas and some other cellulolytic bacteria and fungi.

D003160 D016428 D013485 	Regulation (alteration) of activity and conformation of sucrase by coaggregation with cellobiase in culture medium of Termitomyces clypeatus.	Extracellular sucrase (S) of Termitomyces clypeatus was aggregated with cellobiase (C) in culture filtrate and coaggregates of sucrase to cellobiase with different activity ratios (S/C) were obtained during purification. Specific activity of the enzyme decreased significantly, after purification of sucrase free from cellobiase. Purified sucrase was characterized as a glycoprotein of molar mass around 55kDa as indicated by SDS-PAGE and HPGPLC. K(m) and V(max) of the purified enzyme were determined as 34.48 mM and 13.3 U/mg, respectively, at optimum temperature (45 degrees C) and pH (5.0). Substrate affinity and reaction velocity of the purified enzyme, free from cellobiase, was lowered by approximately 3.5 and 55 times, respectively, than that of the enzyme obtained from culture filtrate. The instant regain of sucrase activity up to the extent of 41% was obtained on in vitro addition of cellobiase (free from sucrase) to the enzyme in incubation mixture. Conformation of the enzyme free from cellobiase appeared to be significantly different from that of the coaggregate, as analyzed by circular dichroic and light scattering spectroscopy. It was concluded that activity and conformation of sucrase is regulated (altered) by heteroaggregation with cellobiase in the fungus. 
6355759	19830101	Mol._Gen._Genet.	D016428 D013487 	Identification and physical characterization of yeast maltase structural genes.	Each of at least five unlinked MAL loci (MAL1 through MAL4 and MAL6) on the yeast genome controls the ability to synthesize an inducible alpha-D-glucosidase (maltase). A subcloned fragment of the coding sequence of the MAL6 maltase structural gene was used as a hybridization probe to investigate the physical structure of the family of MAL structural genes in the genomes of different Saccharomyces strains. MAL+ strains, each carrying a genetically defined MAL locus, were crossed with a MAL- strain and the segregation behavior of the functional locus and of sequences complementary to the maltase structural gene at that locus analyzed. The maltase structural gene sequences of each MaL locus were detected by Southern blot hybridization using BamH1 digests of genomic DNA of the meiotic products. This restriction enzyme was previously shown to cleave outside the confines of the MAL 6 locus. The results of such experiments indicate that each MAL locus encompasses at least one maltase structural gene sequence homologous to that of MAL6, that yeast strains that lack functional MAL loci may or may not contain the corresponding maltase structural gene sequence, that the MAL1 maltase structural gene sequence or one of its alleles can be detected in all laboratory yeast strains examined and that each MAL locus can be identified as a characteristic BamH1 fragment of genomic DNA which includes a maltase structural gene. Yeast strains vary in the number of maltase structural gene sequences that they carry. By using the approach described in this report, the ones corresponding to the different functional MAL loci and residing within a BamH1 generated restriction fragment can be identified. 
11988501	20020504	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485 	Production of a monoclonal antibody specific to the genus Trichoderma and closely related fungi, and its use to detect Trichoderma spp. in naturally infested composts.	Studies of the interactions between hyperparasitic fungi and their hosts are severely hampered by the absence of methods that allow the unambiguous identification of individual genera in complex environments that contain mixed populations of fungi, such as soil or compost. This study details the development of a monoclonal antibody (MF2) that allows the detection and recovery of Trichoderma spp. in naturally infested composts, and the visualization of hyperparasitic strains of Trichoderma during antagonistic interactions with their hosts. Murine monoclonal antibody MF2, of immunoglobulin class M (IgM), was raised against a protein epitope of a glycoprotein antigen(s) specific for species of the genus Trichoderma and for the closely related fungi Gliocladium viride, Hypomyces chrysospermus, Sphaerostilbella spp. and Hypocrea spp. MF2 did not react with antigens from Gliocladium catenulatum, Gliocladium roseum, Nectria ochroleuca and Clonostachys spp., nor with a range of unrelated soil- and compost-borne fungi. Extracellular production of the MF2 antigen was constitutive. Western-blotting analysis showed that MF2 bound to a ladder of proteins with apparent molecular masses in the range 35-200 kDa. Immunofluorescence studies showed that MF2 bound strongly to the cell walls of hyphae and phialides and the intercalary and terminal chlamydospores of Trichoderma spp., whereas immunogold electron microscopy revealed strong binding of MF2 to the cell walls and septa of hyphae and to the cell walls of phialoconidia. In immunofluorescence studies of dual cultures of Trichoderma and Rhizoctonia solani, only the cell walls of the hyperparasite, which coiled around the host, were stained by MF2. The specificity of MF2 enabled the development of a combined baiting-ELISA technique for the detection of Trichoderma spp. in naturally infested composts. The specificity of this technique was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rRNA-encoding regions of the isolates. 
22922773	20120828	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 	Production of antifungal chitinase by Aspergillus niger LOCK 62 and its potential role in the biological control.	Aspergillus niger LOCK 62 produces an antifungal chitinase. Different sources of chitin in the medium were used to test the production of the chitinase. Chitinase production was most effective when colloidal chitin and shrimp shell were used as substrates. The optimum incubation period for chitinase production by Aspergillus niger LOCK 62 was 6 days. The chitinase was purified from the culture medium by fractionation with ammonium sulfate and affinity chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 43 kDa. The highest activity was obtained at 40 °C for both crude and purified enzymes. The crude chitinase activity was stable during 180 min incubation at 40 °C, but purified chitinase lost about 25 % of its activity under these conditions. Optimal pH for chitinase activity was pH 6-6.5. The activity of crude and purified enzyme was stabilized by Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) ions, but inhibited by Hg(2+) and Pb(2+) ions. Chitinase isolated from Aspergillus niger LOCK 62 inhibited the growth of the fungal phytopathogens: Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium solani and Rhizoctonia solani. The growth of Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria alternata, and Fusarium oxysporum was not affected. 
22075023	20111115	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485 	The seven-transmembrane receptor Gpr1 governs processes relevant for the antagonistic interaction of Trichoderma atroviride with its host.	Mycoparasitic Trichoderma species are applied as biocontrol agents in agriculture to guard plants against fungal diseases. During mycoparasitism, Trichoderma directly interacts with phytopathogenic fungi, preceded by a specific recognition of the host and resulting in its disarming and killing. In various fungal pathogens, including mycoparasites, signalling via heterotrimeric G proteins plays a major role in regulating pathogenicity-related functions. However, the corresponding receptors involved in the recognition of host-derived signals are largely unknown. Functional characterization of Trichoderma atroviride Gpr1 revealed a prominent role of this seven-transmembrane protein of the cAMP-receptor-like family of fungal G-protein-coupled receptors in the antagonistic interaction with the host fungus and governing of mycoparasitism-related processes. Silencing of gpr1 led to an avirulent phenotype accompanied by an inability to attach to host hyphae. Furthermore, gpr1-silenced transformants were unable to respond to the presence of living host fungi with the expression of chitinase- and protease-encoding genes. Addition of exogenous cAMP was able to restore host attachment in gpr1-silenced transformants but could not restore mycoparasitic overgrowth. A search for downstream targets of the signalling pathway(s) involving Gpr1 resulted in the isolation of genes encoding e.g. a member of the cyclin-like superfamily and a small secreted cysteine-rich protein. Although silencing of gpr1 caused defects similar to those of mutants lacking the Tga3 Gα protein, no direct interaction between Gpr1 and Tga3 was observed in a split-ubiquitin two-hybrid assay.

The aim of this work was to have cellulase activity and hemicellulase activity screenings of endophyte Acremonium species (Acremonium zeae EA0802 and Acremonium sp. EA0810). Both fungi were cultivated in submerged culture (SC) containing L -arabinose, D -xylose, oat spelt xylan, sugarcane bagasse, or corn straw as carbon source. In solid-state fermentation, it was tested as carbon source sugarcane bagasse or corn straw. The highest FPase, endoglucanase, and xylanase activities were produced by Acremonium sp. EA0810 cultivated in SC containing sugarcane bagasse as a carbon source. The highest β-glucosidase activity was produced by Acremonium sp. EA0810 cultivated in SC using D -xylose as carbon source. A. zeae EA0802 has highest α-arabinofuranosidase and α-galactosidase activities in SC using xylan as a carbon source. FPase, endoglucanase, β-glucosidase, and xylanase from Acremonium sp.

Biochemical variability of culture filtrates from the common allergenic mold Alternaria alternata was studied. Differences between culture filtrates from 7 different isolates and between 4 batches of culture filtrate from the same isolate were observed, suggesting the unreliability of presently employed biochemical methods in the routine standardization of mold allergens and the possibility of difficulties in developing standard techniques for their purification. Dextranases, cellulases, and agarases, found in one culture filtrate, may be a further source of problems in laboratory techniques employing A. alternata. The proportions of nitrogen:carbohydrate:dialyzed dry weight were different in culture filtrates from each isolate. Polysaccharides in culture filtrates from 3 of the 7 isolated contained glucose, mannose, xylose, galactose, and a fifth, unidentified sugar. Polysaccharides from one isolate lacked xylose, and the fifth sugar was not demonstrable in 4 of the isolates. Despite the biochemical differences, extensive antigenic cross-reactivity between different isolates was found in precipitin studies and inhibition of antibody binding.

This review makes a comprehensive survey of microbial amylases, i.e. alpha-amylase, beta-amylase and glucoamylase. Amylases are among the most important enzymes and are of great significance in present-day biotechnology. Although they can be derived from several sources, such as plants, animals and micro-organisms, the enzymes from microbial sources generally meet industrial demands. Microbial amylases could be potentially useful in the pharmaceutical and fine-chemical industries if enzymes with suitable properties could be prepared. With the advent of new frontiers in biotechnology, the spectrum of amylase application has widened in many other fields, such as clinical, medicinal and analytical chemistries, as well as their widespread application in starch saccharification and in the textile, food, brewing and distilling industries. In this review, after a brief description of the sources of amylases, we discuss the molecular biology of amylases, describing structures, cloning, sequences, and protoplast fusion and mutagenesis. This is followed by sections on their production and finally the properties of various amylases.

To infer the molecular evolution of yeast Saccharomyces sensu stricto from analysis of the alpha-galactosidase MEL gene family, two new genes were cloned and sequenced from S. bayanus var. bayanus and S. pastorianus. Nucleotide sequence homology of the MEL genes of S. bayanus var. bayanus (MELb), S. pastorianus (MELpt), S. bayanus var. uvarum (MELu), and S. carlsbergensis (MELx) was rather high (94.1-99.3%), comparable with interspecific homology (94.8-100%) of S. cerevisiae MEL1-MEL11. Homology of the MEL genes of sibling species S. cerevisiae (MEL1), S. bayanus (MELb), S. paradoxus (MELp), and S. mikatae (MELj) was 76.2-81.7%, suggesting certain species specificity. On this evidence, the alpha-galactosidase gene of hybrid yeast S. pastorianus (S. carlsbergensis) was assumed to originate from S. bayanus rather than from S. cerevisiae.

An investigation of the physical, chemical and microbial population changes that occurred during the composting of water hyacinth was carried out. After 11 weeks of composting, the compost turned black, had decomposed and had no smell. The pH was 7 and the highest temperature reached, of 40 degrees C occurred in the first week. The initial carbon/nitrogen ratio was 17.61 and this increased to 18.12 by the end of the composting. The coliform population declined greatly from 8.11 to 5.85 MPN (log)/g and fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli were not detected in the final product. Bacteria were the dominant microbes in the compost followed by actinomycetes and fungi. Mesophillic microorganisms were present in higher numbers than thermophillic microorganisms throughout the composting. The highest cellulase and xylanase activities in the compost of 6.67 and 10.24 U/kg DW, respectively were detected in the second week which was related to the temperature. Bacillus sp. strain B4 was isolated and investigated for cellulase and xylanase using agro-industrial residues as substrates during Solid-State Fermentation (SSF) processes. Corncob and rice straw were good substrates for the production of the enzymes with a maximum cellulase of 1.19 U/gDW and xylanase activity of 2.54 U/g DW, respectively. The activities of both enzymes were stable and maximum at 50 degrees C. This study indicated that agro-industrial residues should be mixed with water hyacinth for composting to facilitate the development of a thermophilic phase during the composting process and to improve the product. Bacillus sp. strain B4 can be used as a starter strain. 
17726719	20070830	J._Pept._Sci.	D016428 	Lipid transfer proteins from Brassica campestris and mung bean surpass mung bean chitinase in exploitability.	Antifungal peptides with a molecular mass of 9 kDa and an N-terminal sequence demonstrating remarkable similarity to those of nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) were isolated from seeds of the vegetable Brassica campestris and the mung bean. The purified peptides exerted an inhibitory action on mycelial growth in various fungal species. The antifungal activity of Brassica and mung bean nsLTPs were thermostable, pH-stable, and stable after treatment with pepsin and trypsin. In contrast, the antifungal activity of mung bean chitinase was much less stable to changes in pH and temperature. Brassica LTP inhibited proliferation of hepatoma Hep G2 cells and breast cancer MCF 7 cells with an IC(50) of 5.8 and 1.6 microM, respectively, and the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC(50) of 4 microM. However, mung bean LTP and chitinase were devoid of antiproliferative and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities. In contrast to the mung bean LTP, which exhibited antibacterial activity, Brassica LTP was inactive. All three antifungal peptides lacked mitogenic activity toward splenocytes. These results indicate that the two LTPs have more desirable activities than the chitinase and that there is a dissociation between the antifungal and other activities of these antifungal proteins. 
8588878	19960101	Phytochemistry	D003160 D016428 	Inhibition of chitinolytic activities from tree species and associated fungi.	Effects of two inhibitors, allosamidin and (2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino phenylcarbamate (PUGNAC), have been assessed on chitinolytic activities of two plants, Pinus sylvestris L. and Eucalyptus pilularis Sm., and of seven fungi. Pinus sylvestris and E. pilularis root endochitinase activities were inhibited by allosamidin. Activities of P. sylvestris were more sensitive to inhibition than those of E. pilularis. The mechanism of inhibition varied with the plant species and the enzyme involved. PUGNAC inhibited beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and exochitinase activities in root extracts from both plant species. In all cases PUGNAC acted as a reversible competitive inhibitor. Both inhibitors also affected chitinolytic activities from the fungi screened. Allosamidin inhibited endochitinase activities from both the mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi tested. In addition, exochitinase activity from the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr. was inhibited by allosamidin. PUGNAC inhibited beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity from all the fungi tested. PUGNAC was also a potent inhibitor of both exo- and endochitinase activities from the fungi, except P. involutus. Competitive inhibition was the most common form. These findings show allosamidin does inhibit endochitinase activity in plants and the ability of PUGNAC to inhibit not only beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity but also fungal endochitinase activity may be useful to distinguish between host and fungal endochitinase activities in symbiotic or pathogenic dual systems.

D016428 D013485 	G protein-cAMP signaling pathway mediated by PGA3 plays different roles in regulating the expressions of amylases and cellulases in Penicillium decumbens.	Heterotrimeric G proteins (G proteins) have been extensively investigated for their regulatory functions in morphogenesis and development in filamentous fungi. In addition, G proteins were also shown to be involved in the regulation of cellulase expression in some fungi. Here, we report the different regulatory effects of PGA3, a group III G protein α subunit, on the expressions of amylases and cellulases in Penicillium decumbens. Deletion of pga3 resulted in impaired amylase production and significantly decreased transcription of the major amylase gene amy15A. Supplementation of exogenous cAMP or its analog dibutyryl-cAMP restored amylase production in Δpga3 strain, suggesting an essential role of PGA3 in amylase synthesis via controlling cAMP level. On the other hand, the transcription of major cellulase gene cel7A-2 increased, nevertheless cellulase activity in the medium was not affected, in Δpga3. The above regulatory effects of PGA3 are carbon source-independent, and are achieved, at least, by cAMP-mediated regulation of the expression level of transcription factor AmyR. The functions of PGA3 revealed by gene deletion were partially supported by the analysis of the mutant carrying dominantly-activated PGA3. The results provided new insights into the understanding of the physiological functions of G protein-cAMP pathway in filamentous fungi.

During the mating process of yeast cells, two Ca2+ influx pathways become activated. The resulting elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ activates downstream signaling factors that promote long term survival of unmated cells, but the roles of Ca2+ in conjugation have not been described. The high affinity Ca2+ influx system is composed of Cch1p and Mid1p and sensitive to feedback inhibition by calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase. To identify components and regulators of the low affinity Ca2+ influx system (LACS), we screened a collection of pheromone-responsive genes that when deleted lead to defects in LACS activity but not high affinity Ca2+ influx system activity. Numerous factors implicated in polarized morphogenesis and cell fusion (Fus1p, Fus2p, Rvs161p, Bni1p, Spa2p, and Pea2p) were found to be necessary for LACS activity. Each of these factors was also required for activation of the cell integrity mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade during the response to alpha-factor. Interestingly a polytopic plasma membrane protein, Fig1p, was required for LACS activity but not required for activation of Mpk1p mitogen-activated protein kinase. Mpk1p was not required for LACS activity, suggesting Mpk1p and Fig1p define two independent branches in the pheromone response pathways. Fig1p-deficient mutants exhibit defects in the cell-cell fusion step of mating, but unlike other fus1 and fus2 mutants the fusion defect of fig1 mutants can be largely suppressed by high Ca2+ conditions, which bypass the requirement for LACS. These findings suggest Fig1p is an important component or regulator of LACS and provide the first evidence for a role of Ca2+ signals in the cell fusion step of mating.

A gene (lsd1) encoding dextranase from Lipomyces starkeyi KSM22 has been previously cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene consisting of 1,824 base pairs and encoding a protein of 608 amino acids was then cloned into and secretively expressed in Pichia pastoris under the control of the AOX1 promoter. The dextranase productivity of the P. pastoris transformant (pPIC9K-LSD1, 134,000 U/l) was approximately 4.2-fold higher than that of the S. cerevisiae transformant (pYLSD1, 32,000 U/l) cultured in an 8-l fermentor. Over 0.63 g/l of active dextranase was secreted into the medium after methanol induction. The dextranase of the P. pastoris transformant, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, showed only one homogeneous band. This dextranase of the P. pastoris transformant showed a broad band near 73 kDa. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against a synthetic LSD1 peptide mix also recognized approximately 73 kDa. 
12228518	19950701	Plant_Physiol.	D016428 	Primary Metabolism in Plant Defense (Regulation of a Bean Malic Enzyme Gene Promoter in Transgenic Tobacco by Developmental and Environmental Cues).	NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME, EC 1.1.1.40) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate, producing CO2 and NADPH. We have examined regulatory properties of a 2.8-kb promoter-leader fragment of a bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) NADP-ME gene (PvME1) predicted to encode a cytosolic form of the enzyme by expression analysis of promoter-[beta]-glucuronidase fusions in transgenic tobacco plants. The PvME1 promoter directed strong expression in stems, which was confined to vascular and pith tissues, and was also active in floral and reproductive tissues. Wounding caused a marked induction of promoter activity, which was further strongly enhanced upon application of stimuli related to pathogen defense. Glutathione (reduced form) was the strongest inducer, but oxidized glutathione, fungal elicitor, cellulase, catalase, ascorbic acid, and NADPH were additional potent promoter-stimulating agents. Responsiveness to reduced glutathione was also shown at the level of PvME1 mRNA accumulation in bean plants. The putative contributions of NADP-ME gene expression to the plant defense response and possible mechanisms of defense gene regulation by conditions of oxidative stress as well as by H2O2 and antioxidant levels are discussed.

Cloning, sequencing and functional analysis of the Kluyveromyces lactis KlHEM12 gene and its upstream region are reported. The gene encodes for a protein that is highly homologous to uroporphyrinogen decarboxylases from different organisms and complements its mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Secondary structure prediction allows outlining a topology diagram which is compatible with a (beta/alpha)8-barrel structure. A K. lactis haploid strain carrying a null allele of KlHEM12 showed decreased growth in media not supplemented with hemin (ferriprotoporphyrin IX) and red-fluorescent colonies due to the accumulation of porphyrins. KlHEM12 expression was analysed by Northern blot and promoter fusion to the reporter lacZ gene. Transcription of this gene is not under heme or glucose repression and it is slightly induced by non-fermentable carbon sources through the Hap2/3/4/5 complex. 
19208239	20090212	Biotechnol_Biofuels	D016428 	Enhanced ethanol production from brewer's spent grain by a Fusarium oxysporum consolidated system.	Brewer's spent grain (BG), a by-product of the brewing process, is attracting increasing scientific interest as a low-cost feedstock for many biotechnological applications. BG in the present study is evaluated as a substrate for lignocellulolytic enzyme production and for the production of ethanol by the mesophilic fungus Fusarium oxysporum under submerged conditions, implementing a consolidated bioconversion process. Fermentation experiments were performed with sugar mixtures simulating the carbohydrate content of BG in order to determine the utilization pattern that could be expected during the fermentation of the cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysate of BG. The sugar mixture fermentation study focused on the effect of the initial total sugar concentration and on the effect of the aeration rate on fermenting performance of F. oxysporum. The alkali pretreatment of BG and different aeration levels during the ethanol production stage were studied for the optimization of the ethanol production by F. oxysporum. Enzyme yields as high as 550, 22.5, 6.5, 3225, 0.3, 1.25 and 3 U per g of carbon source of endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-D-glucosidase, xylanase, feruloyl esterase, beta-D-xylosidase and alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase respectively, were obtained during the growth stage under optimized submerged conditions. An ethanol yield of 109 g ethanol per kg of dry BG was obtained with alkali-pretreated BG under microaerobic conditions (0.01 vvm), corresponding to 60% of the theoretical yield based on total glucose and xylose content of BG. The enzymatic profile of the extracellular extract from F. oxysporum submerged cultures using BG and corn cob as the carbon source was proved efficient for a successful hydrolysis of BG. The fermentation study carried out using sugar mixtures simulating BG's carbohydrates content and consecutively alkali-pretreated and untreated BG, indicates that BG hydrolysis is the bottleneck of the bioconversion process. However, a considerable bioconversion yield was achieved (60% of the theoretical) making this bioprocess worthy of further investigation for a potential commercial application.

D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487 	Changes in the activity and properties of trehalase during early germination of yeast ascospores: correlation with trehalose breakdown as studied by in vivo 13C NMR.	The regulation of trehalose breakdown during dormancy and the induction of germination in yeast ascospores was studied both by in vivo high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and in vitro assays of trehalase activity. Natural-abundance (13)C NMR spectra taken during the induction of germination with glucose and phosphate showed a rapid breakdown of part of the trehalose content. The presence of both glucose and phosphate was important for maximal trehalose breakdown. The (13)C NMR spectra showed that the externally added glucose and the internal trehalose were metabolized mainly to glycerol and ethanol. Under these conditions of nitrogen deprivation, full germination is not possible and trehalose breakdown stopped after approximately 1 hr. At this moment resynthesis of trehalose occurred while glycerol and ethanol production from the exogenous glucose continued. In complex media where full spore germination can occur, trehalose breakdown was more pronounced. Measurements of trehalase activity in spore extracts made after addition of varying amounts of glucose and phosphate to the spores revealed a sudden 10-fold increase in the activity of trehalase, within the first minutes of spore germination. The activation was transient: after reaching a maximum between 5 and 10 min, the activity declined back to low values during the next hours. The increase in trehalase activity was not inhibited by cycloheximide or by anaerobic conditions. The decline in trehalase activity that occurred after the initial activation could be correlated with the extent of trehalose breakdown as measured by (13)C NMR. In addition to the increase in trehalase activity, differences in the control properties were found between the enzymes from dormant and germinating spores. Trehalase from dormant spores was strongly inhibited by ATP at a concentration of approximately 0.5 mM, which corresponds with the ATP concentration found in dormant spores. On the other hand, trehalase from germinating spores was not inhibited by ATP up to the much higher ATP concentrations that are found in germinating spores. It is suggested that the low activity and the stringent ATP feedback inhibition of trehalase from dormant spores are responsible for the very slow mobilization of the huge amount of trehalose in dormant spores. Therefore, dormancy seems to be caused primarily by extreme curtailment of the energy production within the spore at one selective and primary point. The switch towards high activity and low ATP inhibition upon induction of germination is suggested to be responsible for the breaking of dormancy and for the rapid breakdown of trehalose that occurs during the initial phase of germination. 
14595695	20031105	Electrophoresis	D016428 	Impact of prefractionation using Gradiflow on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry.	Prefractionation of protein samples prior to two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) has the potential to increase the dynamic detection range for proteomic analysis. We evaluated a membrane-based electrophoretic separation technique (Gradiflow) for its ability to fractionate an exoproteome sample from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. The sample was separated on the basis of size and charge. Buffer optimization was found to be necessary for successful size fractionation. Fractionation by charge was used to resolve the sample into four fractions that were subjected to analysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Enhanced detection of low-abundance proteins with selective removal of high-abundance species was achieved. Fractionated and unfractionated samples were examined for differences in the ability to identify proteins following 2-DE using trypsin in-gel digestion followed by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Fractionated samples showed marked improvement in protein identification ability and sequence coverage. This study demonstrates the utility of the Gradiflow for fractionation, resulting in an enhancement of resolution and characterization of a moderately complex proteome. 
15950156	20050614	Fungal_Genet._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Isolation and characterization of the Aspergillus nidulans eglC gene encoding a putative beta-1,3-endoglucanase.	The Aspergillus nidulans eglC gene, which encodes a putative beta-1,3-endoglucanase, was isolated from a chromosome-specific library by using an expressed sequence tag, esd0113. The EglC open reading frame encodes a 465 amino acid polypeptide, of which the amino acid sequence showed 46% similarity to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae beta-1,3-endoglucanase. The eglC transcript level at the early stages of asexual and sexual developments was dependent on the presence of the nsdD gene that encodes a GATA-type transcription factor, confirming that the nsdD gene is necessary for full accumulation of the eglC transcript. Deletion of the eglC gene did not affect the radial growth rate, the germination rate of conidia, and both of asexual and sexual development. However, deletion of the gene led to hyphae more resistant to a cell wall-lyzing enzyme, implying that the cell wall structure of the eglC-null mutant is altered from a wild type one. Furthermore, deletion of the fadA and sfaD genes, that encode a Galpha and a Gbeta subunits of a heterotrimeric G protein, respectively, did not affect the eglC transcript level at the early developmental stages. In contrast, deletion of the flbA gene, that codes for a regulatory protein having an RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) motif, led to decrease in the eglC transcript level. The eglC transcript level was not higher in a creA mutant than in a wild type, indicating that the eglC gene is not sensitive to carbon-catabolite repression. 
8298281	19930101	Arch._Med._Res.	D016428 D016454 	Biosynthesis of cell wall and septum during yeast growth.	The primary septum that forms in yeast cells at cytokinesis consists of the polysaccharide chitin. Three chitin synthetases (Chs1, Chs2 and Chs3) have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cloning and disruption of the respective genes showed that Chs3 is responsible for the formation of a chitin ring at the base of an emerging bud and of chitin dispersed in the cell wall, whereas Chs2 catalyzes the synthesis of a chitin disc that completes the primary septum. Chs1 acts as a repair enzyme, replenishing chitin lost through excessive action of a chitinase that facilitates cell separation by degrading part of the septum. The major structural polysaccharide of the yeast cell wall is beta(1->3)glucan. The glucan synthetase complex is bound to the plasma membrane. By differential extraction of the membranes with salt and detergents two solubilized fractions have been obtained which are required, in addition to GTP, for glucan synthesis. Further purification of one of these fractions led to results that indicate a role for other proteins in the modulation of GTP stimulation. A G-protein system appears to function in the regulation of beta(1->3) glucan and cell wall formation in vivo. 
8660508	19960501	Anal._Biochem.	D016428 	A microassay for measuring glycogen in 96-well-cultured cells.	This study describes a rapid, sensitive, and automated spectrophotometric enzymatic microassay that measures the intracellular glycogen of primary cultured hepatocytes and other cultured cells in 96-well plates and can be adapted for other samples that are transferred to these plates. The procedure involves in situ disruption of cells, followed by hydrolysis of glycogen into glucosyl units by fungal glucoamylase (exo-1.4-alpha-glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.3), and glucose determination with the glucose oxidase colorimetric method. The color intensity can be measured in conventional ELISA readers, and the data can be fed to an on-line computer for rapid processing. The advantages of this method are its simplicity and automation, the reduction in sample handling, and the small number of cells required compared to other conventional methods.

Branching and other cell wall softening events in fungi and oomycetes are thought to involve the activity of secreted enzymes, which are packaged in membrane vesicles and delivered to sites of cell expansion, there to work in a carefully regulated manner upon the structure of the wall. Here we demonstrate a latent endo-(1,4)-beta-glucanase activity in a mixed membrane fraction of the oomycete Achlya ambisexualis, which can be released by cysteine proteases with an increase of apparent activity. In addition, a similar endogenous process is strongly inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitor iodoacetamide, while inhibitors of other types of proteases have a much smaller effect. Detergent treatment of membranes releases two glucanases detectable by electrophoretic activity staining, with apparent molecular masses of about 164 and 35 kDa. Proteolysis produces several activity bands, with major species having apparent molecular masses of about 149, 133, 48, 35, and 25 kDa. The ca. 35- and 25-kDa bands migrate in parallel with glucanases secreted during wall softening in vivo. We propose that the initiation of wall softening in Achlya involves the proteolytic processing and solubilization of at least some secreted endoglucanases. We also propose that the solubilization component of this process functions not just to provide the enzymes with access to wall matrix substrates but also may provide a mechanism for the eventual termination of their biological function.

D016428 D013485 	Crystal structure of basic 7S globulin, a xyloglucan-specific endo-β-1,4-glucanase inhibitor protein-like protein from soybean lacking inhibitory activity against endo-β-glucanase.	β-Linked glucans such as cellulose and xyloglucan are important components of the cell walls of most dicotyledonous plants. These β-linked glucans are constantly exposed to degradation by various endo-β-glucanases from pathogenic bacteria and fungi. To protect the cell wall from degradation by such enzymes, plants secrete proteinaceous endo-β-glucanases inhibitors, such as xyloglucan-specific endo-β-1,4-glucanase inhibitor protein (XEGIP) in tomato. XEGIPs typically inhibit xyloglucanase, a member of the glycoside hydrolase (GH)12 family. XEGIPs are also found in legumes, including soybean and lupin. To date, tomato XEGIP has been well studied, whereas XEGIPs from legumes are less well understood. Here, we determined the crystal structure of basic 7S globulin (Bg7S), a XEGIP from soybean, which represents the first three-dimensional structure of XEGIP. Bg7S formed a tetramer with pseudo-222 symmetry. Analytical centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography experiments revealed that the assembly of Bg7S in solution depended on pH. The structure of Bg7S was similar to that of a xylanase inhibitor protein from wheat (Tritinum aestivum xylanase inhibitor) that inhibits GH11 xylanase. Surprisingly, Bg7S lacked inhibitory activity against not only GH11 but also GH12 enzymes. In addition, we found that XEGIPs from azukibean, yardlongbean and mungbean also had no impact on the activity of either GH12 or GH11 enzymes, indicating that legume XEGIPs generally do not inhibit these enzymes. We reveal the structural basis of why legume XEGIPs lack this inhibitory activity. This study will provide significant clues for understanding the physiological role of Bg7S.

At phase boundaries, physical activities of enzymes such as substrate complexation play critical roles in driving biocatalysis. A prominent example is the cellulase cocktails secreted by fungi and bacteria for deconstructing crystalline cellulose in biomass into soluble sugars. At interfaces, molecular mechanisms of the physical steps in biocatalysis remain elusive due to the difficulties of characterizing protein action with high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we focus on endoglucanase I (Cel7B) from the fungus  Trichoderma reesei  that hydrolyzes glycosidic bonds on cellulose randomly. We employ all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the interactions of the catalytic domain (CD) of Cel7B with a cellulose microfibril before and after complexing a glucan chain in the binding cleft. The calculated mechanical coupling networks in Cel7B-glucan and Cel7B-microfibril complexes reveal a previously unresolved allosteric coupling at the solid-liquid interface: attachment of the Cel7B CD to the cellulose surface affects glucan chain clenching in the binding cleft. Alternative loop segments of the Cel7B CD were found to affix to intact or defective surface structures on the microfibril, depending on the complexation state. From a multiple sequence alignment, residues in surface-affixing segments show strong conservation, highlighting the functional importance of the physical activities that they facilitate. Surface-affixing residues also demonstrate significant sequence correlation with active-site residues, revealing the functional connection between complexation and hydrolysis. Analysis of the Cel7B CD exemplifies that the mechanical coupling networks calculated from atomistic MD simulations can be used to capture the conservation and correlation in sequence alignment.

In this study, the effects of inositol addition on expression of the MAL gene encoding maltase and phosphatidylinositol (PI) biosynthesis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (a naturally inositol-requiring strain) were examined. We found that specific maltase activity was at its maximum when the concentration of added inositol reached 6 microg ml(-1) in a synthetic medium containing 2.0% (w/v) glucose. When the concentration of added inositol was 1 microg ml(-1) in the medium, repression of MAL gene expression occurred at glucose concentration higher than 0.2% (w/v). However, when S. pombe was cultured in the synthetic medium containing 6 microg ml(-1), repression of maltase gene expression occurred only at initial glucose concentration above 1.0% (w/v). More mRNA encoding maltase was detected in the cells grown in the medium with 6 microg ml(-1) inositol than in those grown in the same medium with 1 microg ml(-1) inositol. These results demonstrate that higher inositol concentrations in the synthetic medium could derepress MAL gene expression in S. pombe. PI content of the yeast cells grown in the synthetic medium with 6 microg ml(-1) of inositol was higher than that of the yeast cells grown in the same medium with 1 microg ml(-1) of inositol. This means that PI may be involved in the derepression of MAL gene expression in S. pombe.

The baking additives xylanase and cellulase were described as baking additives causing baker's asthma. It is not known whether monosensitization to these enzymes may occur. We present a case report of a baker with work-related asthma evaluated by skin prick test (SPT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EAST), immunoblot, EAST and immunoblot inhibition, and specific bronchial challenge. Fungal xylanase and alpha-amylase were measured by two-site enzyme immunoassays in products used by the patient at work. Allergy to xylanase and cellulase was demonstrated by SPT, EAST, immunoblot and specific bronchial challenge (for xylanase only). No sensitization to alpha-amylase could be demonstrated, but there was a weak flour allergy as documented by EAST and immunoblot and a positive occupational-type challenge with high concentrations of rye flour. Four baking additives contained measurable amounts of fungal alpha-amylase and xylanase, without a correlation between these enzymes. We conclude that occupational asthma due to the baking additives xylanase and cellulase may occur without concomitant sensitization to alpha-amylase and only weak sensitization to flour.

Growth and concomitant production of an extracellular pectin lyase (PL) [poly(methoxylgalactosiduronate) endolyase; EC 4.2.2.10] were investigated in a group of 16 fungi grown in liquid medium containing pectin as a supplementary carbon source. Culture filtrates of both Penicillium italicum (CECT 2294) and P. expansum (CECT 2275) showed the highest PL activity and contained polygalacturonase but not pectinesterase activity. The effect of the inoculum size, the carbon source (sucrose and glucose syrup), and the presence of pectin on the production of PL by P. italicum was studied. The presence of 2.6 mM glycerophosphate in the culture medium enhanced the appearance of PL but was not inhibitory for the in vitro activity. However, glycerol inhibited the enzyme nearly 50% at such a concentration.

Insufficient accumulation and the lack of efficient purification methods are the two major bottlenecks hindering the recombinant production of many proteins. Alternative production schemes are urgently needed for proteins that remain challenging to express and purify with conventional techniques. We have found that hydrophobin fusions targeted to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can enhance the expression of target proteins simultaneously providing means for straightforward purification. Here we show that hydrophobin fusion technology induces formation of large protein bodies in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. The fusion protein remained soluble in the ER-derived protein bodies. A simple and scalable aqueous two-phase system was demonstrated to purify the hydrophobin fusion protein GFP-HFBI from the complex intracellular extracts with a recovery of up to 62%.

Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants expressing a fungal PG (PG plants) have a reduced content of homogalacturonan. Here, we show that PG plants are more resistant to microbial pathogens and have constitutively activated defense responses. Interestingly, either in tobacco PG or wild-type plants treated with OGs, resistance to fungal infection is suppressed by exogenous auxin, whereas sensitivity to auxin of PG plants is reduced in different bioassays. The altered plant defense responses and auxin sensitivity in PG plants may reflect an increased accumulation of OGs and subsequent antagonism of auxin action. Alternatively, it may be a consequence of perturbations of cellular physiology and elevated defense status as a result of altered cell wall architecture. 
405328	19770501	Infect._Immun.	D016428 	Antigenic, chemical, and structural properties of cell walls of Histoplasma capsulatum yeast-form chemotypes 1 and 2 after serial enzymatic hydrolysis.	Cell walls of Histoplasma capsulatum yeast-form chemotypes 1 (chem 1) and 2 (chem 2) treated sequentially with several polysaccharolytic enzymes and Pronase yielded soluble, nondialyzable polysaccharides at each step, which were analyzed for monosaccharides, protein composition, and serological activity. Polysaccharide recovered after digestion of chem 1 walls with beta(1-->3)-glucanase contained glucose > mannose > glucosamine > galactose. This fraction (chem 1 betaG(1)) was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contained a component having an apparent molecular weight of 120,000. The chem 1 betaG(1) fraction was reactive in immunodiffusion (ID), producing an immune precipitate not identical to the H and M factors of histoplasmin. In a side-by-side ID comparison with extracts of chem 2, the chem 1 betaG(1) antigen contained an additional determinant not found in chem 2 extracts when tested with goat antiserum to H. capsulatum. Therefore, the chem 1 antigen gave preliminary ID evidence of antigenic group specificity. A chemical difference observed was the absence of glucosamine from chem 2 polysaccharide. In complement fixation (CF) tests, 9 of 17 sera from human histoplasmosis patients reacted with chem 1 betaG(1), but some cross-reactivity with sera of patients with other systemic mycoses occurred. The immunoelectrophoretic patterns of chem 1 wall-derived polysaccharides showed a marked shift in mobility after Pronase digestion, implying the presence of covalent peptides. The ultrastructural appearance and serological activity of intact walls and enzyme-resistant mural cores were also studied. The surface of the mural cores of both chemotypes was perforated and frayed. In shadow-cast preparations both fibrillar and globular areas persisted in the mural cores. The CF end point serum dilutions showed an increase after alpha- and beta-glucanase extractions of chem 2 walls and fourfold reduction after Pronase digestion. The mural cores of both chemotypes were still reactive in CF tests and retained some ability to bind fluorescent antibody. The chem 1 mural core reacted with specific fluorescein-labeled H. capsulatum antiglobulins produced by adsorption with Blastomyces dermatitidis, thus indicating at least partial retention of H. capsulatum-specific factors. The presence of galactose, mannose, and glucose was detected in the mural cores as well as enriched levels of amino sugar, despite exposure to chitinase. 
4039269	19850415	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Studies of the cellulolytic system of Trichoderma reesei QM 9414. Reaction specificity and thermodynamics of interactions of small substrates and ligands with the 1,4-beta-glucan cellobiohydrolase II.	The 1,4-beta-glucan cellobiohydrolase II (CBH II) from Trichoderma reesei QM 9414 catalyses the hydrolysis of the 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-glycosides derived from cellotriose, cellotetraose and cellopentaose [MeUmb(Glc)n; n = 3 - 5]. The reaction has been followed by quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography. Specific activity for cellobiose removal at apparent substrate saturation were determined as (0.8 +/- 0.2) min-1 for MeUmb(Glc)3 and (9 +/- 2) min-1 for MeUmb(Glc)4. The enzyme showed a deviant specificity with MeUmb(Glc)5 as substrate. Two chromophoric products were formed simultaneously [MeUmb(Glc)3 and MeUmb(Glc)2] with turn-over numbers (17 +/- 4) min-1 and (21 +/- 6) min-1, respectively. Methylumbelliferyl beta-glucoside (MeUmbGlc) and the corresponding cellobioside [MeUmb(Glc)2] were used in equilibrium binding experiments. Both ligands yielded one binding site per molecule of Mr = 54000 upon forced flow dialysis (diafiltration). The association constants found were in fair agreement with those determined from MeUmb fluorescence quenching titrations. Quenching was total at all temperatures investigated for MeUmb(Glc)2, whereas for MeUmbGlc it increased from 80% to 100% between 2 degrees C and 20 degrees C. The association constants fitted linear van't Hoff plots in both cases. MeUmb(Glc)2 and MeUmbGlc were also used as indicator ligands to determine the association constants and thermodynamic parameters of several non-chromophoric ligands of CBH II. The binding of glucose increased the affinity for MeUmb(Glc)2 whereas it displaced MeUmbGlc from its complex. A putative binding site of the CBH II containing four subsites can be proposed. The thermodynamic data for methyl beta-D-glucopyranoside and cellobiose as ligands also point at an extended binding site.

A 850 bp fragment of the 5' flanking region of the glucoamylase gene (glaA) was synthesized from A. niger T21 genome using PCR. The function detection vector was constructed by fusing this fragment to E. coli hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hph) and was used to transform A. niger. The high hygromycin resistance transformants thus obtained verified that the synthesized fragment functioned as a promoter in filamentous fungi. Southern blot analysis showed the hph gene has been integrated into genomic DNA of A. niger transformant. 
23450755	20130302	J._Sci._Food_Agric.	D016428 	Performance of wood-rotting fungi-based enzymes on enzymic saccharification of rice straw.	For effective saccharification of rice straw we focused on enzyme preparations from wood-rotting fungi that have the ability to degrade cell wall polysaccharides and lignin. We tested extracellular enzyme preparations from 14 species of fungi for saccharification activity and examined the factor for saccharification by statistical analysis. An enzyme preparation from Schizophyllum commune had the highest saccharification activity of rice straw. This preparation contained highly active endo-β-xylanase, endo-β-glucanase (CMCase), β-d-glucosidase and acetylxylan esterase. Correlation analysis of the 14 enzyme preparations demonstrated that acetylxylan esterase was closely related to saccharification activity in rice straw. Multiple regression analysis also showed that acetylxylan esterase had an important role in saccharification. Ligninolytic enzymes, which are characteristic of white-rot fungi, did not contribute to saccharification activity of rice straw. Deacetylation is an essential factor for saccharification of rice straw and enzyme preparations for saccharification need to contain highly active acetylxylan esterase as well as highly active cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes, but not ligninolytic ones. 
21821740	20110809	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013486 	Oxidoreductive cellulose depolymerization by the enzymes cellobiose dehydrogenase and glycoside hydrolase 61.	Several members of the glycoside hydrolase 61 (GH61) family of proteins have recently been shown to dramatically increase the breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass by microbial hydrolytic cellulases. However, purified GH61 proteins have neither demonstrable direct hydrolase activity on various polysaccharide or lignacious components of biomass nor an apparent hydrolase active site. Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is a secreted flavocytochrome produced by many cellulose-degrading fungi with no well-understood biological function. Here we demonstrate that the binary combination of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A (TaGH61A) and Humicola insolens CDH (HiCDH) cleaves cellulose into soluble, oxidized oligosaccharides. TaGH61A-HiCDH activity on cellulose is shown to be nonredundant with the activities of canonical endocellulase and exocellulase enzymes in microcrystalline cellulose cleavage, and while the combination of TaGH61A and HiCDH cleaves highly crystalline bacterial cellulose, it does not cleave soluble cellodextrins. GH61 and CDH proteins are coexpressed and secreted by the thermophilic ascomycete Thielavia terrestris in response to environmental cellulose, and the combined activities of T. terrestris GH61 and T. terrestris CDH are shown to synergize with T. terrestris cellulose hydrolases in the breakdown of cellulose. The action of GH61 and CDH on cellulose may constitute an important, but overlooked, biological oxidoreductive system that functions in microbial lignocellulose degradation and has applications in industrial biomass utilization. 
22528646	20120425	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Sago pith residue as an alternative cheap substrate for fermentable sugars production.	Sago pith residue is one of the most abundant lignocellulosic biomass which can serve as an alternative cheap substrate for fermentable sugars production. This residue is the fibrous waste left behind after the starch extraction process and contains significant amounts of starch (58%), cellulose (23%), hemicellulose (9.2%) and lignin (3.9%). The conversion of sago pith residue into fermentable sugars is commonly performed using cellulolytic enzymes or known as cellulases. In this study, crude cellulases were produced by two local isolates, Trichoderma asperellum UPM1 and Aspergillus fumigatus, UPM2 using sago pith residue as substrate. A. fumigatus UPM2 gave the highest FPase, CMCase and β-glucosidase activities of 0.39, 23.99 and 0.78 U/ml, respectively, on day 5. The highest activity of FPase, CMCase and β-glucosidase by T. asperellum UPM1 was 0.27, 12.03 and 0.42 U/ml, respectively, on day 7. The crude enzyme obtained from A. fumigatus UPM2 using β-glucosidase as the rate-limiting enzyme (3.9, 11.7 and 23.4 IU) was used for the saccharification process to convert 5% (w/v) sago pith residue into reducing sugars. Hydrolysis of sago pith residue using crude enzyme containing β-glucosidase with 23.4 IU, produced by A. fumigatus UPM2 gave higher reducing sugars production of 20.77 g/l with overall hydrolysis percentage of 73%. 
1603074	19920501	Mol._Gen._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAM2/SIN3 protein plays a role in both activation and repression of transcription.	We have cloned GAM2, which is required for transcription of STA1, a gene encoding an extracellular glucoamylase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. diastaticus. DNA sequence analysis revealed that GAM2 is the same gene as SIN3, known to be a general negative regulator of yeast genes. RNA blot analysis indicated that GAM2/SIN3 also acts as a positive regulator of GAM3/ADR6, which in turn is required for transcription of STA1 and ADH2. These results suggest that GAM2 regulates STA1 expression through transcriptional activation of GAM3 and indicate that GAM2/SIN3 protein is a transcriptional regulator that can play a role in both activation and repression of transcription. 
7393012	19800301	Mikrobiologiia	D004740 D016428 	[Microbiological processes in the ensiling of guza-paya by using cellulolytic enzymes].	The purpose of this work was to study how cellulolytic enzymes produced by the fungus Trichoderma lignorum 19 can be used in storing the silage of guza-paya, and how various doses of these enzymes influence the composition of microflora and the production of acids in the silage. When the silage of guza-paya is stored in the presence of a 5% preparation of cellolignorin Px, the polysaccharides of guza-paya are hydrolyzed under the action of cellulase and xylanase, and the monosaccharides being produced are used by lactic bacteria for their growth. As a result, the silage is conserved and enriched in protein, organic acids and other nutrient substances. The silage of high quality can be prepared by moistening guza-paya to 80--85% and by adding cellolignorin Px to 5% of the guza-paya weight. 
20532763	20100610	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	One-step purification and characterization of a beta-1,4-glucosidase from a newly isolated strain of Stereum hirsutum.	A highly efficient beta-1,4-glucosidase (BGL) secreting strain, Stereum hirsutum SKU512, was isolated and identified based on morphological features and sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer rDNA. A BGL containing a carbohydrate moiety was purified to homogeneity from S. hirsutum culture supernatants using only a single chromatography step on a gel filtration column. The relative molecular weight of S. hirsutum BGL was determined as 98 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or 780 kDa by size exclusion chromatography, indicating that the enzyme is an octamer. S. hirsutum BGL showed the highest activity toward p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (V (max) = 3,028 U mg-protein(-1), k (cat) = 4,945 s(-1)) ever reported. The enzyme also showed good stability at an acidic pH ranging from 3.0 to 5.5. The BGL was able to promote transglycosylation with an activity of 42.9 U mg-protein(-1) using methanol as an acceptor and glucose as a donor. The internal amino acid sequences of the isolated enzyme showed significant homology with hydrolases from glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1), indicating that the S. hirsutum BGL is a member of GH1 family. The characteristics of S. hirsutum BGL could prove to be of interest in several potential applications, especially in enhancing flavor release during the wine fermentation process. 
19184610	20090203	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 	Extracellular hemicellulolytic enzymes from the maize endophyte Acremonium zeae.	Microorganisms that colonize plants require a number of hydrolytic enzymes to help degrade the cell wall. The maize endophyte Acremonium zeae was surveyed for production of extracellular enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose. The most prominent enzyme activity in cell-free culture medium from A. zeae NRRL 6415 was xylanase, with a specific activity of 60 U/mg from cultures grown on crude corn fiber. Zymogram analysis following SDS-PAGE indicated six functional xylanase polypeptides of the following masses: 51, 44, 34, 29, 23, and 20 kDa. Xylosidase (0.39 U/mg), arabinofuranosidase (1.2 U/mg), endoglucanase (2.3 U/mg), cellobiohydrolase (1.3 U/mg), and beta-glucosidase (0.85 U/mg) activities were also detected. Although apparently possessing a full complement of hemicellulolytic activities, cell-free culture supernatants prepared from A. zeae required an exogenously added xylosidase to release more than 90% of the xylose and 80% of the arabinose from corn cob and wheat arabinoxylans. The hydrolytic enzymes from A. zeae may be suitable for application in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. 
10946836	20000818	Int._J._Food_Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Typing of non-Saccharomyces yeasts with enzymatic activities of interest in wine-making.	Enzymatic activity of potential interest in wine-making was studied for 182 non-Saccharomyces yeasts isolated from musts before and at the onset of fermentation at wine cellars operating under the La Mancha Appellation of Origin in Spain. Tests were carried out on plates containing differential substrates appropriate for each case (casein, gelatin, polygalacturonic acid, and arbutin) to determine whether each of the isolates exhibited proteolytic, polygalacturonase, and beta-glucosidase activities. Nearly 80% of the wild yeasts possessed one or more enzymes of biotechnological interest. Once the enzymatic activities of the isolates had been established, 69 of the isolates that exhibited pronounced enzymatic activity and 11 randomly selected isolates that were devoid of any activity were typed using PCR/RFLP, which gave 13 different molecular profiles. The isolates for each of the profiles were then identified by classical methods. The enzyme beta-glucosidase was linked to the species Metschnikowia pulcherrima, and polygalacturonase activity was common in most of the species identified. Proteolytic activity was observed in Pichia membranifaciens and in Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Typing revealed the possibility of intraspecific differences in Pichia membranifaciens, because six different molecular profiles with one or more shared restriction bands were recorded for that species. 
16209108	20051008	Pol._J._Microbiol.	D016428 	A potent chitinolytic activity of Alternaria alternata isolated from Egyptian black sand.	Eight fungal species characterized by chitinolytic activity were isolated from Egyptian black sand collected from Rosetta coast. Genus Aspergillus and Alternaria alternata exhibited the highest density (> 40% of the total count, each) on the isolation plates containing different treatments of native shrimp shell chitin. Genus Aspergillus was represented by A. flavus, A. niger, A. foetidus and A. tungius, with the former species being the most dominant. The other species were Cladosporium herbarum, Fusarium equisitum (5.71% of the total count, each) and Dendryphiella vinosa (3.21% of the total count). The isolated species were screened for chitinase production on agar plates containing 0.2% colloidal chitin. The chitinolytic activity of each individual was not always correlated with its density on the isolation plates. Alternaria alternata was the most promising species for chitinase excretion. The use of colloidal chitin (1.5%) as a sole carbon source was superior for the enzyme production by A. alternata. Maximum enzyme yield was obtained after 7 days incubation at 30 degrees C with shaking (150 rev min(-1)), with an initial pH value of the growth medium at 5.0. Presence of NaNO3 (0.3%), the best nitrogen source, and CaCl2 (100 microg/ml) stimulated the induction of the enzyme. The crude A. alternata chitinase revealed a potential insecticidal effect on the larvae of fruitfly (82% mortality) and could degrade crude shrimp shell waste. 
7866723	19940101	Acta_Microbiol_Immunol_Hung	D016428 	Functions of symbiotic fungus gardens in higher termites of the genus Macrotermes: evidence against the acquired enzyme hypothesis.	Behavioural, microbiological and biochemical studies on Macrotermes subhyalinus and M. michaelseni by collaborating laboratories in the U.K., Switzerland and Australia are described. Younger workers consume both primary forage and the conidia of a symbiotically associated fungus of the genus Termitomyces, but all workers produce a fully competent cellulase complex (endoglucanase + glucosidase) in the midgut which is clearly distinguishable from analogous enzymes in fungal tissues. Workers have a RQ of 1.0; although a bacterial flora is present, assessments of CH4/H2 efflux and intestinal VFAs suggest that respiration is sustained by aerobic carbohydrate dissimilation. Calculations based on estimates of food ingestion by workers and measurements of cellulase activity show that endogenous production of reducing sugars from polysaccharide is sufficient to sustain the observed metabolic rate. Conidia contain both cellulase and glucose at much higher concentrations than other fungal tissues, but the role and fate of these substances on entering the young worker guts is unknown. Older workers consume fully composted forage in which cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and lignin are all significantly degraded, with a corresponding increase in nitrogen content. 
20302895	20100323	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of a viral chitinase active against plant pathogens and herbivores from transgenic tobacco.	The Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus chitinase A (AcMNPV ChiA) is a chitinolytic enzyme with fungicidal and insecticidal properties. Its expression in transgenic plants enhances resistance against pests and fungal pathogens. We exploited tobacco for the production of a biologically active recombinant AcMNPV ChiA (rChiA), as such species is an alternative to traditional biological systems for large-scale enzyme production. The protein was purified from leaves using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by anion exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. Transgenic plants produced an estimated 14 mg kg(-1) fresh leaf weight, which represents 0.2% of total soluble proteins. The yield of the purification was about 14% (2 mg kg(-1) fresh leaf weight). The comparison between the biochemical and kinetic properties of the rChiA with those of a commercial Serratia marcescens chitinase A indicated that the rChiA was thermostable and more resistant at basic pH, two positive features for agricultural and industrial applications. Finally, we showed that the purified rChiA enhanced the permeability of the peritrophic membrane of larvae of two Lepidoptera (Bombyx mori and Heliothis virescens) and inhibited spore germination and growth of the phytopatogenic fungus Alternaria alternata. The data indicated that tobacco represents a suitable platform for the production of rChiA, an enzyme with interesting features for future applications as "eco-friendly" control agent in agriculture.

The molecular weight by SDS-PAGE (60 kDa) or Sephacryl S-200 filtration (105 kDa) suggested a homodimer. The carbohydrate content was 72%. Endoglycosidase H digestion resulted in one sharp band of 51.5 kDa in SDS-PAGE. pH and temperature optima were 4.5 and 45 degrees C, respectively. The isoelectric point was 6.69 and activation energy was 1.14 kcal mol(-1). The enzyme was stable for 1 h at 50 degrees C and decayed at 60 degrees C (t50 of 1.3 min.). Apparent KM for trealose was 0.2mM. Immunolocalisation studies showed the enzyme tightly packed at the surface of the cells.

The glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase A gene (exgA) from Aspergillus oryzae and fused to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae signal peptide (α-factor) was expressed under the control of either a constitutive (GAP) or an inducible (AOX1) promoter in Pichia pastoris. A 1.4-fold higher extracellular enzyme activity (2 U/ml) was obtained using the AOX1 inducible expression system than with the GAP constitutive promoter (1.4 U/ml). The purified recombinant ExgA enzyme, with a yield of 10 mg protein/l culture supernatant, was about 40 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis with a specific activity of 289 U/mg protein. The enzyme was optimally active at 35 °C and pH 5.0 and displayed a K(M) and V(max) of 0.56 mM and 10,042 μmol/(min mg protein), respectively, with p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside as the substrate. Moreover, it was tolerant to glucose inhibition with a K(i) of 365 mM.

Antarctic environments can sustain a great diversity of well-adapted microorganisms known as psychrophiles or psychrotrophs. The potential of these microorganisms as a resource of enzymes able to maintain their activity and stability at low temperature for technological applications has stimulated interest in exploration and isolation of microbes from this extreme environment. Enzymes produced by these organisms have a considerable potential for technological applications because they are known to have higher enzymatic activities at lower temperatures than their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts. A total of 518 Antarctic microorganisms, were isolated during Antarctic expeditions organized by the Instituto Antártico Uruguayo. Samples of particules suspended in air, ice, sea and freshwater, soil, sediment, bird and marine animal faeces, dead animals, algae, plants, rocks and microbial mats were collected from different sites in maritime Antarctica. We report enzymatic activities present in 161 microorganisms (120 bacteria, 31 yeasts and 10 filamentous fungi) isolated from these locations. Enzymatic performance was evaluated at 4 and 20°C. Most of yeasts and bacteria grew better at 20°C than at 4°C, however the opposite was observed with the fungi. Amylase, lipase and protease activities were frequently found in bacterial strains. Yeasts and fungal isolates typically exhibited lipase, celullase and gelatinase activities. Bacterial isolates with highest enzymatic activities were identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as Pseudomonas spp., Psychrobacter sp., Arthrobacter spp., Bacillus sp. and Carnobacterium sp. Yeasts and fungal strains, with multiple enzymatic activities, belonged to Cryptococcus victoriae, Trichosporon pullulans and Geomyces pannorum.

Isolation and characterization of a bacterial isolate (strain FP10) from banana rhizosphere with innate potential as fungal antagonist and microbial adjuvant in micropropagation of banana. Bacterium FP10 was isolated from the banana rhizosphere and identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa based on phenotypic, biochemical traits and sequence homology of partial 622-bp fragment of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicon, with the ribosomal database sequences. Strain FP10 displayed antibiosis towards fungi causing wilt and root necrosis diseases of banana. Production of plant growth hormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophores and phosphate-solubilizing enzyme in FP10 was determined. Strain FP10 tested negative for hydrogen cyanide, cellulase and pectinase, the deleterious traits for plant growth. Screening of antibiotic genes was carried out by polymerase chain reaction using gene-specific primers. Amplification of a 745-bp DNA fragment confirmed the presence of phlD, which is a key gene involved in the biosynthesis of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) in FP10. The antibiotic produced by FP10 was confirmed as DAPG using thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform infrared and tested for fungal antibiosis towards banana pathogens. Procedures for encapsulation of banana shoot tips with FP10 are described. Strain FP10 exhibited broad-spectrum antibiosis towards banana fungi causing wilt and root necrosis. DAPG by FP10 induced bulb formation and lysis of fungal mycelia. Encapsulation of banana shoot tips with FP10 induced higher frequency of germination (plantlet development) than nontreated controls on Murashige and Skoog basal medium. Treatment of banana plants with FP10 enhanced plant height and reduced the vascular discolouration as a result of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense FOC. Because of the innate potential of fungal antibiosis by DAPG antibiotic and production of siderophore, plant-growth-promoting IAA and phosphatase, the strain FP10 can be used as biofertilizer as well as a biocontrol agent.

Six xylan-hydrolyzing enzymes have been isolated from the preparations Celloviridin G20x and Xybeten-Xyl, obtained previously based on the strain Trichoderma longibrachiatum (Trichoderma reesei) TW-1. The enzymes isolated were represented by three xylanases (XYLs), XYL I (20 kDa, pi 5.5), XYL II (21 kDa, pI 9.5), XYL III (30 kDa, pI 9.1); endoglucanase I (EG I), an enzyme exhibiting xylanase activity (57 kDa, pI 4.6); and two exodepolymerases, beta-xylosidase (beta-XYL; 80 kDa, pI 4.5) and alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase I (alpha-L-AF I; 55 kDa, pI 7.4). The substrate specificity of the enzymes isolated was determined. XYL II exhibited maximum specific xylanase activity (190 U/mg). The content of the enzymes in the preparation was assessed. Maximum contributions to the total xylanase activities of the preparations Celloviridin G20x and Xy-beten-Xyl were made by EG I and XYL II, respectively. Effects of temperature and pH on the enzyme activities, their stabilities under various conditions, and the kinetics of exhaustive hydrolysis of glucuronoxylan and arabinoxylan were studied. Combinations of endodepolymerases (XYL I, XYL II, XYL III, or EG I) and exodepolymerases (alpha-L-AF I or beta-XYL) produced synergistic effects on arabinoxylan cleavage. The reverse was the case when endodepolymerases, such as XYL I or EG I, were combined with alpha-L-AF I. 
23066798	20121017	FEBS_J.	D016428 D013485 	Electron transport during aceticlastic methanogenesis by Methanosarcina acetivorans involves a sodium-translocating Rnf complex.	The anaerobic methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans lives under extreme energy limitation. Methanogenesis from acetate as carried out by M. acetivorans involves an anaerobic electron transport chain with ferredoxin as electron donor and heterodisulfide as electron acceptor, and so far only the heterodisulfide reductase has been shown to translocate H(+) . Here, we describe a second Na(+) -translocating coupling site in this electron transport chain. Inside-out membrane vesicles of M. acetivorans catalyzed Na(+)  transport coupled to an electron transport catalyzed by the ferredoxin:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase activity. Ionophore studies revealed that Na(+)  transport was primary and electrogenic. A ∆rnf mutant was unable to grow on acetate and the ferredoxin:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase-coupled Na(+)  transport was abolished. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Rnf complex of M. acetivorans is an Na(+) -translocating coupling site and the entry point of electrons derived from reduced ferredoxin into the electron transport chain leading to the heterodisulfide. 
7766156	19950501	Curr._Microbiol.	D016428 	Production of chitinase by Fusarium species.	The presence of chitinase activity without inducers in the enzymic precipitates from the culture fluid of 25-day-old autolyzed cultures of 17 Fusarium species has been studied. In all cases endochitinase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activities were found. The chitinase activity as a joint action of these two enzymes with production of N-acetylglucosamine was also determined. A correlation among endochitinase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and chitinase was always found. Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lini, F. subglutinans, and F. moniliforme were the best producers of chitinase activity. Fusarium species could be a good source of chitinases for production by fungi. 
19530718	20090618	J._Agric._Food_Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Direct enzymatic production of oligosaccharide mixtures from sugar beet pulp: experimental evaluation and mathematical modeling.	The potential of sugar beet pulp as raw material for neutral and acidic oligosaccharide production by direct enzymatic treatment was evaluated. The effect of the polygalacturonase to solid ratio (PGaseSR), cellulase activity to polygalacturonase activity ratio (CPGaseR), and reaction time (t) on several dependent variables (selected to quantify the mass of recovered liquors, the conversion of each polysaccharide into monosaccharides, and the conversion of each polysaccharide into oligomers) was studied. Mathematical models suitable for reproducing and predicting the experimental results were also developed. Operational conditions leading to a maximum oligomer production were calculated from models being PGaseSR = 10 U/g, CPGaseR = 0.725 filter paper units/U, and t = 12.82 h. Under these conditions, the models predicted that 906 kg of liquors containing 26.7 kg of oligosaccharides can be obtained from 100 kg of SBP, the distribution being as follows: 5.9 kg of glucooligosaccharides, 2.4 kg of galactooligosaccharides, 9.7 kg of arabinooligosaccharides, and 8.7 kg of oligogalacturonides. Therefore, this study demonstrated that pectic oligomers (for which prebiotic properties have been reported) can be obtained from SBP at high yield by direct enzymatic hydrolysis using mixtures of cellulases and pectinases. 
3913330	19851201	Anal._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Plate assay for determining the time of production of protease, cellulase, and pectinases by germinating fungal spores.	A new method for detecting enzymes produced by fungal spores during germination is described here. With this method, the production of enzymes such as protease, cellulase, or pectinase can be correlated with the extent of spore germination. Germination is studied in vitro on agar-based media containing protein, cellulose, or pectin. The spores are immobilized on a permeable membrane mounted on the substrate-containing medium. At various times after inoculation the membrane-bound spores are removed and the medium is stained. The extent of germination is assessed by microscopic examination of the spores and the presence of active hydrolytic enzymes is revealed by the staining. The staining methods are sensitive; detection limits are 1 X 10(-3) unit of cellulase; 2 X 10(-4) unit of protease; 3 X 10(-3) unit of pectin lyase; 3.5 units of polygalacturonase; 2 X 10(-3) unit of pectin methyl esterase. The method has been demonstrated by studying the production of enzymes by germinating conidia of Botrytis cinerea. Cellulase and protease were present before any spores germinated. Pectin lyase was first observed when at least 80% of the spores had germinated. Pectin methyl esterase and polygalacturonase were not produced by the spores. 
10747150	20000404	J._Clin._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Evaluation of phenotypic markers for selection and identification of Candida dubliniensis.	Candida dubliniensis is often associated with C. albicans in cultures. Easy-to-perform selective isolation procedures for these closely related species do not exist. Therefore, we evaluated previously described discriminatory phenotypic markers for C. dubliniensis. A total of 150 oral rinses from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients were cultured on CHROMagar Candida. Dark green colonies described as being indicative of C. dubliniensis and other green colonies, 170 in total, were isolated. Chlamydospore formation, intracellular beta-D-glucosidase activity, ability to grow at 42 degrees C, carbohydrate assimilation pattern obtained by the API ID 32C, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy were used for phenotypic characterization. Sequencing of the 5' end of the nuclear large-subunit (26S) ribosomal DNA gene was used for definitive species identification for C. dubliniensis. C. dubliniensis was found in 34% of yeast-colonized HIV-infected patients. The color of the colonies on CHROMagar Candida proved to be insufficient for selecting C. dubliniensis, since only 30 of 53 proven C. dubliniensis isolates showed a dark green color in primary cultures. The described typical chlamydospore formation can give only some indication of C. dubliniensis. The assimilation pattern proved to be insufficient to discriminate C. dubliniensis from C. albicans. All C. dubliniensis strains showed no or highly restricted growth at 42 degrees C and a lack of beta-D-glucosidase activity. Unfortunately, atypical C. albicans strains can also exhibit these phenotypic traits. FT-IR spectroscopy combined with hierarchical clustering proved to be as reliable as genotyping for discriminating the two species. 
7066427	19820201	Biokhimiia	D004740 D016428 	[Non-steady state kinetics for action of a multienzyme cellulase system toward insoluble cellulose].	A kinetic theory for multienzyme cellulase systems in non-steady state conditions (in relation to intermediate metabolites) of hydrolysis of insoluble cellulose has been developed. To verify the kinetic regularities obtained the action of 12 different cellulases from the fungi Trichoderma, Geotrichum and Aspergillus as well as from bacterial cells Thermomonospora sp. and Rapidase preparation has been studied with respect to ball milled cotton linters and microcrystalline cellulose. The experimental data were discussed in the framework of mechanism of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose suggest by us recently and the main routes for glucose and cellobiose formation from insoluble cellulose have been elucidated. The effects of concentrations of cellulase preparations and the initial substrate on (i) time lags for glucose formation, (ii) stationary rate of glucose formation, and (iii) kinetics of cellulose conversion to glucose at low and high conversion degrees, were studied. A theoretical analysis of maxima and inflection points on the kinetic curves for intermediates (oligosaccharides and cellobiose) was performed. The effects and intensity of stirring on the time lag values for glucose formation were studied and the relative role of kinetic and diffusional factors in this process was evaluated. The data obtained are unequivocally indicative of the common mechanism of conversion of cellulose to glucose by cellulase complexes irrespective of their source and composition. 
11024518	20001012	Enzyme_Microb._Technol.	D016428 	Avicel-adsorbable endoglucanase production by the thermophilic fungus Scytalidium thermophilum type culture Torula thermophila.	Scytalidium thermophilum type culture Torula thermophila was isolated from mushroom compost and the total cellulase, endoglucanase, Avicel-adsorbable endoglucanase activities, as well as the fungal biomass generation and cellulose utilisation were analyzed in shake flask cultures with Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose) as the carbon source. Results were compared with an industrial strain of Scytalidium thermophilum type culture Humicola insolens. The pH and temperature optima for endoglucanase activities during enzyme assays were also analyzed for both organisms and determined to be pH 6.0 and 65 degrees C for type culture Torula thermophila, and pH 6.5 and 60 degrees C for type culture Humicola insolens. Analysis of the effect of growth temperature showed that type culture T. thermophila can grow and produce cellulases in the range of 35 to 55 degrees C although 40 to 50 degrees C seemed to favor growth and cellulase production. Although 45 degrees C was found optimal for fungal growth, both the specific endoglucanase and Avicel-adsorbable endoglucanase activities (U/mg protein) as well as the percentage of Avicel-adsorbable endoglucanase activity reached maxima at 50 degrees C and were higher as compared to type culture H. insolens. Results indicate that type culture T. thermophila, with further optimisations, is of potential use in the industrial production of cellulases. 
12744513	20030515	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D016428 D013485 	Flagellin from an incompatible strain of Acidovorax avenae mediates H2O2 generation accompanying hypersensitive cell death and expression of PAL, Cht-1, and PBZ1, but not of Lox in rice.	Acidovorax avenae causes a brown stripe disease in monocot plants. We recently reported that a rice-incompatible strain of A. avenae caused hypersensitive cell death in rice and that the flagellin of the incompatible strain was involved in this response. The incompatible strain induced the rapid generation of H2O2 accompanying hypersensitive cell death and the expression of defense genes such as PAL, Cht-1, PBZ1, and LOX, whereas the compatible strain did not. The purified incompatible flagellin also induced the expression of PAL, Cht-1, and PBZ1, but LOX expression was not induced by the incompatible flagellin. PAL and LOX enzymatic activities were increased by inoculation with the incompatible strain, whereas only PAL activity was increased by the incompatible flagellin. Interestingly, the flagellin-deficient incompatible strain lost the ability to generate H2O2 and induce hypersensitive cell death, but PAL, Cht-1, and PBZ1 expression still were induced by inoculation with the deficient strain, suggesting that induction of these genes is regulated not only by flagellin but also by some other signal. Thus, the incompatible flagellin of A. avenae is a specific elicitor in rice, but it is not the only factor capable of inducing the rice defense system. 
20724213	20100821	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Bioprocess strategies for enhanced production of xylanase by Melanocarpus albomyces IITD3A on agro-residual extract.	The production of high titer xylanase without cellulase is required for prebleaching of pulps in pulp and paper industry. The mutant IITD3A of Melanocarpus albomyces developed from the spores of the wild type organism was used in this study. The statistical optimization of the process parameters by response surface methodology revealed that the production of xylanase was most affected by changes in the pH of the production medium which contained a soluble extract of wheat straw as the sole carbon source. When the pH of the production medium in a 14 L bioreactor was controlled on-line at 7.8, xylanase activity of 415 IU mL⁻¹ was obtained after 36 h fermentation. On cycling the pH between 7.8 and 8.2, the same activity could be attained in 24 h with an overall productivity of 16,670 IU L⁻¹ h⁻¹. The production of xylanase was also influenced by the fungus morphology; the activity being maximum when it exhibited pellet form at an agitation speed of 600 rpm. On optimization of aeration rate to 0.25 vvm, the xylanase activity further increased to 550 IU mL⁻¹ with a very high overall volumetric productivity of 22,000 IU L⁻¹ h⁻¹. Thus, a 5.2-fold enhancement in overall volumetric productivity of xylanase could be obtained by the mutant in comparison to that obtained on insoluble wheat straw. 
9511753	19980325	Gene	D016428 	Nucleotide sequence of an alternative glucoamylase-encoding gene (glaB) expressed in solid-state culture of Aspergillus oryzae.	The DNA (glaB) and a cDNA-encoding glucoamylase produced in solid-state culture of Aspergillus oryzae were cloned using oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes derived from internal amino acid sequences of the enzyme. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of a genomic DNA fragment with its cDNA showed the glaB gene carried three exons interrupted by two introns and had an open reading frame encoding 493 aa residues. The 5'-flanking region had a TATA box at nt -87 from the start codon and two putative CAAT sequences at nt -276 and -288. The glaB gene shared 57% homology at the aa level with the glaA gene which was cloned previously from A. oryzae. Interestingly, the glucoamylase encoded by the glaB gene had no C-terminal domain such as that proposed to have starch binding activity in Aspergillus glucoamylases. Introduction of cDNA of the glaB gene to Saccharomyces cerevisiae caused the secretion of active glucoamylase to culture medium and introduction of the glaB gene to A. oryzae increased glucoamylase productivity in solid-state culture. Northern blot analysis showed the glaB gene was expressed in solid-state culture, but not in submerged culture. 
19366713	20090416	Occup_Environ_Med	D023362 D016428 D016448 D013485 	Effect of an intervention aimed at reducing the risk of allergic respiratory disease in bakers: change in flour dust and fungal alpha-amylase levels.	We evaluated the effect on exposure of an intervention programme, which focused on risk education and providing information on good work practices. This intervention programme was enrolled as part of a Dutch covenant in the flour processing industry (industrial bakeries, flour mills, ingredient producers). Data from several measurement surveys collected pre- and post-intervention were used to evaluate changes in exposure over time. All datasets contained personal measurements analysed for flour dust and fungal alpha-amylase contents, and contextual information was available on process characteristics, work practice, and use of control measures. Changes in exposure over time varied substantially between sectors and jobs. For bakeries a modest downward annual trend of -2% was found for flour dust and -8% for amylase. For flour mills the annual trend for flour dust was -12%; no significant trend was observed for amylase. For ingredient producers results were generally non-significant but indicated a reduction in flour dust exposure and increase in fungal alpha-amylase exposure. Modest increase in use of control measures and proper work practices were reported in most sectors, especially the use of local exhaust ventilation and decreased use of compressed air. The magnitude of the observed reductions in exposure levels indicates that the sector-wide intervention strategy implemented during the covenant period had a limited overall effect. This indicates that a more rigorous approach is needed to substantially decrease the exposure levels to flour dust and related allergens and, respectively, the prevalence of associated occupational diseases. 
8258640	19931001	J._Biochem._Biophys._Methods	D016428 D013485 	Isoelectric focusing in a multicompartment electrolyzer with zwitterionic membranes, exemplified by purification of glucoamylase.	A highly purified preparation of glucoamylase G1 from Aspergillus niger was found, by isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH gradients, to contain a major form with a pI of 3.50 and a number of minor, more acidic and more basic contaminants. The major isoform was purified to homogeneity by recycling isoelectric focusing in a multicompartment electrolyzer, by confining this form in between two zwitterionic membranes, with pI 3.49 at the anodic side and pI 3.52 at the cathodic side. Recoveries were high (90%) and, notwithstanding the rather low operational pH, the electrosmotic flow was minimal and no protein precipitation occurred up to concentrations of 2.5 mg/ml (at the isoelectric point). The forms resolved in an analytical focusing gel were subjected to two types of in situ enzyme detections, by the glucose oxidase peroxidase (GOP) test and by the starch-iodine test. By both criteria all resolved zones exhibited enzyme activity, the GOP assay, however, following more closely the Coomassie blue stained protein profile. By computer modelling, it is shown that it is impossible to obtain linear pH gradients at such low pH values (pH 2.5-4.5 intervals) when the mixture has a low buffering power (beta = 2.0 mequiv.l-1 pH-1). When the beta power was gradually raised (beta = 4, beta = 6, beta = 8) the pH gradient became progressively linear until, in a recipe with beta = 10 mequiv.l-1 pH-1 full linearity of the pH gradient could be obtained. This is shown to be due to the substantial buffering power of bulk water in the pH 2.5-3.5 region. 
15054260	20040401	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Polykaryon formation using a swollen conidium of Trichoderma reesei.	The cellulolytic fungus, Trichoderma has oval and mononucleate conidia. When these conidia are incubated in a liquid medium, they begin to swell and their shape becomes spherical followed by an increase in inner space. In such swollen conidia, it is possible to produce a larger autopolyploid nucleus using a mitotic arrester compared with the case of the original conidia. In this study, polykaryon formation was attempted using these swollen conidia. Dried mature green conidia of Trichoderma reesei QM6a (IFO 31326) were incubated in Mandel's medium in order to swell. The swollen conidia were treated with a mitotic arrester, colchicine, for autopolyploidization. After autopolyploidization, polykaryon formation was carried out using the swollen conidia. After the treatment, multiple smaller nuclei whose diameter was almost the same as that of the original strain were generated from an autopolyploid nucleus in a swollen conidium. A cellulase hyperproducer without decrease in growth rate could be selected using such swollen conidia. 
3924740	19850101	Gene	D016428 	A DEX gene conferring production of extracellular amyloglucosidase on yeast.	A DEX gene from Saccharomyces diastaticus (strain BRG536 alpha DEX1) has been cloned in the hybrid vector pJDB207. The gene is included within a 3.6-kb fragment and confers production of extracellular amylo-alpha-1,4-glucosidase (AMG) and, thereby the ability to hydrolyse starch or dextrins on Dex- strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cloned gene hybridizes to three fragments produced by ClaI digestion of DNA from BRG536; one of these (11 kb) cosegregates in crosses with DEX1, while another (10 kb) is present in all Dex+ and Dex- strains examined. Accumulation of extracellular AMG by Dex+ transformants is up to five-fold that of BRG536, and escapes regulation by the CDX1 gene under conditions of excess glucose. The enzyme produced by Dex+ transformants resembles that of BRG536 with respect to Mr (approx. 150 X 10(3)) and effects of temperature and pH. The cloned DEX gene can be used as a selectable marker for introducing recombinant plasmids into wild-type strains of S. cerevisiae.

D016428 D013485 	Parallel formation and synergism of hydrolytic enzymes and peptaibol antibiotics, molecular mechanisms involved in the antagonistic action of Trichoderma harzianum against phytopathogenic fungi.	Chitinase, beta-1,3-glucanase, and protease activities were formed when Trichoderma harzianum mycelia, grown on glucose as the sole carbon source, were transferred to fresh medium containing cell walls of Botrytis cinerea. Chitobiohydrolase, endochitinase, and beta-1,3-glucanase activities were immunologically detected in culture supernatants by Western blotting (immunoblotting), and the first two were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Under the same conditions, exogenously added [U-14C]valine was incorporated in acetone-soluble compounds with an apparent M(r) of < 2,000. These compounds comigrated with the peptaibols trichorzianines A1 and B1 in thin-layer chromatography and released [U-14C]valine after incubation in 6N HCl. Incorporation of radioactive valine into this material was stimulated by the exogenous supply of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, a rare amino acid which is a major constituent of peptaibols. The obtained culture supernatants inhibited spore germination as well as hyphal elongation of B. cinerea. Culture supernatants from mycelia placed in fresh medium without cell walls of B. cinerea did not show hydrolase activities, incorporation of [U-14C]valine into peptaibol-like compounds, and inhibition of fungal growth. Purified trichorzianines A1 and B1 as well as purified chitobiohydrolase, endochitinase, or beta-1,3-glucanase inhibited spore germination and hyphal elongation, but at concentrations higher than those observed in the culture supernatants. However, when the enzymes and the peptaibols were tested together, an antifungal synergistic interaction was observed and the 50% effective dose values obtained were in the range of those determined in the culture supernatants. Therefore, the parallel formation and synergism of hydrolytic enzymes and antibiotics may have an important role in the antagonistic action of T. harzianum against fungal phytopathogens. 
15969461	20050623	Exp._Appl._Acarol.	D016428 D013485 	In vitro and in vivo inhibition of alpha-amylases of stored-product mite Acarus siro.	The stored-product mites are the most abundant and frequent group of pests living on the stored food products in Europe. They endanger public health since they produce allergens and transmit mycotoxin-producing fungi. Novel acaricidal compounds with inhibitory effects on the digestive enzymes of arthropods are a safe alternative to the traditional neurotoxic pesticides used for control of the stored-product pests. In this work, we explored the properties of acarbose, the low molecular weight inhibitor of alpha-amylases (AI), as a novel acaricide candidate for protection of the stored products from infestation by Acarus siro (Acari: Acaridae). In vitro analysis revealed that AI blocked efficiently the enzymatic activity of digestive amylases of A. siro, and decreased the physiological capacity of mite's gut in utilizing a starch component of grain flour. In vivo experiments showed that AI suppressed the population growth of A. siro. The mites were kept for three weeks on experimental diet enriched by AI in concentration range of 0.005 to 0.25%. Population growth of A. siro was negatively correlated with the content of AI in the treated diet with a half-population dose of 0.125%. The suppressive effect of AIs on stored-product mites is discussed in the context of their potential application in GMO crops. 
18239946	20080202	J._Ind._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Effect of cultivation pH and agitation rate on growth and xylanase production by Aspergillus oryzae in spent sulphite liquor.	The effects of cultivation pH and agitation rate on growth and extracellular xylanase production by Aspergillus oryzae NRRL 3485 were investigated in bioreactor cultures using spent sulphite liquor (SSL) and oats spelts xylan as respective carbon substrates. Xylanase production by this fungus was greatly affected by the culture pH, with pH 7.5 resulting in a high extracellular xylanase activity in the SSL-based medium as well as in a complex medium with xylan as carbon substrate. This effect, therefore, was not solely due to growth inhibition at the lower pH values by the acetic acid in the SSL. The xylanase activity in the SSL medium peaked at 199 U ml(-1) at pH 7.5 with a corresponding maximum specific growth rate of 0.39 h(-1). By contrast, the maximum extracellular beta-xylosidase activity pf 0.36 U ml(-1) was recorded at pH 4.0. Three low molecular weight xylanase isozymes were secreted at all pH values within the range of pH 4-8, whereas cellulase activity on both carbon substrates was negligible. Impeller tip velocities within the range of 1.56-3.12 m s(-1) had no marked effect, either on the xylanase activity, or on the maximum volumetric rate of xylanase production. These results also demonstrated that SSL constituted a suitable carbon feedstock as well as inducer for xylanase production in aerobic submerged culture by this strain of A. oryzae. 
23306124	20130112	Bioresour._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization of three novel thermophilic xylanases from Humicola insolens Y1 with application potentials in the brewing industry.	Three xylanase genes (xynA, xynB, xynC) of glycosyl hydrolase family 10 were identified in Humicola insolens Y1. The deduced protein sequences showed the highest identity of ⩽83% to known fungal xylanases and of ⩽38% with each other. Recombinant XynA-C produced in Pichia pastoris showed optimal activities at pH 6.0-7.0 and at high temperature (70-80°C), and exhibited good stability over a broad pH range and temperatures at 60°C. The gene xynC produced by H. insolens Y1 (named XynW) was similar in enzyme properties with XynC expressed by Pichia. XynA exhibited better alkaline adaptation and thermostability, and had higher catalytic efficiency and wider substrate specificity. Under simulated mashing conditions, addition of XynA-C showed better performance on filtration acceleration (37.4%) and viscosity reduction (13.5%) than Ultraflo from Novozyme. Thus the three xylanases represent good candidates for application in the brewing industry. 
12237856	20020919	Yeast	D016428 	A cell surface display system using novel GPI-anchored proteins in Hansenula polymorpha.	A cell surface display system was developed in yeast Hansenula polymorpha. The four genes HpSED1, HpGAS1, HpTIP1and HpCWP1, encoding glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface proteins from H. polymorpha, were cloned, characterized and evaluated for their efficacies as cell surface display motifs of reporter proteins. Sequence analysis of these genes revealed that each encodes a typical GPI-anchored protein that is structurally similar to a counterpart gene in S. cerevisiae. The genes showed a high content of serine-threonine (alanine) and harboured a putative secretion signal in the N-terminus and the GPI-attachment signal in the C-terminus. The surface anchoring efficiency of these putative cell surface proteins was tested by fusion to the C-terminal of carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) from Bacillus subtilis. In all cases, high CMCase activities were detected in intact cell fraction, indicating anchoring of CMCase to the cell surface. HpCwp1p, HpGas1p and the 40 C-terminal amino acids of HpTip1p from H. polymorpha exhibited a comparatively high CMCase surface anchoring efficiency. When these proteins were used as anchoring motifs for surface display of the glucose oxidase (GOD) from Aspergillus niger, most enzyme activity was detected at the cell surface. Fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of cells displaying GOD on the cell surface demonstrated that GOD was well exposed on the cell surface. HpCwp1p showed the highest anchoring efficiency among others. 
2049872	19910101	Dev._Genet.	D016428 	Dictyostelium discoideum gene family contains a long internal amino acid repeat.	Two different cDNA clones denoted pTO270-6 and pTO270-11 represent two mRNAs that are developmentally regulated during spore germination in Dictyostelium discoideum. The respective mRNAs are found only during early germination and are not present in other stages of growth or multicellular development. Four different genomic clones that hybridize to sequences that are common to both of the 270 cDNA clones were isolated from Dictyostelium libraries and sequenced. Two are the genes for the two cDNAs, and the other two represent genes that do not seem to be transcribed. All four genomic sequences possess a very unusual internal feature in the deduced protein sequences composed of a monotonous repeat of the tetrapeptide threonine-glutamic acid-threonine-proline. The other portions of the proteins have no homology among themselves. The deduced protein corresponding to the 270-6 gene is very similar to avocado (Persea americana) cellulase. Since cellulose in the spore wall has to be digested during spore germination this suggests that this protein may function as an endo-(1,4)-beta-D-glucanase during germination. 
22752910	20120704	J._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular screening of Streptomyces isolates for antifungal activity and family 19 chitinase enzymes.	Thirty soil-isolates of Streptomyces were analyzed to determine their antagonism against plant-pathogenic fungi including Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium aristosporum, Colletotrichum gossypii, and Rhizoctonia solani. Seven isolates showed antifungal activity against one or more strain of the tested fungi. Based on the 16S rDNA sequence analysis, these isolates were identified as Streptomyces tendae (YH3), S. griseus (YH8), S. variabilis (YH21), S. endus (YH24), S. violaceusniger (YH27A), S. endus (YH27B), and S. griseus (YH27C). The identity percentages ranged from 98 to 100%. Although some isolates belonged to the same species, there were many differences in their cultural and morphological characteristics. Six isolates out of seven showed chitinase activity according to a chitinolytic activity test and on colloidal chitin agar plates. Based on the conserved regions among the family 19 chitinase genes of Streptomyces sp. two primers were used for detection of the chitinase (chiC) gene in the six isolates. A DNA fragment of 1.4 kb was observed only for the isolates YH8, YH27A, and YH27C. In conclusion, six Streptomyces strains with potential chitinolytic activity were identified from the local environment in Taif City, Saudi Arabia. Of these isolates, three belong to family 19 chitinases. To our knowledge, this is the first reported presence of a chiC gene in S. violaceusniger YH27A.

Various physical, chemical and genetic approaches have been applied in order to enhance enzyme stability and activity. In this study, the aim was to investigate the capability of sub- and supercritical carbon dioxide to alter the stability and activity of α-amylase as an alternative technique. The effects of operational parameters such as pressure (50-300 bar), temperature (28-80 °C), CO₂ flow (2-10 g min⁻¹) and time (60-180 min) were evaluated in regard to the activity and stability of fungal based α-amylase from Aspergillus oryzea. The activity of untreated enzyme was determined as 17,726 μmol/ml/min. While both sub- and supercritical conditions enhanced the activity, the increase in flow rate had an adverse effect and the activity was decreased by 28.9% at a flow rate of 10 g min⁻¹ under supercritical conditions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of untreated enzyme and treated samples exhibiting the lowest and the highest activities were almost identical except for the chemical shifts observed at the lowest activity sample from 4.0 to 4.4 ppm which were assigned to protons of hydrogen-bonded groups. Optimum conditions were determined as 240 bar, 41 °C, 4 g min⁻¹ CO₂ flow and 150 min of process duration yielding 67.7% (29,728 μmol/ml/min) higher activity than the untreated enzyme providing fundamental basis for enzymatic applications.

Correlations between a changed population of micro-organisms and the degradation of straw (author's transl)].	Fungi are of precedent importance for the decomposition of straw in comparison with bacteria and actinomycetes. Several genera and species are able to replace one another. For the fungi, by biocides easier reduced than other kinds of organisms, an inhibition of the decomposition of straw by application of fungicides is possible. An unrestricted or promoted flora of bacteria is not able to replace a restricted flora of fungi. The decomposition of straw cannot be stopped completely. Certain types of fungi locate in higher quantities as a result of the elimination of the competition by bacteria and in dependence on the used antibiotic. Then the special intensity of the decomposition of straw depends on the cellulase-activity of the in each case located fungi. In order to stop the decomposition of straw completely it is necessary to inhibit both the physiologically active bacteria (pseudomonads and bacteria) and the fungi for a longer period of time. Combinations of bactericides and fungicides can bring about synergistic decomposition retarding effects. A persistent stimulation of the straw-decomposition by application of active substances was not successful.

(Basidiomycotina).	Sistotrema brinkmannii (Bres.) J. Erikss. (Basidiomycotina, Hydanaceae), commonly regarded as a wood decay fungus, was consistently isolated from bareroot nursery Pinus banksiana Lamb. seedlings. S. brinkmannii was found in ectomycorrhizae formed by Thelephora terrestris Ehrh., Laccaria laccata (Scop.) Cooke, and Suillus luteus (L.) Roussel. In pure culture combinations with sterile P. banksiana and Populus tremuloides Michx. seedlings, S. brinkmannii colonized root cortical cells while not killing seedlings. Colonization by S. brinkmannii appeared to be intracellular but typical endo- or ectomycorrhizae were not formed. The fungus did not decay roots, although it was shown to produce cellulase in enzyme tests. Results suggest a unique association between S. brinkmannii and seedling roots that is neither mycorrhizal nor detrimental; its exact function remains to be elucidated. 
16997574	20060926	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Heterologous expression and site-directed mutagenesis studies of two Trichoderma harzianum chitinases, Chit33 and Chit42, in Escherichia coli.	Heterologous expression of two fungal chitinases, Chit33 and Chit42, from Trichoderma harzianum was tested in the different compartments and on the surface of Escherichia coli cells. Our goal was to find a fast and efficient expression system for protein engineering and directed evolution studies of the two fungal enzymes. Cytoplasmic overexpression resulted in both cases in inclusion body formation, where active enzyme could be recovered after refolding. Periplasmic expression of Chit33, and especially of Chit42, proved to be better suited for mutagenesis purposes. Recombinant chitinases from the periplasmic expression system showed activity profiles similar to those of the native proteins. Both chitinases also degraded a RET (resonance energy transfer) based bifunctionalized chitinpentaose substrate in a similar manner as reported for some putative exochitinases in the glycosyl hydrolase family 18, offering a sensitive way to assay their activities. We further demonstrated that Chit42 can also be displayed on E. coli surface and the enzymatic activity can be measured directly from the whole cells using methylumbelliferyl-chitinbioside as a substrate. The periplasmic expression and the surface display of Chit42, both offer a suitable expression system for protein engineering and activity screening in a microtiter plate scale. As a first mutagenesis approach we verified the essential role of the two carboxylic acid residues E172 (putative proton donor) and D170 (putative stabilizer) in the catalytic mechanism of Chit42, and additionally the role of the carboxylic acid E145 (putative proton donor) in the catalytic mechanism of Chit33.

Hydrolytic ability of laboratory enzyme preparations from fungus of the Penicillium genus was investigated using kraft pulp from nonbleached softwood and bleached hardwood cellulose as substrates. The enzyme preparations were shown to efficiently hydrolyze both softwood and hardwood cellulose. The yields of glucose and reducing sugars were 24-36 g/l and 27-37 g/l from 100 g/l of dry substrate in 48 h, respectively, and depended on the number of substrate grinding cycles. 
22142781	20111207	Fungal_Genet._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular characterization of the Aspergillus nidulans fbxA encoding an F-box protein involved in xylanase induction.	The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans has been used as a fungal model system to study the regulation of xylanase production. These genes are activated at transcriptional level by the master regulator the transcriptional factor XlnR and repressed by carbon catabolite repression (CCR) mediated by the wide-domain repressor CreA. Here, we screened a collection of 42 A. nidulans F-box deletion mutants grown either in xylose or xylan as the single carbon source in the presence of the glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose, aiming to identify mutants that have deregulated xylanase induction. We were able to recognize a null mutant in a gene (fbxA) that has decreased xylanase activity and reduced xlnA and xlnD mRNA accumulation. The ΔfbxA mutant interacts genetically with creAd-30, creB15, and creC27 mutants. FbxA is a novel protein containing a functional F-box domain that binds to Skp1 from the SCF-type ligase. Blastp analysis suggested that FbxA is a protein exclusive from fungi, without any apparent homologs in higher eukaryotes. Our work emphasizes the importance of the ubiquitination in the A. nidulans xylanase induction and CCR. The identification of FbxA provides another layer of complexity to xylanase induction and CCR phenomena in filamentous fungi.

D003160 D016428 D013485 	Comparative study on the rumen microbial populations, hydrolytic enzyme activities and dry matter degradability between different species of ruminant.	A comparative study among Korean native cow (Hanwoo), Holstein dairy cow, Korean native goat and crossbred sheep on the population and marker concentration of ruminal microbes, the activities of carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase), xylanase and amylase, and in situ dry matter (DM) degradability were conducted. Twelve ruminally cannulated animals, three of each species, were used. Animals were fed the same diet containing 40% formula feed and 60% rice straw at the level of 2.5% of body weight. Total viable microbial populations in the rumen fluid were significantly (P < 0.01) greater for bacteria and fungi in goat than those of Holstein. The protozoan population among ruminant species was the reverse from that of bacteria. The concentrations of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid and chitin as markers for bacteria and fungi in the rumen fluid, respectively, were highest in goat, which is in accordance with the above population data. The concentration of aminoethylphosphonic acid as marker of protozoa was highest in Hanwoo and lowest in sheep (P < 0.01). Goat had the highest (P < 0.01) activities of all the enzymes investigated among ruminants. In situ effective degradation of the DM of rice straw was approximately 19% higher in the rumen of goat compared with other animals. 
12460938	20021204	Glycobiology	D016422 D013487 	Hypoglycosylation in the alg12delta yeast mutant destabilizes protease A and causes proteolytic loss of external invertase.	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae alg12delta mutant accumulates oligosaccharide lipid with a Man(7)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide. To determine the N-glycan structures present on S. cerevisiae glycoproteins in the alg12delta strain, we made attempts to purify external invertase, a highly glycosylated secreted protein. These efforts revealed that, in the alg12delta background, external invertase was mildly hypoglycosylated and rapidly destroyed proteolytically. Although secreted alg9delta invertase was more severely hypoglycosylated than the alg12delta form, it was paradoxically stable during purification. The loss of periplasmic invertase was prevented by addition of pepstatin A to the cell cultures, suggesting that aspartyl proteases were active. We found that during overexpression of invertase in alg12delta yeast, sufficient protease A was mistargeted to the periplasmic space, where it hydrolyzed the invertase. Even though alg9delta invertase is underglycosylated in comparison to the alg12delta form, it is more stable because in this genetic background much less protease A is secreted compared to alg12delta cells. These observations may be relevant to studies using other extracellular proteins (e.g., mating factors, alpha-glucosidase) as probes when characterizing glycosylation defects in yeast.

Regulation of the synthesis of maltase and methanol-oxidizing enzymes by the carbon source has been analyzed in the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha. Maltase was shown to be responsible for the growth of H. polymorpha not only on maltose, but also on sucrose. The affinity of maltase towards maltase substrates decreased in the order: 4-nitrophenyl glucoside (PNPG) < sucrose < maltose. Mutants with glucose repression-insensitive synthesis of alcohol oxidase and maltase were obtained from H. polymorpha by mutagenesis and subsequent selection on methanol medium in the presence of 2-deoxy-D-glucose. One of the isolated mutants, L63, was studied in more detail. Mutant L63 was recessive and monogenic and it was not deficient in hexokinase. Its analysis revealed that H. polymorpha most probably has a repressor protein that in the presence of glucose can down-regulate expression of both maltase and enzymes of methanol oxidation.

Cell-free culture filtrates of the fungus Fusarium solani were examined for homogeneity with respect to beta-d-glucosidase and C(x) activities. 2. o-Nitrophenyl beta-d-glucoside and cellobiose were both used as substrates for beta-d-glucosidase activity. 3. No evidence for the non-identity of nitrophenyl beta-d-glucosidase and cellobiase activities could be found, either by heat treatment, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 or by isoelectric focusing. 4. The beta-d-glucosidase component was also a feeble exo-beta-glucanase: it had a molecular weight of approx. 400000. 5. The fall in viscosity of a solution of CM-cellulose, the formation of reducing sugars in a solution of CM-cellulose and the solubilization of phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose (Walseth cellulose), were all used for the measurement of C(x) activity. 6. The ratio of the two types of CM-cellulase activity was not changed after gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 or after chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex. 7. Three peaks of C(x) activity were obtained after electrofocusing, but all three possessed the same ratio of the two types of CM-cellulase activity as well as the same CM-cellulase/Walseth activity ratio, as the unfractionated enzyme; all three isoenzymes (isoelectric points, 4.75, 4.80-4.85 and 5.15) acted in synergism with a mixture of the C(1) and the beta-d-glucosidase components to the same extent in the solubilization of cotton fibre. 8. The molecular weight of the C(x) component was approx. 37000.

We describe the isolation of a 22.6-kilobase fragment of DNA containing the MAL1 locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results demonstrate that the MAL1 locus, like the MAL6 locus, is a complex locus containing three genes. These genes were organized similarly to their MAL6 counterparts. We refer to them as MAL11, MAL12, and MAL13 and show that they are functionally homologous to the MAL61 (encoding maltose permease), MAL62 (encoding maltase), and MAL63 (encoding the positive regulator) genes of the MAL6 locus. Transcription from each of the three genes was analyzed in a strain carrying the undisrupted MAL1 locus and in strains carrying single disruptions in each of the MAL1 genes. The MAL1 and MAL1 loci were found to be highly sequence homologous and conserved throughout the region containing these three genes. The strain used to isolate the MAL1 locus also carried the tightly linked SUC1 gene. The SUC1 gene was found to be located on the same 22.6-kilobase fragment containing the MAL1 locus and 5 kilobases from the 3' end of the MAL12 gene. The meaning of these results with regard to the mechanism of regulation of maltose fermentation is discussed. 
11391016	20010608	Protein_Eng.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Mutant barley (1-->3,1-->4)-beta-glucan endohydrolases with enhanced thermostability.	The similar three-dimensional structures of barley (1-->3)-beta-glucan endohydrolases and (1-->3,1-->4)-beta-glucan endohydrolases indicate that the enzymes are closely related in evolutionary terms. However, the (1-->3)-beta-glucanases hydrolyze polysaccharides of the type found in fungal cell walls and are members of the pathogenesis-related PR2 group of proteins, while the (1-->3,1-->4)-beta-glucanases function in plant cell wall metabolism. The (1-->3)-beta-glucanases have evolved to be significantly more stable than the (1-->3,1-->4)-beta-glucanases, probably as a consequence of the hostile environments imposed upon the plant by invading microorganisms. In attempts to define the molecular basis for the differences in stability, eight amino acid substitutions were introduced into a barley (1-->3,1-->4)-beta-glucanase using site-directed mutagenesis of a cDNA that encodes the enzyme. The amino acid substitutions chosen were based on structural comparisons of the barley (1-->3)- and (1-->3,1-->4)-beta-glucanases and of other higher plant (1-->3)-beta-glucanases. Three of the resulting mutant enzymes showed increased thermostability compared with the wild-type (1-->3,1-->4)-beta-glucanase. The largest increase in stability was observed when the histidine at position 300 was changed to a proline (mutant H300P), a mutation that was likely to decrease the entropy of the unfolded state of the enzyme. Furthermore, the three amino acid substitutions which increased the thermostability of barley (1-->3,1-->4)-beta-glucanase isoenzyme EII were all located in the COOH-terminal loop of the enzyme. Thus, this loop represents a particularly unstable region of the enzyme and could be involved in the initiation of unfolding of the (1-->3,1-->4)-beta-glucanase at elevated temperatures. 
24046254	20130919	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Genome mining for new α-amylase and glucoamylase encoding sequences and high level expression of a glucoamylase from Talaromyces stipitatus for potential raw starch hydrolysis.	Mining fungal genomes for glucoamylase and α-amylase encoding sequences led to the selection of 23 candidates, two of which (designated TSgam-2 and NFamy-2) were advanced to testing for cooked or raw starch hydrolysis. TSgam-2 is a 66-kDa glucoamylase recombinantly produced in Pichia pastoris and originally derived for Talaromyces stipitatus. When harvested in a 20-L bioreactor at high cell density (OD600 > 200), the secreted TSgam-2 enzyme activity from P. pastoris strain GS115 reached 800 U/mL. In a 6-L working volume of a 10-L fermentation, the TSgam-2 protein yield was estimated to be ∼8 g with a specific activity of 360 U/mg. In contrast, the highest activity of NFamy-2, a 70-kDa α-amylase originally derived from Neosartorya fischeri, and expressed in P. pastoris KM71 only reached 8 U/mL. Both proteins were purified and characterized in terms of pH and temperature optima, kinetic parameters, and thermostability. TSgam-2 was more thermostable than NFamy-2 with a respective half-life (t1/2) of >300 min at 55 °C and >200 min at 40 °C. The kinetic parameters for raw starch adsorption of TSgam-2 and NFamy-2 were also determined. A combination of NFamy-2 and TSgam-2 hydrolyzed cooked potato and triticale starch into glucose with yields, 71-87 %, that are competitive with commercially available α-amylases. In the hydrolysis of raw starch, the best hydrolysis condition was seen with a sequential addition of 40 U of a thermostable Bacillus globigii amylase (BgAmy)/g starch at 80 °C for 16 h, and 40 U TSgam-2/g starch at 45 °C for 24 h. The glucose released was 8.7 g/10 g of triticale starch and 7.9 g/10 g of potato starch, representing 95 and 86 % of starch degradation rate, respectively. 
3539611	19861001	Eur._J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485 	The effect of monensin on chitin synthesis in Candida albicans blastospores.	Monensin, a monovalent cation ionophore, was used to investigate some steps of the wall synthesis and morphogenesis in Candida albicans blastospores. In the presence of the drug, the pathogenic yeast developed enormous wall and septum thickenings that reacted intensely and specifically with wheat germ agglutinin and chitinase coupled to colloidal gold and fluorescein isothiocyanate. Therefore, the aberrant zones are interpreted as sites of chitin accumulation. The increased production of this homopolymer, also demonstrated by the chemical analysis of cell wall preparations, implies that monensin interferes in some way with the regulatory factors that normally control, in space and time, chitin synthetase activity.

Sugar cane bagasse consists of hemicellulose (24%) and cellulose (38%), and bioconversion of both fractions to ethanol should be considered for a viable process. We have evaluated the hydrolysis of pretreated bagasse with combinations of cellulase, beta-glucosidase, and hemicellulase. Ground bagasse was pretreated either by the AFEX process (2NH(3): 1 biomass, 100 degrees C, 30 min) or with NH(4)OH (0.5 g NH(4)OH of a 28% [v/v] per gram dry biomass; 160 degrees C, 60 min), and composition analysis showed that the glucan and xylan fractions remained largely intact. The enzyme activities of four commercial xylanase preparations and supernatants of four laboratory-grown fungi were determined and evaluated for their ability to boost xylan hydrolysis when added to cellulase and beta-glucosidase (10 filter paper units [FPU]: 20 cellobiase units [CBU]/g glucan). At 1% glucan loading, the commercial enzyme preparations (added at 10% or 50% levels of total protein in the enzyme preparations) boosted xylan and glucan hydrolysis in both pretreated bagasse samples. Xylanase addition at 10% protein level also improved hydrolysis of xylan and glucan fractions up to 10% glucan loading (28% solids loading). Significant xylanase activity in enzyme cocktails appears to be required for improving hydrolysis of both glucan and xylan fractions of ammonia pretreated sugar cane bagasse.

Streptomyces viridificans was found to be a good chitinase producer among nine species of Streptomyces screened. Minimum levels of constitutive enzyme were observed with both simple and complex carbon substrate. Arabinose doubled the enzyme production amongst the various pentoses and hexoses used with chitin. However, with glucose end-product inhibition and catabolite repression were observed. The enzyme tolerated a wide range of temperature (30-55 degrees C) and pH (3-7.5). Among various divalent cations Mn2+ and Hg2+ completely inhibited the purified enzyme while beta-mercaptoethanol stimulated its activity. Crude and purified enzyme had potential for cell wall lysis of many fungal pathogens tested.

The Trichoderma reesei xln2 gene coding for the pI9.0 endoxylanase was isolated from the wild-type strain QM6a. The gene contains one intron of 108 nucleotides and codes for a protein of 223 amino acids in which two putative N-glycosylation target sites were found. Three different T. reesei strains were transformed by targeting a construct composed of the xln2 gene, including its promoter, to the endogenous cbh1 locus. Highest overall production levels of xylanase were obtained using T. reesei ALKO2721, a genetically engineered strain, as a host. Integration into the cbh1 locus was not required for enhanced expression under control of the xln2 promoter.

Xylanases have received great attention in the development of environment-friendly technologies in the paper and pulp industry. Their use could greatly improve the overall lignocellulosic materials for the generation of liquid fuels and chemicals. Fungi are widely used as xylanase producers and are generally considered as more potent producers of xylanases than bacteria and yeasts. Large-scale production of xylanases is facilitated with the advent of genetic engineering. Recent breakthroughs in genomics have helped to overcome the problems such as limited enzyme availability, substrate scope, and operational stability. Genes encoding xylanases have been cloned in homologous and heterologous hosts with the objectives of overproducing the enzyme and altering its properties to suit commercial applications. Owing to the industrial importance of xylanases, a significant number of studies are reported on cloning and expression of the enzymes during the last few years. We, therefore, have reviewed recent knowledge regarding cloning of fungal xylanase genes into various hosts for heterologous production. This will bring an insight into the current status of cloning and expression of the fungal xylanases for industrial applications.

Penicillium decumbens is an important industrial filamentous fungus and has been widely used in biorefinery due to its high production of cellulase and hemicellulase. However, molecular engineering has still rarely been applied for strain improvement in P. decumbens. It has been proven that gene targeting manipulation in many filamentous fungi is hampered by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. To improve gene targeting efficiency in P. decumbens, the putative pku70 encoding the Ku70 homologue involved in the NHEJ pathway was identified and deleted. The Deltapku70 strain showed no apparent defect in vegetative growth, conidiation, and cellulase production, and displayed similar sensitivity to chemical agents of hygromycin B, ethyl methane sulfonate, and H2O2 at different concentrations compared with the wild-type strain. The effect of the absence of pku70 on gene targeting was tested by disruption of creA encoding a putative carbon catabolite repressor and xlnR encoding a putative transcriptional activator. Efficiency of gene targeting for both genes was 100% in the Deltapku70 strain, compared with the low efficiency in the wild-type recipient. Furthermore, the integration types for three single targeting cassettes and the cotransformation of two independent targeting cassettes were primarily investigated in P. decumbens. The highly efficient gene targeting system established in this study will open the way to large-scale functional genomic analysis in P. decumbens and contribute to the study of the mechanism of lignocellulose degradation by P. decumbens.

Calcium is a known signalling molecule in eukaryotic cells and plays a central role in the regulation of many cellular processes. In the following study, we report on the effect of external calcium treatments on the biotransformation of ginsenoside Rb1 to ginsenoside Rd by Paecilomyces bainier 229-7. We observed that the intracellular calcium content of P. bainier 229-7 mycelia was increased in response to exposure to high external Ca(2+) concentrations. Both ginsenoside Rd biotransformation and β-glucosidase activity were both found to be dependent on the external calcium concentration. At an optimal Ca(2+) concentration of 45 mM, maximal ginsenoside Rd bioconversion rate of 92.44% was observed and maximal β-glucosidase activity of 0.1778 U was reached in a 72-h biotransformation. The Ca(2+) channel blocker Verapamil blocked the trans-membrane influx of calcium and decreased ginsenoside Rd biotransformatiom. In addition, β-glucosidase activity and ginsenoside Rd content decreased by 36.0 and 29.2% respectively after a 72-h incubation in the presence of 0.05 mM Calmodulin (CaM) antagonist Perphenazine. These results suggest that both Ca(2+) channels and CaM are involved in ginsenoside Rd biotransformation via regulation of β-glucosidase activity. This is the first report regarding the effects of calcium signal transduction on biotransformation and enzyme activity in fungi. 
10905428	20000725	Curr._Genet.	D016428 D013485 	An Aspergillus oryzae CCAAT-binding protein, AoCP, is involved in the high-level expression of the Taka-amylase A gene.	Aspergillus oryzae contains a nuclear protein designated AoCP, which binds specifically to a CCAAT sequence in the promoter region of the A. oryzae Taka-amylase A gene. A gene encoding a homologue of Aspergillus nidulans HAPC, a subunit of the A. nidulans CCAAT binding complex, was isolated from A. oryzae and designated AohapC. AoHAPC comprises 215 amino acids and shows 84% identity to A. nidulans HAPC. Transformation of the A. nidulans hapC deletion strain with the AohapC gene restored the CCAAT binding activity, resulting in both enhancement of taa gene expression and complementation for the poor growth phenotype of this strain. Furthermore, introduction of the AohapC gene also restored the expression of the A. nidulans eglA gene, encoding an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, in the deletion strain. These results indicate functional interchangeability of the genes from two species.

An endo-β-1,4-xylanase gene, designated xyn10G5, was cloned from Phialophora sp. G5 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The 1,197-bp full-length gene encodes a polypeptide of 399 amino acids consisting of a putative signal peptide at residues 1-20, a family 10 glycoside hydrolase domain, a short Gly/Thr-rich linker and a family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). The deduced amino acid sequence of XYN10G5 shares the highest identity (53.4%) with a putative xylanase precursor from Aspergillus terreus NIH2624. The purified recombinant XYN10G5 exhibited the optimal activity at pH 4.0 and 70 °C, remained stable at pH 3.0-9.0 (>70% of the maximal activity), and was highly thermostable at 70 °C (retaining ~90% of the initial activity for 1 h). Substrate specificity studies have shown that XYN10G5 had the highest activity on soluble wheat arabinoxylan (350.6 U mg(-1)), and moderate activity to various heteroxylans, and low activity on different types of cellulosic substrates. Under simulated gastric conditions, XYN10G5 was stable and released more reducing sugars from soluble wheat arabinoxylan; when combined with a glucanase (CelA4), the viscosity of barley-soybean feed was significantly reduced. These favorable enzymatic properties make XYN10G5 a good candidate for application in the animal feed industry.

Strain following mutagenesis using ethidium bromide (EtBr) and microwave irradiation had resulted into a mutant P. oxalicum SAE(M)-51 having improved levels of chitin deacetylase (210.71 ± 1.65 Ul(-1)) as compared to the wild type strain (108.26 ± 1.98 Ul(-1)). Maximum enzyme production was achieved in submerged fermentation following 144 hours of incubation with notably improved productivity of 1.46 ± 0.82 Ul(-1) h(-1) as compared to the wild type strain (0.75 ± 0.53 Ul(-1)h(-1)). Scanning electron micrographs of mutant and wild type strains had revealed distinct morphological features. Evaluation of kinetic parameters viz. Q(s), Q(p), Y(p/x), Y(p/s), q(p), q(s) had denoted that strain P. oxalicum SAE(M)-51 is a hyper producer of chitin deacetylase. Glucose as compared to chitin or colloidal chitin had resulted in increased levels of enzyme production. However, replacement of glucose with chitinous substrates had prolonged the duration for enzyme production. The mutant strain had two pH optima that is 6.0 and 8.0 and had an optimum temperature of 30 °C for growth and enzyme production. 
23958135	20130821	AMB_Express	D016428 	Cellulolytic potential of thermophilic species from four fungal orders.	Elucidation of fungal biomass degradation is important for understanding the turnover of biological materials in nature and has important implications for industrial biomass conversion. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in elucidating the biological role of thermophilic fungi and in characterization of their industrially useful enzymes. In the present study we investigated the cellulolytic potential of 16 thermophilic fungi from the three ascomycete orders Sordariales, Eurotiales and Onygenales and from the zygomycete order Mucorales thus covering all fungal orders that include thermophiles. Thermophilic fungi are the only described eukaryotes that can grow at temperatures above 45°C. All 16 fungi were able to grow on crystalline cellulose but their secreted enzymes showed widely different cellulolytic activities, pH optima and thermostabilities. Interestingly, in contrast to previous reports, we found that some fungi such as Melanocarpus albomyces readily grew on crystalline cellulose and produced cellulases. These results indicate that there are large differences in the cellulolytic potential of different isolates of the same species. Furthermore, all the selected species were able to degrade cellulose but the differences in cellulolytic potential and thermostability of the secretome did not correlate to the taxonomic position. PCR amplification and sequencing of 22 cellulase genes from the fungi showed that the level of thermostability of the cellulose-degrading activity could not be inferred from the phylogenetic relationship of the cellulases.

Chitin is the second most abundant biopolymer in nature, where it protects crustaceans, parasites, fungi, and other pathogens from the adverse effects of their environments, hosts, or both. Because chitin does not exist in mammals, it had been assumed that the chitinases that degrade it are also restricted to lower life forms. However, chitinases and chitinase-like proteins have recently been noted in mice and human subjects. The prototypic chitinase, acidic mammalian chitinase, was also noted to be induced during T(H)2 inflammation through an IL-13-dependent mechanism. It was also shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of T(H)2 inflammation and IL-13 effector pathway activation and demonstrated to be expressed in an exaggerated fashion in human asthmatic tissues. The finding that chitinases contribute to host anti-parasite responses and asthmatic T(H)2 inflammation support the concept that asthma might be a parasite-independent anti-parasite response.

D016430 D016428 D016449 	Effects of a non-starch polysaccharidase enzyme preparation from Thermomyces lanuginosus on energy and protein metabolism and milk yield of dairy cattle.	Non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) form an integral part of the cell walls in plants and represent considerable available energy when degraded into absorbable mono-, di-, tri- and oligosaccharides. The ruminal microflora hydrolyses a good part of NSPs, however, recently there have been attempts to enhance the rate of utilisation by using external polysaccharidase enzymes. In the present study the effects of an enzyme preparation (Rumino-Zyme) high in xylanase activity were studied on ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, parameters of energy and protein metabolism, milk yield, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and body condition score of high-yielding dairy cows. A lignolytic enzyme preparation produced by the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus was applied in the present experiment and fed to dairy cows at 34 g/day dosage in the period between calving and the 110th day of lactation. This preparation increased VFA concentration in the rumen from about 32 days after calving and onward. Increased VFA concentration was followed by an about 5 to 10% increase in milk production and an almost 0.1% increase in butterfat production. Increased VFA concentration produced more balanced energy metabolism in the experimental cows as indicated by the lower incidence rate of hyperketonaemia, and lower acetoacetic acid and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration in the blood of the experimental cows. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity was tendentiously higher in the control group and the proportion of cows that had AST activity higher than 100 U/l was also higher in the control group. Both control and experimental cows showed balanced protein and acid-base metabolism throughout the experiment. Enhanced VFA concentration contributed to an improvement in energy balance in the experimental cows with a resultant improvement of feed intake and feed utilisation. Due to the more balanced energy metabolism postparturient body condition loss of the treated cows was reduced. 
6789615	19810101	Acta_Microbiol_Acad_Sci_Hung	D016428 	Isolation and mutation of cellulolytic fungi.	Nineteen fungi were isolated from different soil samples on the basis of clear zones formed on Rose Bengal Cellulose agar medium. In shake flasks th isolate K1 gave 12.1 units/ml of CMCase activity. A mutant of the isolate K1, KM7, was selected after N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine treatment of the wild-type. This mutant differed morphologically from the parent strain on RBCA medium and gave 36.2 units/ml of CMCase activity which represented about 50% of the enzyme yield from the standard organism, Trichoderma viride QM 9414 (80 units/ml of CMCase activity). The isolate K1, which was identified as a Phoma species, produced 48 units of beta-glucosidase. The yield of beta-glucosidase was increased about 8-fold in the mutant KM7 and was about 68% higher than the level found in T. viride QM 9414. 
20569404	20100624	Mol._Plant_Pathol.	D016428 	Isolation and characterization of genes differentially expressed during the interaction between apple fruit and Penicillium expansum.	SUMMARY Differences in gene expression during the susceptible interaction between 'Golden Delicious' apple fruits and the fungus Penicillium expansum were investigated by differential display (DD) RT-PCR. Partial cDNAs from 26 clones from both the fungus and the fruit were selected for nucleotide sequence determination and homology searches, and 20 were subsequently selected for further analyses. In a preliminary series of Northern blot analyses, 18 genes were confirmed as showing a higher expression level during the apple-fungus interaction than in control tissues. Southern analyses permitted an assignation of the fruit or fungal origin of each cDNA. Thirteen clones were derived from P. expansum and five from apple. A more detailed analysis of their expression patterns was conducted in an independent infection experiment confirming the differential expression for 12 of them. Among the differentially expressed genes were one fungal gene encoding an unknown protein and two apple genes, homologous to a beta-glucosidase and a phosphatase 2C, respectively, that were exclusively expressed during the infection process. Several up-regulated P. expansum genes seem to mediate adaptive responses to the host environment. 
11409995	20010621	J._Agric._Food_Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Experimental approach to optimize the use of alpha-Amylases in breadmaking.	alpha-Amylases from different origins (wheat, malted barley, fungi, and bacteria) are used extensively to improve breadmaking. However, the enzyme activities, in addition to the differences associated with their origins, are strongly affected by the process conditions and the presence of other compounds in the medium. The activity of different alpha-amylases was tested under different conditions (pH and temperature), and in the presence of some bread ingredients (salt and sugar), some breadmaking additives (ascorbic acid and sodium propionate), and some metabolites (organic acids and saccharides) generated during the fermentation step, to envisage the behavior of these alpha-amylases during the breadmaking process. The alpha-amylase activities were affected to a different extent by the addition of these compounds depending on the enzyme origin. In general, the alpha-amylases from cereals (wheat and malted barley) were less sensitive to the presence of some ingredients, additives, and metabolites. These results show the great variation of the alpha-amylase activity with the process conditions and the importance of its knowledge in the selection of the appropriate alpha-amylase for a specific breadmaking process.

Trichoderma viride C-1 strain was irradiated with UV until the survival level of 0.03% was obtained. Sixteen mutants were isolated on the basis of the visible clearance zone around the colonies on the media with cellulose and glycerol. Then they were cultivated on a rotary shaker in the liquid Saunders medium supplemented with microcrystalline cellulose and comminuted sugar beet pulp. Exo-1,4-beta-glucanase, endo-1,4-beta-glucanase and beta-glucosidase were assayed in the supernatants of postcultural liquids at different time intervals of culture. The same mutants were characterized by higher biosynthesis level of exoglucanase (1.2-5.0 times) endoglucanase (1.2-2.5 times) and beta-glucosidase (1.5-1.7 times) when compared with the wild type strain.

Like other fungi, Botrytis cinera produces an exocellular beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucanase. This constitutive enzyme is produced only when Botrytis is cultivated in a glucose depleted medium. The enzyme is precipitated by ammonium sulfate from 20 to 80% saturation. Maximum activity is at pH between 5 and 6 and temperature between 40 and 50 degrees C; stability is good up to 30 degrees C. This enzyme cannot be applied to the treatment of wines containing Botrytis glucan. 
17154477	20061213	Biomacromolecules	D016428 D013485 	Substituent distribution and clouding behavior of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose analyzed using enzymatic degradation.	The distribution of substituents along the polymer backbone will have a strong influence on the properties of modified cellulose. Endoglucanases were used to degrade three different batches of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) derivatives with similar chemical properties. The phase separation of the HPMCs as a function of temperature, i.e., the clouding behavior, was analyzed prior to degradation. The total amount of unsubstituted glucose was determined using total acid hydrolysis followed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). The products after enzymatic degradation were analyzed with size-exclusion chromatography with online multiangle light scattering and refractive index detection and also with reducing end determination. To further characterize the formed products, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was employed for analysis of short-chained oligosaccharides. The different endoglucanases showed varying degradation capability of HPMC derivatives, depending on structure of the active site. The investigated HPMCs had different susceptibility to degradation by the endoglucanases. The results showed a difference in substituent distribution between HPMC batches, which could explain the differing clouding behaviors. The batch with the lowest cloud point was shown to contain a higher number of non-degradable, highly substituted regions. 
23530973	20130328	J._Agric._Food_Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Analysis of phenolic compounds in Portuguese wild and commercial berries after multienzyme hydrolysis.	Berry fruits are a good source of phenolic compounds and thus, potentially beneficial to health. Phenolic compounds are mainly present as a variety of conjugated forms, either with sugars via O-glycosidic bonds or with other polyols as esters. This chemodiversity makes characterization and identification highly demanding. Selected varieties of commercial blueberries, raspberries and blackberries and the two wild berries Portuguese crowberry and strawberry tree fruits were characterized for individual phenolic content by liquid chromatography-diode array detection and mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) after hydrolysis by a novel combination of the fungal glycosidases hesperidinase and cellulase. This approach is shown to be a simple alternative to other existing methods for analysis of plant phenolic compound aglycones. The hydrolysis of glycosides and organic acid esters is efficient and less aggressive than acid and alkaline hydrolysis. This method is able to disclose new sources of dietary phenolic compounds, and the potential usefulness of Portuguese crowberry and strawberry tree fruit is herein demonstrated.

A protocol for isolating and regenerating protoplasts from Trichothecium roseum has been described. Protoplasts from T. roseum were isolated using (i) a lytic enzyme combination composed of Novozym 234, chitinase, cellulase, and pectinase at a 5-mg/mL concentration and (ii) 0.6 M KCl as an osmotic stabilizer. A maximum number of 28 x 10(4) protoplasts/mL were obtained at pH 5.5. Experiments on the regeneration and reversion of protoplasts revealed a maximum regeneration (60.8%) in complete medium (potato dextrose--yeast extract agar) amended with 0.6 M KCl. The regenerated protoplasts were similar to the original parent strain in morphology, pigmentation, growth, and sporulation.

Piromyces sp. strain E2, an anaerobic fungus isolated from an Indian elephant (hindgut fermenter) was tested for its ability to ferment a range of substrates. The fungus was able to use bagasse, cellobiose, cellulose, fructose, glucose, lactose, mannose, starch, wheat bran, wheat straw, xylan and xylose. Formate and acetate were the main fermentation products after growth on these substrates. The amount of carbon found in the fermentation products of cultures, in which substrate digestion was complete averaged 88.5 mM, or 59% of the carbon offered as substrate. No growth was observed on other substrates tested. Lactose, starch, cellobiose and filter paper cellulose were good inducers of cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes. Cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes were produced constitutively by Piromyces strain E2, although enzyme activities were generally lower after growth on glucose and other soluble sugars. Complex substrates (bagasse, wheat bran, and wheat straw) were good inducers for xylanolytic enzymes but not for cellulolytic enzymes. The extracellular protein banding pattern after SDS-PAGE was therefore only slightly affected by the growth substrate. Identical beta-glucosidase and endoglucanase activity patterns were found after growth on different substrates. This indicated that differences in enzyme activities were not the result of secretion of different sets of isoenzymes although it remains possible that the relative amount of each isoenzyme produced is influenced by the growth substrate.

This dough supplementation caused better crumb porosity and higher moisture in bread and finally the shelf life is extended. No increase of total acidity was resulted from the enzyme addition. The experimental results have confirmed the applicability of this xylanase in bakery.

Recent progress and improvement in "-omics" technologies has made it possible to study the physiology of organisms by integrated and genome-wide approaches. This bears the advantage that the global response, rather than isolated pathways and circuits within an organism, can be investigated ("systems biology"). The sequencing of the genome of Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jecorina), a fungus that serves as a major producer of biomass-degrading enzymes for the use of renewable lignocellulosic material towards production of biofuels and biorefineries, has offered the possibility to study this organism and its enzyme production on a genome wide scale. In this review, I will highlight the use of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics towards an improved and novel understanding of the biochemical processes that involve in the massive overproduction of secreted proteins. 
20221730	20100312	J._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and biochemical properties of a glucose-stimulated beta-D-glucosidase produced by Humicola grisea var. thermoidea grown on sugarcane bagasse.	The effect of several carbon sources on the production of mycelial-bound beta-glucosidase by Humicola grisea var. thermoidea in submerged fermentation was investigated. Maximum production occurred when cellulose was present in the culture medium, but higher specific activities were achieved with cellobiose or sugarcane bagasse. Xylose or glucose (1%) in the reaction medium stimulated beta-glucosidase activity by about 2-fold in crude extracts from mycelia grown in sugarcane bagasse. The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography, showing a single band in PAGE and SDS-PAGE. The beta-glucosidase had a carbohydrate content of 43% and showed apparent molecular masses of 57 and 60 kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature were 6.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The purified enzyme was thermostable up to 60 min in water at 55 degrees C and showed half-lives of 7 and 14 min when incubated in the absence or presence of 50 mM glucose, respectively, at 60 degrees C. The enzyme hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-fucopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, lactose, and cellobiose. The best synthetic and natural substrates were p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-fucopyranoside and cellobiose, respectively. Purified enzyme activity was stimulated up to 2-fold by glucose or xylose at concentrations from 25 to 200 mM. The addition of purified or crude beta-glucosidase to a reaction medium containing Trichoderma reesei cellulases increased the saccharification of sugarcane bagasse by about 50%. These findings suggest that H. grisea var. thermoidea beta-glucosidase has a potential for biotechnological applications in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials. 
15032844	20040323	Physiol_Plant	D016428 	Effects of Rhizoctonia infection and drought on peroxidase and chitinase activity in Norway spruce (Picea abies).	Seedlings of Norway spruce were exposed to fungal infection and drought in order to investigate differences in their stress responses on the enzymatic level. Six-week-old seedlings were infected with the root rot fungus Rhizoctonia, or subjected to drought, respectively. Changes at the enzymatic level were more rapid and significantly higher in infected plants in comparison with drought-stressed spruce plants. Rhizoctonia infection resulted in early local and systemic increase in peroxidase and chitinase activity. The most prominent isoforms responding were highly basic peroxidases and chitinases (pI 9-9.5) and several acidic chitinases (pI3-4). An increased intensity of similar peroxidase isoforms was found in drought-affected plants. Two peroxidase isoforms (with pI < 9) accumulated exclusively in response to drought. These results suggest that at an early stage of infection and drought stress, the two stresses can be distinguished by the temporal appearance and isoform profile of peroxidases and chitinases. Changes in enzyme activity appeared before changes in physiological parameters, thus these isoform profiles could be used as early markers of stress conditions in spruce.

Repeated cultivation of the selected cultures on the Minoda agar medium led to a 200% increase in the enzyme activity in the submerged culture. Addition of sodium nitrate to the Minoda medium during submerged cultivation allowed a 3-fold increase of the synthesis of acid stable alpha-amylase.

Naringinases has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years due to its hydrolytic activities which include the production of rhamnose, and prunin and debittering of citrus fruit juices. While this enzyme is widely distributed in fungi, its production from bacterial sources is less commonly known. Fungal naringinase are very important as they are used industrially in large amounts and have been extensively studied during the past decade. In this article, production of bacterial naringinase and potential biotechnological applications are discussed. Bacterial rhamnosidases are exotype enzymes that hydrolyse terminal non-reducing α-L-rhamnosyl groups from α-L-rhamnose containing polysaccharides and glycosides. Structurally, they are classified into family 78 of glycoside hydrolases and characterized by the presence of Asp567 and Glu841 in their active site. Optimization of fermentation conditions and enzyme engineering will allow the development of improved rhamnosidases for advancing suggested industrial applications. 
16666809	19890601	Plant_Physiol.	D016428 	A beta-Galactosidase from Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) Seeds.	A basic beta-galactosidase (beta-Galase) has been purified 281-fold from imbibed radish (Raphanus sativus L.) seeds by conventional purification procedures. The purified enzyme is an electrophoretically homogeneous protein consisting of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kilodaltons and pl values of 8.6 to 8.8. The enzyme was maximally active at pH 4.0 on p-nitrophenyl beta-d-galactoside and beta-1,3-linked galactobiose. The enzyme activity was inhibited strongly by Hg(2+) and 4-chloromercuribenzoate. d-Galactono-(1-->4)-lactone and d-galactal acted as potent competitive inhibitors. Using galactooligosaccharides differing in the types of linkage as the substrates, it was demonstrated that radish seed beta-Galase specifically split off beta-1,3- and beta-1,6-linked d-galactosyl residues from the nonreducing ends, and their rates of hydrolysis increased with increasing chain lengths. Radish seed and leaf arabino-3,6-galactan-proteins were resistant to the beta-galase alone but could be partially degraded by the enzyme after the treatment with a fungal alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase leaving some oligosaccharides consisting of d-galactose, uronic acid, l-arabinose, and other minor sugar components besides d-galactose as the main product.

The enzymatic degradation of single crystals of mannan I with the catalytic core domain of a beta-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78 or Man5A) from Trichoderma reesei was investigated by transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The enzyme attack took place at the edge of the crystals and progressed towards their centres. Quite remarkably the crystalline integrity of the crystals was preserved almost to the end of the digestion process. This behaviour is consistent with an endo-mechanism, where the enzyme interacts with the accessible mannan chains located at the crystal periphery and cleaves one mannan molecule at a time. The endo mode of digestion of the crystals was confirmed by an analysis of the soluble degradation products.

D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of pathogenesis-related protein 4 from jelly fig (Ficus awkeotsang Makino) achenes associated with ribonuclease, chitinase and anti-fungal activities.	A cDNA fragment (FaPR4) encoding a class I pathogenesis-related protein 4 (PR-4) from Ficus awkeotsang was obtained by PCR cloning. Plant PR-4s were grouped into class I and II, differing by the presence of ChtBD and hinge. The predicted mature FaPR4 comprises N-terminal chitin-binding domain (ChtBD), hinge, Barwin domain and C-terminal extension. FaPR4-C, an N-terminal truncated form of FaPR4, was designed to mimic the structural feature of class II PR-4s. FaPR4 and FaPR4-C were over-expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris, and both recombinants exhibited RNase and anti-fungal activities. To our knowledge, it is the first report that FaPR4, a member of class I PR-4s has RNase activity as class II. FaPR4 possesses better anti-fungal activities toward Fusarium oxysporum and Sclerotium rolfsii than FaPR4-C. Heat-treated FaPR4 remained RNase and anti-fungal activities; while heat-treated FaPR4-C lost those activities. Therefore, ChtBD of FaPR4 may not only contribute to its anti-fungal but also improve the thermal stability of protein. It also implied the correlation of RNase activity with anti-fungal activity of FaPR4-C. Furthermore, FaPR4 was detected to have weak but significant chitinase activity, and its chitinase activity was reduced after heat treatment. The chitinase activity by FaPR4-C was much lower than FaPR4.

(Amphibian, anuran) with conventional techniques for light microscopy].	Histochemical stains with and without enzymatic digestions such as alpha-amylase, neuraminidase and hyaluronidase, made possible to localize and differentiate various types of glycoconjugates (GCs) in the tongue of the toad Bufo marinus. In the dorsal mucosae the covering epithelium of the filiform papillae, of the central folds and in the marginal cells of the fungiform papillae there were present large amounts of neutral GCs with little or no galactose and/or N-acetylgalactosamine and scanty carboxylic acid GCs while the superficial strata of the taste organs showed a mixture of neutral an acid GCs with a predominance of sulfated and carboxylic acid GCs. The glandular secretory cells showed neutral GCs almost exclusively with a gradient of concentrations increasing from the base to the apex being galactose or N-acetyl-galactosamine one of the component sugars. The ventral epithelium showed two types of mucous cells, one with neutral GCs and the other with neutral and acidic GCs. The connective tissue contained many mast cells showing highly acid GCs both sulfated and carboxylic with some neutral GCs. The extracellular connective matrix showed scanty neutral and acid GCs. Glycogen was present in the cytoplasm of glandular epithelial cells and of the striated muscle fibers. Additionally, the obtained results suggest the presence of a type of GC with a carboxylic acid (sialic acid) resistant to neuraminidase of Clostridium perfringens used in this study.

The four possible monodeoxy derivatives of p-nitrophenyl (PNP) alpha-D-galactopyranoside were synthesized, and hydrolytic activities of the alpha-galactosidase of green coffee bean, Mortierella vinacea and Aspergillus niger against them were elucidated. The 2- and 6-deoxy substrates were hydrolyzed by the enzymes from green coffee bean and M. vinacea, while they scarcely acted on the 3- and 4-deoxy compounds. On the other hand, A. niger alpha-galactosidase hydrolyzed only the 2-deoxy compound in these deoxy substrates, and the activity was very high. These results indicate that the presence of two hydroxyl groups (OH-3 and -4) is essential for the compounds to act as substrates for the enzymes of green coffee bean and M. vinacea, while the three hydroxyl groups (OH-3, -4, and -6) are necessary for the activity of the A. niger enzyme. The kinetic parameters (K(m) and Vmax) of the enzymes for the hydrolysis of PNP alpha-D-galactopyranoside and its deoxy derivatives were obtained from kinetic studies.

The kidney has been identified as the specific target organ for in vivo exposure to an agricultural fungicide, N-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)succinimide (NDPS). The goal of this study was to determine if urinary protein and enzyme excretion were sensitive, non-invasive markers for NDPS-induced renal damage. The proximal tubular enzymes that were monitored were the brush-border enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). Male Fischer 344 (F344) rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.2 or 1.0 mmol kg-1 NDPS. Control animals were injected i.p. with sesame oil (2.5 ml kg-1). Urine was collected on ice 0-3, 3-6 and 6-24 h after NDPS or vehicle injection. Urinary protein and urinary NAG excretion levels were elevated (P < 0.05) above the control levels 0-3 h after treatment with 0.2 mmol kg-1 NDPS. Urinary protein and enzyme excretion was comparable between 0.2 mmol kg-1 NDPS-treated and control groups for all other time periods. Administration of a marked nephrotoxicant dose (1.0 mmol kg-1) was associated with elevated levels of urinary protein, NAG and ALP beginning 0-3 h after treatment when compared to the control group or to respective baseline values. It was concluded from these studies that measurement of urinary protein as well as the release of ALP and NAG were sensitive markers of renal damage produced by NDPS.

D016428 	Purification and characterization of a novel exo-beta-1,3-1,6-glucanase from the fruiting body of the edible mushroom Enoki (Flammulina velutipes).	To elucidate the role of beta-glucanases in the cell-wall degradation involved in morphogenesis, an exo-beta-1,3-1,6-glucanase (FvBGL1) was purified from fruiting bodies of the edible mushroom Enoki (Flammulina velutipes), and its enzymatic properties were studied. At least three beta-glucanases were detected in the crude extract by zymogram assay when 1% laminarin was used as substrate. The molecular mass of FvBGL1 was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 80 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature for the action of FvBGL1 were 6.1 and 60 degrees C respectively. FvBGL1 was completely inactivated by 1 mM mercuric ions. FvBGL1 hydrolyzed F. velutipes cell-wall beta-glucan as well as beta-1,3- and beta-1,6-glucans from various sources with glucose as the only reaction product. Transglucosylation was observed when the enzyme acted on laminarinonaose. FvBGL1 can be assumed to degrade F. velutipes cell-wall beta-1,3-glucan, but most probably acts more efficiently in concert with other endogenous beta-glucan degrading enzymes. 
23036858	20121006	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	Bacterial and plant ketol-acid reductoisomerases have different mechanisms of induced fit during the catalytic cycle.	Ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is the second enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway, which is found in plants, fungi and bacteria but not in animals. This difference in metabolism between animals and microorganisms makes KARI an attractive target for the development of antimicrobial agents. Herein we report the crystal structure of Escherichia coli KARI in complex with Mg(2+) and NADPH at 2.3Å resolution. Ultracentrifugation studies confirm that the enzyme exists as a tetramer in solution, and isothermal titration calorimetry shows that the binding of Mg(2+) increases structural disorder while the binding of NADPH increases the structural rigidity of the enzyme. Comparison of the structure of the E. coli KARI-Mg(2+)-NADPH complex with that of enzyme in the absence of cofactors shows that the binding of Mg(2+) and NADPH opens the interface between the N- and C-domains, thereby allowing access for the substrates to bind: the existence of only a small opening between the domains in the crystal structure of the unliganded enzyme signifies restricted access to the active site. This observation contrasts with that in the plant enzyme, where the N-domain can rotate freely with respect to the C-domain until the binding of Mg(2+) and/or NADPH stabilizes the relative positions of these domains. Support is thereby provided for the idea that plant and bacterial KARIs have evolved different mechanisms of induced fit to prepare the active site for catalysis. 
18842142	20081010	BMC_Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Sulphur metabolism and cellulase gene expression are connected processes in the filamentous fungus Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei).	Sulphur compounds like cysteine, methionine and S-adenosylmethionine are essential for the viability of most cells. Thus many organisms have developed a complex regulatory circuit that governs the expression of enzymes involved in sulphur assimilation and metabolism. In the filamentous fungus Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) little is known about the participants in this circuit. Analyses of proteins binding to the cellulase activating element (CAE) within the promotor of the cellobiohydrolase cbh2 gene led to the identification of a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase protein named LIMPET (LIM1), which is an orthologue of the sulphur regulators SCON-2 of Neurospora crassa and Met30p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription of lim1 is specifically up-regulated upon sulphur limitation and responds to cellulase inducing conditions. In addition, light dependent stimulation/shut down of cellulase gene transcription by methionine in the presence of sulphate was observed. Further, lim1 transcriptionally reacts to a switch from constant darkness to constant light and is subject to regulation by the light regulatory protein ENVOY. Thus lim1, despite its function in sulphur metabolite repression, responds both to light as well as sulphur- and carbon source. Upon growth on cellulose, the uptake of sulphate is dependent on the light status and essential for growth in light. Unlike other fungi, growth of H. jecorina is not inhibited by selenate under low sulphur conditions, suggesting altered regulation of sulphur metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis of the five sulphate permeases found in the genome of H. jecorina revealed that the predominantly mycelial sulphate permease is lacking, thus supporting this hypothesis. Our data indicate that the significance of the sulphate/methionine-related signal with respect to cellulase gene expression is dependent on the light status and reaches beyond detection of sulphur availability.

D016428 	Hydrolysis of oligosaccharides of the β-(1→4)-linked D-xylose series by an endo(1→4)-β-D-xylanase from the anaerobic rumen fungus Neocallimastix frontalis.	An endo-(1→4)-β-D-xylanase from Neocallimastix frontalis was purified by anion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa on SDS-PAGE and exhibited maximum activity at 50°C and at pH values between 6.0 and 6.6. Kinetic studies on the hydrolysis of xylo-oligosaccharides, ranging from xylobiose to xylodecaose, showed that xylohexaose and xyloheptaose were the preferred substrates for the enzyme and that xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetraose were not hydrolysed. Xylose was not a product of the hydrolysis of any of the xylo-oligosaccharide substrates tested. The enzyme appeared to have a strong preference for the hydrolysis of the internal glycosidic bonds of the oligosaccharides, which is typical of endo-(1→4)-β-D-xylanase activity, but it differed from other fungal endo-(1→4)-β-D-xylanases in that it had uniform action on the various internal linkages in the xylo-oligosaccharides.  
16342535	20051214	Environ_Technol	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Influence of bulking agents and microbial activator on thermophilic aerobic transformation of sewage sludge.	Bangkok, while improving the wastewater treatment in order to alleviate the river pollution, faces important amounts of sewage sludge. The sewage sludge contains organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus available for plant growth. However, it may contain pathogenic microorganisms. To be used for agricultural purposes, these pathogens should be destroyed, which can be achieved with the thermophilic phase of composting. As the sewage sludge is dense and unable to compost alone (low C/N ratio), it should be mixed with an organic by-product. Two by-products available in large quantities in Thailand (wood chips and rice husk) have been tested for mixture with sewage sludge. As these products are not easy to decompose (presence of silica in rice husk and lignin/tannins in wood chips), the addition of a microbial activator for composting has been tested in controlled conditions (small quantities of organic mixtures, 55 degrees C, moisture maintained at 60-70% of water holding capacity). The monitoring of the decomposition has been made by measuring the carbon dioxide respiration, pH, organic matter and nitrogen contents and the evolution of enzymatic activities. When mixed with sewage sludge, wood chips and rice husk do not show significant differences concerning decomposition after 63 days. The use of an activator within the experimental conditions does not improve the decomposition of organic matter contained in the mixture of sewage sludge and rice husk or wood chips. 
6310400	19830322	Mycopathologia	D003160 D016428 	Contribution to the study of the enzymatic profiles of yeast organisms with medical interest.	The enzymatic profiles of several yeastlike organisms were studied using 19 substrates included in the API ZYM system. The isolates evaluated were: 186 Candida albicans, 19 C. stellatoidea, 4 C. tropicalis, 2 C. parapsilosis, 2 C. pseudotropicalis, 1 C. guilliermondii, 3 C. krusei, 11 Torulopsis (Candida) glabrata, 1 Cryptococcus neoformans, 2 Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, 1 Rhodotorula rubra, and 1 R. mucilaginosa. Esterase lipase (C8), leucine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, and phosphoamidase were detected in all of the isolates while trypsin and alpha-galactosidase were not found in any of the isolates using this system. The other enzymes were produced to a variable degree. The different enzymatic profiles might prove useful in the rapid differential diagnosis of genera and species of these yeastlike organisms. To this end, more extensive studies using more isolates of each species will be required, and enzymatic activity should be verified with other techniques and substrates. 
9390436	19971209	Plant_Physiol.	D016428 D013485 	Differential expression of chitinases in Vitis vinifera L. responding to systemic acquired resistance activators or fungal challenge.	The concept of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) enables a novel approach to crop protection, and particular pathogenesis-related proteins, i.e. an acidic chitinase, have been classified as markers of the SAR response. Basic class I (VCHIT1b) and a class III (VCH3) chitinase cDNAs were cloned from cultured Vitis vinifera L. cv Pinot Noir cells and used to probe the induction response of grapevine cells to salicylic acid or yeast elicitor. Furthermore, the cells were treated with the commercial SAR activators 2,6-dichloroiso-nicotinic acid or benzo(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester. Elicitor or salicylic acid induced both VCHIT1b and VCH3 transcript abundances, whereas 2,6-dichloroiso-nicotinic acid or benzo(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester enhanced exclusively the expression of VCH3. To assess the systemic sensation of chitinase expression, single leaves of Vitis vinifera L. cv Pinot Noir or Vitis rupestris plants were inoculated with Plasmopara viticola spore suspensions, and the VCH3 and VCHIT1b mRNA amounts in the infected versus the adjacent, healthy leaf were monitored. Two VCH3 mRNA maxima were observed 2 and 6 d postinoculation in the infected, susceptible V. vinifera tissue, whereas in the healthy leaf the transcript increased from low levels d 2 postinoculation to prominent levels d 6 to 8 postinoculation. The level of VCH3 mRNA increased also over 4 d in the inoculated, resistant V. rupestris tissue. However, necrotic spots rapidly limited the infection, and the VCH3 transcript was undetectable in the upper-stage, healthy leaf. The expression of VCHIT1b remained negligible under either experimental condition. Overall, the results suggest that the selective expression of VCH3 might be a reliable indicator of the SAR response in V. vinifera L. 
21790816	20110728	Plant_J.	D016428 D013485 	Chitinase III in pomegranate seeds (Punica granatum Linn.): a high-capacity calcium-binding protein in amyloplasts.	Chitinases are a class of ubiquitous proteins that are widely distributed in plants. Defense is the major natural role for chitinases, primarily against fungal pathogens. Little is known regarding their non-defensive roles in seeds. In this study, a new class III chitinase from pomegranate seeds (pomegranate seed chitinase, PSC) was isolated and purified to homogeneity. The native state of PSC is a monomer with a molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa. This chitinase naturally binds calcium ions with high capacity and low affinity, suggesting that PSC is a calcium storage protein. Consistent with this idea, its amino acid sequence (inferred from cDNA) is rich in acidic amino acid residues, especially Asp, similar to reported calcium storage proteins. The presence of calcium considerably improves the stability of the protein but has little effect on its enzymatic activity. Transmission electron microscopy analyses indicate that, similar to phytoferritin, this enzyme is widely distributed in the stroma of amyloplasts of the embryonic cells, suggesting that amyloplasts in seeds could serve as an alternative plastid for calcium storage. Indeed, the transmission electron microscopy results showed that, within the embryonic cells, calcium ions are mainly distributed in the stroma of the amyloplasts, consistent with a role for PSC in calcium storage. Thus, the plant appears to have evolved a new plastid for calcium storage in seeds. During seed germination, the content of this enzyme decreases with time, suggesting that it is involved in the germination process.

The cellulolytic enzyme beta-1,4-glucan cellobiohydrolase (CBH) has been isolated from the crude mixture of cellulase enzymes of Trichoderma viride by gel filtration and ion-exchange methods, and some aspects of its kinetic behaviour have been examined. Studies of the initial rates of the CBH-catalyzed production of cellobiose from fibrous alpha-cellulose show that (i) the dissociation constant for cellobiose competitive product inhibition of the reaction is Ki = (1.13 +/- 0.37) X 10(-3) M, (ii) the adsorption of CBH on fibrous alpha-cellulose and its subsequent reaction conform to kinetic equations developed in conjunction with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, (iii) the rate-pH curve has a maximum at pH 5.2 and decreases at higher and lower pH values, exhibiting enzyme pK values of 3.8 and 6.5, and (iv) the energy of activation of the overall reaction between 5 and 60 degrees C is 5.3 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1 at pH 5.2. Studies of the time course of the reaction over extended periods of time up to 40% hydrolysis of the cellulose show that (v) the data fit better to a competitive product inhibition model than to models of anticompetitive product inhibition or noncompetitive product inhibition.

Complete mannanase gene with two introns was cloned from Trichoderrna reesei by PCR. The two introns were then removed by overlap extension PCR. The gene encoding the mature mannanase protein was inserted into the expression vector pPIC9K, downstream of a alpha-factor signal peptide sequence. The resultant recombinant vector was named pM242. After linearized with Sac I , pM242 was transformed to Pichia pastoris GS115 by electroporation. After screening, the recombinant strain Gpmf25 that expresses the secretory protein at high level was obtained. The activity of the recombinant mannanase reached 12.5 IU/mL. Optimum pH and temperature for the recombinant enzyme were 5.0 and 80 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was stable at pH 5.0-6.0 and maintained over 50% of original activity after incubation at 70 degrees C for 30 min. 
523359	19790901	Postgrad_Med_J	D016428 	The influence of carbohydrases on the growth of fungal pathogens in vitro and in vivo.	Mixtures of mycolytic enzymes from various sources release protoplasts from living fungal tissue under suitable conditions. Such enzyme mixtures obtained from Coprinus comatus (mycolase I), Physarum polycephalum (mycolase II) and Lycoperdon pyriforme (mycolase III) are of low toxicity in mammals when given parenterally and are able to cure experimental systemic fungal infections in mice when administered alone or in conjunction with normally ineffective levels of conventional antimycotic drugs such as amphotericin B. The effect is believed to be due to enzymic degradation of the fungal cell wall either killing the fungus directly or enhancing activity of existing antifungal agents by increasing access to the cell interior.

Polymorphisms of a major developmentally regulated prespore-specific protein (PsA) in Dictyostelium discoideum slugs are described. These polymorphisms allowed discrimination between PsA (found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix) and a similar extracellular but nonpolymorphic protein, ShA. The two proteins were also distinguished by their differing reactivities with a range of monoclonal antibodies and by their sensitivity to release from the sheath with cellulase. The results are discussed in terms of the molecular and genetic relationships between the cell surface and the extracellular matrix during development. 
14741374	20040127	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Evidence that cleavage of the precursor enzyme by autocatalysis caused secretion of multiple amylases by Aspergillus niger.	The observation that a mutant strain of Aspergillus niger isolated for protease overproduction accumulated Taka-amylase supported an earlier report that processing of the precursor amylase by protease resulted in the secretion of multiple amylases. Studies using a mutant strain revealed that such processing was not due to aspergillopepsin but to autocatalysis by an inherent protease activity of the precursor and glucoamylase. Alignment of protease sequences with glucoamylase showed regions of consensus with serine carboxypeptidase of A. niger. Thus point mutations in this region due to ultraviolet radiation apparently caused the mutant to evolve with enhanced protease activity that degraded the precursor and accumulated Taka-amylase.

The fermented manure derivative known as Preparation 500 is traditionally used as a field spray in biodynamic agriculture for maintaining and increasing soil fertility. This work aimed at characterizing the product from a microbiological standpoint and at assaying its bioactive properties. The approach involved molecular taxonomical characterization of the culturable microbial community; ARISA fingerprints of the total bacteria and fungal communities; chemical elemental macronutrient analysis via a combustion analyzer; activity assays for six key enzymes; bioassays for bacterial quorum sensing and chitolipooligosaccharide production; and plant hormonelike activity. The material was found to harbor a bacterial community of 2.38 × 10(8) CFU/g dw dominated by Grampositives with minor instances of Actinobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. ARISA showed a coherence of bacterial assemblages in different preparation lots of the same year in spite of geographic origin. Enzymatic activities showed elevated values of beta-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, chitinase, and esterase. The preparation had no quorum sensing-detectable signal, and no rhizobial nod gene-inducing properties, but displayed a strong auxin-like effect on plants. Enzymatic analyses indicated a bioactive potential in the fertility and nutrient cycling contexts. The IAA activity and microbial degradation products qualify for a possible activity as soil biostimulants. Quantitative details and possible modes of action are discussed. 
11754346	20020105	Biopolymers	D016428 D013485 	Enzymatic degradation of carboxymethyl cellulose hydrolyzed by the endoglucanases Cel5A, Cel7B, and Cel45A from Humicola insolens and Cel7B, Cel12A and Cel45Acore from Trichoderma reesei.	Enzymatic hydrolysis of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) has been studied with purified endoglucanases Hi Cel5A (EG II), Hi Cel7B (EG I), and Hi Cel45A (EG V) from Humicola insolens, and Tr Cel7B (EG I), Tr Cel12A (EG III), and Tr Cel45Acore (EG V) from Trichoderma reesei. The CMC, with a degree of substitution (DS) of 0.7, was hydrolyzed with a single enzyme until no further hydrolysis was observed. The hydrolysates were analyzed for production of substituted and non-substituted oligosaccharides with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Production of reducing ends and of nonsubstituted oligosaccharides was determined as well. The two most effective endoglucanases for CMC hydrolysis were Hi Cel5A and Tr Cel7B. These enzymes degraded CMC to lower molar mass fragments compared with the other endoglucanases. The products had the highest DS determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. Thus, Hi Cel5A and Tr Cel7B were less inhibited by the substituents than the other endoglucanases. The endoglucanase with clearly the lowest activity on CMC was Tr Cel45Acore. It produced less than half of the amount of reducing ends compared to Tr Cel7B; furthermore, the products had significantly lower DS. By MALDI-TOF-MS, oligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization (DP) and with different number of substituents could be separated and identified. The average oligosaccharide DS as function of DP could be measured for each enzyme after hydrolysis. The combination of techniques for analysis of product formation gave information on average length of unsubstituted blocks of CMC.

D016428 	Functional analysis of Botrytis cinerea pectin methylesterase genes by PCR-based targeted mutagenesis: Bcpme1 and Bcpme2 are dispensable for virulence of strain B05.10.	SUMMARY Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic pathogen that produces an array of enzymes capable of attacking the plant cell wall components. We have previously shown that growth of the fungus in planta is accompanied by the degradation of pectin and that endopolygalacturonase (Bcpg) genes are expressed during infection of different plant tissues. It was assumed that pectin demethylation by pectin methylesterases (PME) was essential for the subsequent depolymerization by BcPGs to occur efficiently. We report here on the functional analysis of two Bcpme genes in strain B05.10, using a gene-replacement approach. The method used for the generation of constructs for gene replacement in B. cinerea circumvents the need for cloning and yielded a high proportion of homologous recombinants. Mutants lacking both Bcpme genes are not affected in their growth on highly methylated pectin, nor did they show any reduction in virulence. The results suggest that B. cinerea strain B05.10 can efficiently degrade pectin without prior demethylation. 
23871048	20130723	Food_Chem	D016428 D013485 	High-yield production of a low-temperature-active polygalacturonase for papaya juice clarification.	A novel endo-polygalacturonase (endo-PG I) from Achaetomium sp. Xz8 was identified, overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and characterized in this report. Recombinant endo-PG I is distinguished from other enzyme counterparts by its high activity towards polygalacturonic acid (49,934 U/ml) and high yield in the 15-l fermentor (2.13 g/l). It exhibits optimal activity at 45 °C and remained active over a broad temperature range of 0-80 °C. Distinct from most fungal polygalacturonases that have acidic pH optima, endo-PG I is optimally active at pH 6, similar to the pH of fresh papaya juice (5.7). Endo-PG I alone reduced the viscosity of papaya juice by 17.6%, and increased its transmittance by 59.1%. When combined with a commercial pectin methylesterase, it showed much higher efficiency with a synergy degree of more than 1.25. All these favourable enzymatic properties make endo-PG I attractive for potential applications in the juice industry.

Detection of α-amylase and glucoamylase in crude fermentation extracts using a single native electrophoresis gel and zymogram is described in this article. Proteins were printed on substrate gel and simultaneously onto a membrane in a three-sandwich gel. α-Amylase was detected on the substrate gel with copolymerized β-limit dextrins and iodine reagent. Glucoamylases were detected on the membrane using a coupled assay for glucose detection. Both amylases were detected in native gel using starch and iodine reagent. The described technique can be a helpful tool for monitoring and control of fermentation processes because fungal amylase producers almost always synthesize both amylases.

D016428 D013485 	The bgl1 gene of Trichoderma reesei QM 9414 encodes an extracellular, cellulose-inducible beta-glucosidase involved in cellulase induction by sophorose.	We have investigated the effect of disruption of the bgl1-(beta-glucosidase l-encoding) gene of Trichoderma reesei on the formation of other beta-glucosidase activities and on the induction of cellulases. To this end the bgl1 locus was disrupted by insertion of the Aspergillus nidulans amdS (acetamidase-encoding) gene. The bgl1-disrupted strain did not produce the 75 kDa extracellular beta-glucosidase on cellulose or lactose, but still formed beta-glucosidase activity on glucose, cellobiose, xylan or beta-1,3-glucan, suggesting that the enzyme(s) exhibiting this beta-glucosidase activity is (are) not encoded by bgl1. The cellulase-inducer sophorose induced the bgl1-encoded beta-glucosidase, whereas the remaining beta-glucosidase activity was induced by methyl-beta-D-glucoside. The bgl1-gene product was mainly secreted into the medium, whereas the other beta-glucosidase activity was mainly associated with the cells. A bgl1-multicopy strain formed higher amounts of cellulases than the parent strain. Nonsaturating concentrations of sophorose efficiently induced cellobiohydrolase l formation in the bgl1-multicopy strain, but less efficiently in the bgl1-disrupted strain. The multicopy strain and the parent strain were comparably efficient at saturating sophorose concentrations. The beta-glucosidase inhibitor nojirimycin strongly inhibited induction in all strains. These data suggest that the bgl1-encoded beta-glucosidase is not identical to the plasma-membrane-bound, constitutive, methyl-beta-glucoside inducible beta-glucosidase, but represents an extracellular cellulose-induced enzyme. Both enzymes contribute to rapid induction of cellulases by modifying the inducer sophorose.

D016428 D013485 	Construction of a Streptomyces lydicus A01 transformant with a chit42 gene from Trichoderma harzianum P1 and evaluation of its biocontrol activity against Botrytis cinerea.	Streptomyces lydicus A01 and Trichoderma harzianum P1 are potential biocontrol agents of fungal diseases in plants. S. lydicus A01 produces natamycin to bind the ergosterol of the fungal cell membrane and inhibits the growth of Botrytis cinerea. T. harzianum P1, on the other hand, features high chitinase activity and decomposes the chitin in the cell wall of B. cinerea. To obtain the synergistic biocontrol effects of chitinase and natamycin on Botrytis cinerea, this study transformed the chit42 gene from T. harzianum P1 to S. lydicus A01. The conjugal transformant (CT) of S. lydicus A01 with the chit42 gene was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Associated chitinase activity and natamycin production were examined using the 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. The S. lydicus A01-chit42 CT showed substantially higher chitinase activity and natamycin production than its wild type strain (WT). Consequently, the biocontrol effects of S. lydicus A01-chit42 CT on B. cinerea, including inhibition to spore germination and mycelial growth, were highly improved compared with those of the WT. Our research indicates that the biocontrol effect of Streptomyces can be highly improved by transforming the exogenous resistance gene, i.e. chit42 from Trichoderma, which not only enhances the production of antibiotics, but also provides a supplementary function by degrading the cell walls of the pathogens.

Implications in plant-pathogen interactions.	Oligo-1,3-beta-glucosides with degrees of polymerization of 2-9 were labeled at their reducing terminal residues by catalytic tritiation. These substrates were used in detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analyses to examine substrate binding in 1,3-beta-D-glucan glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.39) isoenzymes GI, GII, and GIII from young seedlings of barley (Hordeum vulgare). Bond-cleavage frequencies, together with the kinetic parameter kcat/Km, have been calculated as a function of substrate chain length to define the number of subsites that accommodate individual beta-glucosyl residues and to estimate binding energies at each subsite. Each isoenzyme has eight beta-glucosyl-binding subsites. The catalytic amino acids are located between the third and fourth subsite from the nonreducing terminus of the substrate. Negative binding energies in subsites adjacent to the hydrolyzed glycosidic linkage suggest that some substrate distortion may occur in this region during binding and that the resultant strain induced in the substrate might facilitate hydrolytic cleavage. If the 1,3-beta-glucanases exert their function as pathogenesis-related proteins by hydrolyzing the branched or substituted 1,3;1,6-beta-glucans of fungal walls, it is clear that relatively extended regions of the cell wall polysaccharide must fit into the substrate-binding cleft of the enzyme.

Xylanase activity was detected among 34 of 77 fungal isolates derived from decaying wood, debris and soil samples collected in coastal mangrove environment of Hong Kong. Of those, three isolates CY2809 (Staganospora sp.), CY4786 and CY5040 were chosen for comparison of xylanase production in parallel to HU5048 (Aspergillus awamori), a terrestrial, highly productive isolate. Based on the assessment of mycelial biomass, xylanase activity and content of xylose-equivalent reducing sugars in their liquid cultures, the isolate CY4786 was best for xylanase production in a basal medium containing birchwood xylan (10.0 g/L) as a sole carbon source, yeast extract (2.5 g/L) and sea salts (15.0 g/L) with initial pH 7.8. When assayed at the optimized regime of 50 degrees C and pH 4.6, the activity of xylanase produced by CY4786 in 7d liquid culture at 25 degrees C reached 1.07 x 10(4) unit/mL. The results indicate that the mangrove fungi act as hemicellulose decomposers in the mangrove environment where highly xylanase-productive isolates can be searched for exploitation. A discussion is given on the possible use of the content of xylose-equivalent reducing sugars as an index to simplify conventional xylanase activity assay method for fungal isolate survey. 
12652873	20030326	Mikrobiyol_Bul	D004740 D016428 	[The existence of contamination in enzymes used for the isolation of Aspergillus and Candida species DNA].	Molecular biological methods which are widely used in different fields, have been replaced with conventional diagnostic tests for the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections, recently. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of these methods, with high specificity and sensitivity, which is accepted throughout the world. However, the enzymes that are used for the isolation of target DNA, may be contaminated with the gene sequences of some other fungal species in the preparation steps and may affect the PCR results. The studies showed that, the contamination of these enzymes with any type of fungi during their production steps, leads false positive results in PCR tests. So, the additional studies are recommended for minimizing the contamination. The aim of this study was to search whether the enzymes necessary for the isolation of fungal target DNA, used in PCR, are contaminated or not. For this purpose, five different enzymes namely, Zymolase 20T (from Arthrobacter luteus, two examples from different companies), lyticase (from Arthrobacter luteus), lysing enzyme (from Trichoderma harzianum) and proteinase K (from Tritrachium album) have been investigated for the presence of contamination. As a result, both of zymolase 20T enzymes were found to be contaminated from some fungal species with the demonstration of 18S rRNA gene sequences, while the other enzymes were found non-contaminated. By the help of this method, the most suitable enzyme for PCR was chosen and fungal contamination was prevented.

A strain F1 with high cellulase activity obtained from the deadwood stack was characterized as Ceriporia lacerate by examination of the general taxonomical characteristics and phylogenetic sequence analysis of rDNA ITS gene. The endoglucanase (EG) and filter paper cellulase (FPase) activities of the strain showed remarkable stability in the pH range of 4.0-7.0, and maintained about their maximal value of 76% and 50% after incubation at 70 degrees C for 6 h respectively. The strain grew particularly well with CMC-Na (1.0%) and yeast extract (0.4%) at 28 degrees C (pH 6.0) in flasks stirred at 150 x g for 6 days. Based on the thermostability and pH stability of cellulase, the strain appears to have potential in industrial applications and bioresource utilization.

Strain improvement was carried out to obtain higher chitinase and protein by inter-specific protoplast fusion between Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma viride. Fusant HF9 and parental strains of Trichoderma were compared for chitinase and protein production. 1% of glucose, sucrose and fungal cell wall (Rhizoctonia solani), were used as carbon source for cultivation of Trichoderma and fungal cell wall was the best to induce chitinase and protein. Usage of 0.5% colloidal chitin for the fungal growth under aerated conditions at pH 6.5 and 28 degrees C led to higher chitinase and protein production. In these conditions fusant Trichoderma HF9 in comparison with parent strains had 3-, 2.5- and 1.5-fold increase of total chitinase, specific chitinase and protein, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that it had 9 major protein bands with up-regulation compared to parent strains. Amino acid analysis showed that protein of culture filtrate of T. harzianum, T. viride and fusant Trichoderma HF9 had 8, 6 and 10 amino acids, respectively. The results obtained suggested that fusant HF9 could be an integration of T. harzianum and T. viride through protoplast fusion.

The goal of the study was to develop a reliable, reproducible and rapid method of culture in order to screen a large number of fungal transformants. The method is based upon miniaturized cell cultures and automated expression screening in microwell plates. For the method development, 50 recombinant Aspergillus vadensis clones producing feruloyl esterase B (FaeB) from Aspergillus niger were screened in 6 days. Then a panel of clones showing various behaviours was checked in flasks in order to demonstrate the reproducibility of the method. Using this method, a transformant of A. vadensis producing 1.2 g l(-1) of FaeB was selected (12-fold more than the A. niger overproducing strain). This miniaturized culture method allows to obtain reliable and reproducible results. The procedure has the advantages of being efficient, time-saving and more efficient than conventional in-flask culture screening as it can screen 800 clones per day after a culture of 3 days. This method could be applied to any other fungal strain culture, enzyme activity or biodiversity screening.

Streptomyces venezuelae P(10) could produce extracellular chitinase in a medium containing 0.6% colloidal chitin that was fermented for 96 hours at 30 degrees C. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity with 80% saturation of ammonium sulfate as shown by chitin affinity chromatography and DEAE-cellulose anion-exchange chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the enzyme showed a molecular weight of 66 kDa. The chitinase was characterized, and antifungal activity was observed against phytopathogens. Also, the first 15 N-terminal amino-acid residues of the chitinase were determined. The chitin hydrolysed products were N-acetylglucosamine and N, N'-diacetylchitobiose.

Beta-1,3-glucanase is an important cell wall-degrading enzyme involved in mycoparasitism by Trichoderma spp. during antagonism against phytopathogenic fungi. A simple microplate-based method to assay beta-1,3-glucanase activity is described here as an alternative to an expensive tube-assay method. The reaction volume of the micro-assay was reduced to 130 microl from the 1150 microl used in the standard beta-1,3-glucanase macro-assay. Statistical analyses showed significant difference in sensitivity between the micro- and the macro-assay. The micro-method was optimized using the Response Surface Quadratic Model. The sensitivity of the optimized micro-method was shown to be four-fold greater than the macro-assay and two-fold higher than the micro-assay. The optimized micro-assay was significantly more sensitive in all of the twenty examined isolates during Trichoderma spp. beta-1,3-glucanase screening. We conclude that this modified and optimized method is more convenient, faster, cheaper and more reproducible than the traditional tube-assay.

Verticillium wilt, caused by the soil borne fungal pathogen Verticillium albo-atrum, is a serious threat to hop (Humulus lupulus L.) production in several hop-growing regions. A proteomic approach was applied to analyse the response of root tissue in compatible and incompatible interactions between hop and V. albo-atrum at 10, 20 and 30 days after inoculation, using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with de novo sequencing of derivatized peptides. Approximately 1200 reproducible spots were detected on the gels, of which 102 were identified. In the compatible interaction, 252 spots showed infection-specific changes in spot abundance and an accumulation of defence-related proteins, such as chitinase, β-glucanase, thaumatin-like protein, peroxidase and germin-like protein, was observed. However, no significant infection-specific changes were detected in the incompatible interaction. The results indicate that resistance in this pathosystem may be conferred by constitutive rather than induced defence mechanisms. The identification and high abundance of two mannose/glucose-specific lectin isoforms present only in the roots of the resistant cultivar suggests function of lectins in hop resistance against V. albo-atrum.

A novel 36-kDa endochitinase named chit36 has been isolated and characterized from Trichoderma harzianum Rifai TM. Partial amino acid sequences from the purified protein were used to clone the fungal cDNA, based on polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers. The complete open reading frame encodes a 344-amino acid protein which shows 84% similarity to a putative chitinase from Streptomyces coelicolor. Chit36 was overexpressed under the pki1 constitutive promoter from Trichoderma reesei via biolistic transformation of T. harzianum TM. Stable transformants showed expression and endochitinase activity of chit36 in glucose-rich medium. Culture filtrates containing secreted CHIT36 as the sole chitinolytic enzyme completely inhibited the germination of Botrytis cinerea conidia. Growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis and Sclerotium rolfsii were significantly inhibited on agar plates on which the Trichoderma transformants had previously been grown.

High activities of extracellular pectinase with viscosity-diminishing and reducing groups-releasing activities were produced by Penicillium frequentans after 48 h at 35°C, in agitated cultures supplemented with 0.5% citrus pectin and initial pH of 2.5. Under these conditions the fungus also produced high activity of pectinesterase. At an initial pH of 7.0 or 8.0, pectin lyase activity was also detected. Enzyme activity releasing reducing sugars was more stable at 50°C than viscosity-diminishing activity. Both activities were maximal at pH 2.5 to 5.2 and at 55°C.  
10475745	19990904	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	An unusual pattern of invertase activity development in the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus.	In the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus, invertase displays an unusual pattern of development: the induced activity begins to diminish even before any substantial quantity of sucrose has been utilized or an appreciable amount of biomass has been produced. Despite this pattern of invertase activity, neither the growth rate nor the final mycelial yield is affected adversely. T. lanuginosus invertase is a thiol protein and the enzyme is active when specific sulfhydryl group(s) is in the reduced state. Measurements of reduced coenzyme and glutathione pools in sucrose-growth mycelia excluded oxidative stress as the primary reason for the observed decline in invertase activity. Rather, this unusual pattern of invertase is considered to be due to its localization in the hyphal tips. At the early stage of growth, the number of hyphal tips per unit mass of mycelium is maximum, whereas at later times their numbers do not increase in proportion to the biomass. As a result invertase activity shows an apparent inverse relationship with biomass. The enzyme activity disappears when the inducing carbon source is consumed and growth is completed.

The potential benefits of enzymatic digestion of intact yeast cells on anaerobic digestion of Scotch whisky distillery spent wash and pot ale were investigated. Various yeast cell wall hydrolytic enzymes were studied based on their effect on dissolution of cell wall glucan and mannoprotein. The synergistic activity of beta-glucanase and protease showed greater than 90% yeast cell digestion at 37 degrees C in 24h. The widely-used industrial enzyme papain showed 95% yeast cell digestion in spent wash at 1% enzyme concentration within 22h at 50 degrees C. Anaerobic digestion of pot ale residues containing intact yeast cells pre-treated with lytic enzymes showed COD reductions of 87%, compared with only 13% without enzymes. Similar results were observed with distillery spent wash centrate. The hydrolysis of intact yeast cells in distillery liquid residues was found to be a rate-limiting step in anaerobic treatment of such residues. 
6434506	19830801	J._Appl._Biochem.	D003160 D016428 	Fungal glucoamylases.	Glucoamylase (alpha-1,4-glucan glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.3) from fungal sources is one of the microbial glycoproteins that has received considerable attention particularly because it is used in the commercial production of dextrose. Several investigators have isolated glucoamylase from various fungal sources. In many instances the presence of more than one form of enzyme is common. The enzymes from most sources have pH optima between 4 and 5 and exhibit maximum activity between 40 and 60 degrees C. The enzyme does not require any cofactors for activity or for stability. The enzyme has an Mr between 48,000 and 80,000 and usually has no subunit structure. The amino acid composition of multiple forms of glucoamylases differ in general, but all of them are glycoproteins. The carbohydrate content of the enzyme ranges from 3 to 30% containing mainly mannose, but glucose, galactose, and in some instances glucosamine and xylose are also present. In the enzyme from Aspergillus the carbohydrate structures are present as mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharide units linked O-glycosidically through mannose to the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine. In the enzyme from Rhizopus part of the carbohydrate is present as disaccharide (Man-Man-) units linked O-glycosidically and the remainder is present as large heterosaccharide structures attached by N-glycosidic linkages involving aspargine and glucosamine. Carbohydrate moieties seem to have no influence on the enzyme activity or antigenicity but appear to stabilize the enzyme by preserving the three-dimensional structure.

20939889	20101014	Biotechnol_Biofuels	D016428 	Rapid optimization of enzyme mixtures for deconstruction of diverse pretreatment/biomass feedstock combinations.	Enzymes for plant cell wall deconstruction are a major cost in the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. The goal of this research was to develop optimized synthetic mixtures of enzymes for multiple pretreatment/substrate combinations using our high-throughput biomass digestion platform, GENPLAT, which combines robotic liquid handling, statistical experimental design and automated Glc and Xyl assays. Proportions of six core fungal enzymes (CBH1, CBH2, EG1, β-glucosidase, a GH10 endo-β1,4-xylanase, and β-xylosidase) were optimized at a fixed enzyme loading of 15 mg/g glucan for release of Glc and Xyl from all combinations of five biomass feedstocks (corn stover, switchgrass, Miscanthus, dried distillers' grains plus solubles [DDGS] and poplar) subjected to three alkaline pretreatments (AFEX, dilute base [0.25% NaOH] and alkaline peroxide [AP]). A 16-component mixture comprising the core set plus 10 accessory enzymes was optimized for three pretreatment/substrate combinations. Results were compared to the performance of two commercial enzymes (Accellerase 1000 and Spezyme CP) at the same protein loadings. When analyzed with GENPLAT, corn stover gave the highest yields of Glc with commercial enzymes and with the core set with all pretreatments, whereas corn stover, switchgrass and Miscanthus gave comparable Xyl yields. With commercial enzymes and with the core set, yields of Glc and Xyl were highest for grass stovers pretreated by AP compared to AFEX or dilute base. Corn stover, switchgrass and DDGS pretreated with AFEX and digested with the core set required a higher proportion of endo-β1,4-xylanase (EX3) and a lower proportion of endo-β1,4-glucanase (EG1) compared to the same materials pretreated with dilute base or AP. An optimized enzyme mixture containing 16 components (by addition of α-glucuronidase, a GH11 endoxylanase [EX2], Cel5A, Cel61A, Cip1, Cip2, β-mannanase, amyloglucosidase, α-arabinosidase, and Cel12A to the core set) was determined for AFEX-pretreated corn stover, DDGS, and AP-pretreated corn stover. The optimized mixture for AP-corn stover contained more exo-β1,4-glucanase (i.e., the sum of CBH1 + CBH2) and less endo-β1,4-glucanase (EG1 + Cel5A) than the optimal mixture for AFEX-corn stover. Amyloglucosidase and β-mannanase were the two most important enzymes for release of Glc from DDGS but were not required (i.e., 0% optimum) for corn stover subjected to AP or AFEX. As a function of enzyme loading over the range 0 to 30 mg/g glucan, Glc release from AP-corn stover reached a plateau of 60-70% Glc yield at a lower enzyme loading (5-10 mg/g glucan) than AFEX-corn stover. Accellerase 1000 was superior to Spezyme CP, the core set or the 16-component mixture for Glc yield at 12 h, but the 16-component set was as effective as the commercial enzyme mixtures at 48 h. The results in this paper demonstrate that GENPLAT can be used to rapidly produce enzyme cocktails for specific pretreatment/biomass combinations. Pretreatment conditions and feedstock source both influence the Glc and Xyl yields as well as optimal enzyme proportions. It is predicted that it will be possible to improve synthetic enzyme mixtures further by the addition of additional accessory enzymes.

Recombinant Penicillium griseoroseum strain 105 overproduces an extracellular pectin lyase (PL) under the transcriptional control of the strong gpdA promoter of Aspergillus nidulans. Our aim was to evaluate PL production by recombinant P. griseoroseum strain 105 in submerged fermentation system bioreactors BioFloIII and BioFloIV using 2 or 10 L working volumes under different growth conditions and to analyze the production of cellulase, polygalacturonase, pectin methylesterase, and protease. PL overproduction by recombinant P. griseoroseum strain 105 was 112 times higher than that of P. griseoroseum PG63 grown in sugarcane juice. Cellulases and proteases were not detected in the culture filtrate, and evaluation for extracellular proteins in the culture medium by SDS-PAGE showed the presence of a 36 kDa predominant band, similar to the molecular mass estimated from the nucleotide sequence of plg1 gene for PL of P. griseoroseum strain 105. This recombinant strain provides the advantage of PL production, which predominates over other extracellular proteins usually present in most commercial pectinase preparations, using sugarcane juice as a substrate of low cost. 
21462551	20110406	J._Eukaryot._Microbiol.	D016428 	Induction of cell wall thickening by the antifungal compound dihydromaltophilin disrupts fungal growth and is mediated by sphingolipid biosynthesis.	Dihydromaltophilin (heat-stable antifungal factor [HSAF]) is an antifungal metabolite produced in Lysobacter enzymogenes biocontrol strain C3. This compound induces cell wall thickening in Aspergillus nidulans. Here we show that the cell wall thickening is a general response to HSAF in diverse fungal species. In the A. nidulans model, the thickened cell wall negatively affects hyphal growth. Growth of HSAF-pre-treated hyphae failed to resume at hyphal tips with thick cell wall and the actin cable could not re-polarize at the thickened region of the cell wall, even after the treated hyphae were transferred to drug-free medium. Moreover, HSAF-induced cell wall thickening is mediated by sphingolipid synthesis: HSAF failed to induce cell wall thickening in the absence of ceramide synthase BarA and the sphingolipid synthesis inhibitor myriocin was able to suppress HSAF-induced cell wall thickening. The thickened cell wall could be digested by chitinase suggesting that chitin contributes to the HSAF-induced thickening. Furthermore, HSAF treatment activated the transcription of two chitin synthase encoding genes chsB and chsC. 
17606910	20070704	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D052061 	The evolution of N-glycan-dependent endoplasmic reticulum quality control factors for glycoprotein folding and degradation.	Asn-linked glycans (N-glycans) play important roles in the quality control (QC) of glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of proteins by cytosolic proteasomes. A UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase glucosylates N-glycans of misfolded proteins, which are then bound and refolded by calreticulin and/or calnexin in association with a protein disulfide isomerase. Alternatively, an alpha-1,2-mannosidase (Mns1) and mannosidase-like proteins (ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like proteins 1, 2, and 3) are part of a process that results in the dislocation of misfolded glycoproteins into the cytosol, where proteins are degraded in the proteasome. Recently we found that numerous protists and fungi contain 0-11 sugars in their N-glycan precursors versus 14 sugars in those of animals, plants, fungi, and Dictyostelium. Our goal here was to determine what effect N-glycan precursor diversity has on N-glycan-dependent QC systems of glycoprotein folding and ERAD. N-glycan-dependent QC of folding (UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, calreticulin, and/or calnexin) was present and active in some but not all protists containing at least five mannose residues in their N-glycans and was absent in protists lacking Man. In contrast, N-glycan-dependent ERAD appeared to be absent from the majority of protists. However, Trypanosoma and Trichomonas genomes predicted ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein and Mns1 orthologs, respectively, each of which had alpha-mannosidase activity in vitro. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the diversity of N-glycan-dependent QC of glycoprotein folding (and possibly that of ERAD) was best explained by secondary loss. We conclude that N-glycan precursor length has profound effects on N-glycan-dependent QC of glycoprotein folding and ERAD. 
19488757	20090603	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Characterization of the post-harvest changes in gene transcription in the gill of the Lentinula edodes fruiting body.	We compared the gene expression patterns of Lentinula edodes fresh fruiting bodies and fruiting bodies 3 days after harvest, by suppression subtractive hybridization, to characterize the physiologic changes that occur after harvest, such as gill browning and cell wall lysis of the fruiting body, which are responsible for the loss of food quality and value. We found increase of transcription levels of several enzyme encoding genes, such as, two phenol oxidases encoding genes (tyr tyrosinase, lcc4 laccase), and several cell wall degradation-related enzyme-encoding genes, such as mixed-linked glucanase (mlg1), chitinases (chi1, chi2), chitin deacetylase (chd1), and chitosanase (cho1), after harvesting. We isolated a putative transcription factor-encoding gene (L. edodes exp1) with high similarity to exp1 from Coprinopsis cinerea, which is involved in autolysis of the cap during spore diffusion. Transcription of L. edodes exp1 increased post-harvest, which suggests that its target genes are up-regulated after harvesting. These enzymes and the transcription factor may be involved in L. edodes fruiting body senescence. 
21506480	20110422	J_Environ_Biol	D016428 	Studies on in vitro degradability of mixed crude enzyme extracts produced from Pleurotus spp.	A preliminary investigation was conducted to assess lignocellulolytic efficiency of crude extracts from three white-rot fungi, Pleurotus florida PF05 (PF), Pleurotus sajor-caju PS07 (PS) and Pleurotus eryngii PE08 (PE). The activities of CMC-ase, xylanase, beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, laccase and Mn peroxidase in extracts were evaluated. PF produced its highest CMC-ase (317 UL(-1)'), beta-glucosidase (62 UL(-1)), beta-xylosidase (37 UL(-1)) and laccase (347 UL(-1)) activities while, PS produced highest xylanase (269 UL-(1)) and Mn peroxidase (69 UL(-1)) activities. In addition, crude extracts extracted were employed for their in vitro degradability assessment; and were evaluated with mono and mixed extracts separately to corn cob substrate. The losses in cell wall components and dry matter during 5 and 10 days incubations were analyzed after treatments of extracts. Maximum 8.2, 4.4 and 2.8% loss were found respectivelyin hemicellulose (HC), cellulose (C) and lignin (L) with mono extract of PF within 10 days. The influence of mono extract of each strain (PF PS and PE) and their mixed extracts (PF+PS, PF+PE, PS+PE and PF+PS+PE) on degradation of cell wall constituents were remarkably differed. The mixed extract treatment proved maximum 13.6% HC loss by PF+PS+PE extract, 9.2% loss in C by PF+PS extract and 5.2% loss of L by the PF+PS+PE extract treatment. The highest dry matter loss (8.2%) was recorded with PF+PS+PE mixed extract combination.

Trichoderma harzianum is a well-known biological control agent against fungal plant diseases. In order to select improved biocontrol strains from Trichoderma harzianum CECT 2413, a mutant has been isolated for its ability to produce wider haloes than the wild type, when hydrolysing pustulan, a polymer of beta-1,6-glucan. The mutant possesses between two and four times more chitinase, beta-1,3- and beta-1,6-glucanase activities than the wild type, produces about three times more extracellular proteins and secretes higher amounts of a yellow pigment (alpha-pyrone). This mutant performed better than the wild type during in vitro experiments, overgrowing and sporulating on Rhizoctonia solani earlier, killing this pathogen faster and exerting better protection on grapes against Botrytis cinerea. 
2500339	19890615	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 	Functional analysis of the signal-sequence processing site of yeast acid phosphatase.	A systematic study of the signal peptidase cleavage site of the main cell-wall-repressible Saccharomyces cerevisiae acid phosphatase encoded by the PHO5 gene is presented. The last amino acid of the signal sequence, the chromosomally encoded alanine of the wild-type gene, was changed by any of 19 other amino acids in the chromosomal DNA by using in vitro mutagenesis in Escherichia coli and the technique of gene replacement. Processing and secretion are normal when the amino acid at this position is a small neutral amino acid, i.e. alanine, glycine, cysteine, serine or threonine. Processing glycosylation, and secretion of regulated acid phosphatase are distinctly affected with other amino acid substitutions and core-glycosylated protein accumulates in the cell. Surprisingly, PHO5 protein is still secreted to the cell wall and into the growth medium but at a lower rate and without cleavage of the signal sequence. The same features are exhibited by a mutated acid phosphatase with a deletion of four amino acids at the end of the signal peptide (-7 to -4 relative to the processing site) thus preserving the important -3 to -1 region. 
23045615	20121010	J._Immunol.	D016430 D016428 D052061 D013485 	Hepoxilin A(3) facilitates neutrophilic breach of lipoxygenase-expressing airway epithelial barriers.	A feature shared by many inflammatory lung diseases is excessive neutrophilic infiltration. Neutrophil homing to airspaces involve multiple factors produced by several distinct cell types. Hepoxilin A(3) is a neutrophil chemoattractant produced by pathogen-infected epithelial cells that is hypothesized to facilitate neutrophil breach of mucosal barriers. Using a Transwell model of lung epithelial barriers infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we explored the role of hepoxilin A(3) in neutrophil transepithelial migration. Pharmacological inhibitors of the enzymatic pathways necessary to generate hepoxilin A(3), including phospholipase A(2) and 12-lipoxygenase, potently interfere with P. aeruginosa-induced neutrophil transepithelial migration. Both transformed and primary human lung epithelial cells infected with P. aeruginosa generate hepoxilin A(3) precursor arachidonic acid. All four known lipoxygenase enzymes capable of synthesizing hepoxilin A(3) are expressed in lung epithelial cell lines, primary small airway epithelial cells, and human bronchial epithelial cells. Lung epithelial cells produce increased hepoxilin A(3) and lipid-derived neutrophil chemotactic activity in response to P. aeruginosa infection. Lipid-derived chemotactic activity is soluble epoxide hydrolase sensitive, consistent with hepoxilin A(3) serving a chemotactic role. Stable inhibitory structural analogs of hepoxilin A(3) are capable of impeding P. aeruginosa-induced neutrophil transepithelial migration. Finally, intranasal infection of mice with P. aeruginosa promotes enhanced cellular infiltrate into the airspace, as well as increased concentration of the 12-lipoxygenase metabolites hepoxilin A(3) and 12-hydroxyeicosa-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-tetraenoic acid. Data generated from multiple models in this study provide further evidence that hepoxilin A(3) is produced in response to lung pathogenic bacteria and functions to drive neutrophils across epithelial barriers. 
16662850	19830301	Plant_Physiol.	D016428 	Phytoalexin Elicitor Activity of Carbohydrates from Phytophthora megasperma f.sp. glycinea and Other Sources.	Three unique classes of carbohydrates were isolated from the hyphal cell walls of Phytophthora megasperma f.sp. glycinea (Pmg) and compared with other substances for their activity as elicitors of the phytoalexin glyceollin in soybean tissues. Glucomannans extracted from cell walls with soybean beta-1,3-endoglucanase were purified and proved to be the most active elicitors yet reported. They were approximately 10 times more active in soybean cotyledons than the heterogeneous beta-glucan elicitor fraction extracted from Pmg walls. In addition, the glucomannan fraction gave race-specific elicitor activity in soybean hypocotyls. Pronase was found to be a suitable reagent for the mild extraction of glycopeptides from Pmg cell walls. All of the carbohydrates isolated from Pmg cell walls possessed significant elicitor activity, but other glucans, a glucomannan and mannan from other sources, were much less active. Chitin and chitosan, reported to function as elicitors in other plants, had low activity in soybean cotyledons. Arachidonic acid was inactive, despite its previously observed elicitor activity in potato tubers. The results indicated that, for Pmg, the carbohydrate elicitor most probably involved in the initiation of phytoalexinmediated defense during fungus infection of soybean plants is the glucomannan fraction liberated by endoglucanase. 
15090228	20040420	Assay_Drug_Dev_Technol	D003160 D016428 	Homogeneous assays for cellular protein degradation using beta-galactosidase complementation: NF-kappaB/IkappaB pathway signaling.	Activation of cells by the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokines results in activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via proteasomal degradation of an associated IkappaB molecule. To monitor cellular IkappaB, the protein was recombinantly expressed as a fusion protein with a novel enzymatic tag, ProLabel (PL). ProLabel is a small 5.5-kDa sequence from the amino-terminal amino acids of beta-galactosidase, possesses a simple ribbon structure, and can be fused to many proteins via the amino or carboxyl terminus. Expression of this construct allows quantitative detection of the recombinant protein in crude lysates by using a method based on beta-galactosidase enzyme fragment complementation (EFC). Transient transfection of IkappaB-PL in HeLa cells generated an EFC signal that was highly correlated with a western analysis of the protein construct. ProLabel expressed alone in the cells did not show any EFC activity, due to rapid proteolytic degradation, indicating a very low background signal from the protein tag. TNF-alpha and IL-1 treatment induced a concentration-dependent degradation of IkappaB-PL, with potency values similar to those reported using other methods. IkappaBM-PL (mutant of IkappaB-PL), in contrast, did not undergo degradation for concentrations up to and including 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha or IL-1, demonstrating that degradation of IkappaB-PL was specific to the NF-kappaB pathway activation. TNF-alpha and IL-1 induced maximal IkappaB-PL degradation within 30 min of induction. This was reversed by several agents that ablate this pathway, including anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132. The assay was amenable to HTS systems, with good precision and reproducibility. Z' values and coefficients of variance for IkappaB-PL degradation were 0.6 and <9%, respectively. 
12684541	20030410	Mol._Cell_Proteomics	D016428 	The transcriptome and its translation during recovery from cell cycle arrest in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Complete genome sequences together with high throughput technologies have made comprehensive characterizations of gene expression patterns possible. While genome-wide measurement of mRNA levels was one of the first applications of these advances, other important aspects of gene expression are also amenable to a genomic approach, for example, the translation of message into protein. Earlier we reported a high throughput technology for simultaneously studying mRNA level and translation, which we termed translation state array analysis, or TSAA. The current studies test the proposition that TSAA can identify novel instances of translation regulation at the genome-wide level. As a biological model, cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were cell cycle-arrested using either alpha-factor or the temperature-sensitive cdc15-2 allele. Forty-eight mRNAs were found to change significantly in translation state following release from alpha-factor arrest, including genes involved in pheromone response and cell cycle arrest such as BAR1, SST2, and FAR1. After the shift of the cdc15-2 strain from 37 degrees C to 25 degrees C, 54 mRNAs were altered in translation state, including the products of the stress genes HSP82, HSC82, and SSA2. Thus, regulation at the translational level seems to play a significant role in the response of yeast cells to external physical or biological cues. In contrast, surprisingly few genes were found to be translationally controlled as cells progressed through the cell cycle. Additional refinements of TSAA should allow characterization of both transcriptional and translational regulatory networks on a genomic scale, providing an additional layer of information that can be integrated into models of system biology and function. 
4767299	19731201	Appl_Microbiol	D016428 	Influence of temperature and humidity on microbial, enzymatic, and physical changes of stored, pickling cucumbers.	Pickling cucumbers stored at five temperatures and four relative humidities were examined for growth of eight microbial groups, the activities of two enzyme systems (pectinolytic and cellulolytic), and weight loss. Twenty-four storage tests for 6 days each were conducted during the 2-year study. In general, microbial populations of the eight groups increased rapidly at the higher temperature (>21 C) and humidity (>70%) treatments. Moisture loss of the cucumbers was rapid with combinations of high temperatures and low humidities. The results suggest that the best environmental conditions for storage or transport of cucumbers would be a combination of low temperature (10 C) with high relative humidity (about 95%). These conditions minimized undesirable microbial, enzymatic, and physical changes of stored, pickling cucumbers. 
17103162	20061115	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 	Role of hydrolytic enzymes and oxidative stress in autolysis and morphology of Blakeslea trispora during beta-carotene production in submerged fermentation.	The role of hydrolytic enzymes (proteases and chitinase) and oxidative stress in the autolysis and morphology of Blakeslea trispora during beta-carotene production from a chemically defined medium in shake flask culture was investigated. The process of cellular autolysis was studied by measuring the changes in biomass dry weight, pH, concentration of beta-carotene, specific activity of the hydrolytic enzymes and micromorphology of the fungus using a computerized image analysis system. In addition, the phenomenon of autolysis was associated with high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of ROS produced during fermentation causes oxidative stress in B. trispora. Oxidative stress was examined in terms of the activities of two key defensive enzymes: catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The profile of the specific activities of the above enzymes appeared to correlate with the oxidative stress of the fungus. The high activities of CAT and SOD showed that B. trispora is found under oxidative stress during beta-carotene production. The culture began to show signs of autolysis nearly in the growth phase and autolysis increased significantly during the production phase. The morphological differentiation of the fungus was a result of the degradation of the cell membrane by hydrolytic enzymes and oxidative stress. Increased beta-carotene production is correlated with intense autolysis of clumps, which has as a consequence the increase of the freely dispersed mycelia. 
1103165	19750101	Physiol._Chem._Phys.	D016428 	Trehalose and glycogen levels during the initial stages of growth of Candida albicans.	Yeast phase cells of Candida albicans were extracted with cold 0.5 M trichloroacetic acid. The only quantitatively significant anthrone-positive material in these extracts was trehalose which was identified chromatographically and enzymatically. Glycogen in the residue was digested with amyloglucosidase to free glucose which was assayed by a glucose oxidase method. Washed cells from a stationary phase culture of C. albicans rapidly decreased their trehalose content during the early phases of growth on a fresh glucose-containing medium. Concurrent increases in total glycogen concentration were of a greater magnitude than could be accounted for by trehalose mobilization. Thus a specific role for trehalose during initial growth is indicated and is compared with other fungal systems. Trehalase activity was measured in situ and showed only minor changes during the time intervals of these experiments in contrast to other reports on S. cerevisiae. A large fraction of the enzyme in C. albicans behaved as external to the protoplasmic membrane. On one type of growth medium C. albicans exhibited (in addition to trehalose) variable amounts of a sugar alcohol in trichloroacetic acid extracts. This has tentatively been identified as arabitol.

23023416	20121002	Yakugaku_Zasshi	D016428 D016454 	[Study on the discovery of novel chitinase inhibitors based on natural products].	Chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature, is a constituent of fungal cell walls, the exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects and the microfilarial sheaths of parasitic nematodes. Chitin has, so far, not been found in mammals. Accumulation of chitin by organisms is modulated by chitin synthase-mediated biosynthesis and by chitinase-mediated hydrolytic degradation. Thus, chitinases are expected to be specific targets for antifungal, insecticidal and antiparasitic agents. Paradoxically, while chitin does not exist in mammals, human chitinase family members, such as acidic mammalian chitinase, have recently been described, and offer significant potential for the treatment of asthma and other related diseases in humans. This review covers the development of two chitinase inhibitors of natural origin, Argifin and Argadin, isolated from the cultured broth of microorganisms in our laboratory. In particular, the practical total synthesis of these natural products and discovery methods that generate only highly-active compounds using a kinetic target (chitinase)-guided synthesis approach (termed in situ click chemistry) are described.

Fungi have been suspected of contributing to the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. A previous intervention study demonstrated an improvement in the clinical condition in 15 out of 18 patients with a long-term history of sarcoidosis when antifungal medication was added to corticosteroids. The present study was performed to compare the effects of antifungal treatment with corticosteroid treatment in sarcoidosis. Patients with newly diagnosed sarcoidosis were recruited. Corticosteroids were given to 39 subjects, corticosteroid + antifungal to 31, and antifungal only to 22 subjects. The effects of the treatments were evaluated at 6 months. X-ray scores were measured before and after treatment together with pulmonary diffusion capacity and two markers of sarcoidosis activity, that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum (sACE) and chitotriosidase (CTO). X-ray scores as well as sACE and CTO decreased significantly in all groups. The X-ray score decreased slightly more among subjects in the groups that received antifungal medication compared with corticosteroids only (p < 0.001). The results suggest that antifungal treatment is as efficient as corticosteroid treatment against the granulomatous and inflammatory manifestations of sarcoidosis. This is probably because this treatment is directed towards the causative agent. Additional studies are required to define the phenotype, where the antifungal treatment was not efficient (4/22) and to perform long-term follow up to determine the risk of recurrence.

Axenic strains were differentiated with API 20C AUX and API ZYM tests (bioMérieux). Then enzymograms and biotypes were determined for all the strains based on the activity of 19 hydrolases. The highest activity was noted for: e2 - phosphatase alcaline, e6 - leucine arylamidase, e11 - phosphatase acid, e5 - lipase (c14); e7 - valine arylamidase, e12 - naphtol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, e16 - alpha-glucosidase and e18 - N-acetyl-beta-glucosamidase, and the latter four were used for biotyping procedures. Our own system was based on the mathematical binominal distribution formula (1 : 4 : 6 : 4 : 1): all "+"; one "-", three "+"; two "-", two "+"; three "-", one "+"; all "-". We have found the following biotypes: A (16.1 +/- 3.5%), B1 (2.7 +/- 2.53%), B3 (8.0 +/- 2.5%), B4 (22.3 +/- 3.9%), C2 (1.8 +/- 1.3%), C3 (7.1 +/- 2.4%), C6 (30.4 +/- 4.3%), D, (11.6 +/- 3.0%).

Cellulosomes can be described as one of nature's most elaborate and highly efficient nanomachines. These cell bound multienzyme complexes orchestrate the deconstruction of cellulose and hemicellulose, two of the most abundant polymers on Earth, and thus play a major role in carbon turnover. Integration of cellulosomal components occurs via highly ordered protein:protein interactions between cohesins and dockerins, whose specificity allows the incorporation of cellulases and hemicellulases onto a molecular scaffold. Cellulosome assembly promotes the exploitation of enzyme synergism because of spatial proximity and enzyme-substrate targeting. Recent structural and functional studies have revealed how cohesin-dockerin interactions mediate both cellulosome assembly and cell-surface attachment, while retaining the spatial flexibility required to optimize the catalytic synergy within the enzyme complex. These emerging advances in our knowledge of cellulosome function are reviewed here.

The Aspergillus aculeatus beta-glucosidase 1 (bgl1) gene was expressed in a lactic-acid-producing Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain to enable lactic fermentation with cellobiose. The recombinant beta-glucosidase enzyme was expressed on the yeast cell surface by fusing the mature protein to the C-terminal half region of the alpha-agglutinin. The beta-glucosidase expression plasmids were integrated into the genome. Three strong promoters of S. cerevisiae, the TDH3, PGK1, and PDC1 promoters, were used for beta-glucosidase expression. The specific beta-glucosidase activity varied with the promoter used and the copy number of the bgl1 gene. The highest activity was obtained with strain PB2 that possessed two copies of the bgl1 gene driven by the PDC1 promoter. PB2 could grow on cellobiose and glucose minimal medium at the same rate. Fermentation experiments were conducted in non-selective-rich media containing 95 g l(-1) cellobiose or 100 g l(-1) glucose as a carbon source under microaerobic conditions. The maximum rate of L-lactate production by PB2 on cellobiose (2.8 g l(-1) h(-1)) was similar to that on glucose (3.0 g l(-1) h(-1)). This indicates that efficient fermentation of cellobiose to L-lactate can be accomplished using a yeast strain expressing beta-glucosidase from a mitotically stable genomic integration plasmid.

Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) are enzymes produced by bacteria, fungi and higher plants. They belong to the carbohydrate esterase family CE-8. This study deals with comparison of 127 amino acid sequences of this family containing the five characteristic sequence segments: 44_GxYxE, 113_QAVAL, 135_QDTL, 157_DFIFG, 223_LGRPW (Daucus carota numbering). Six strictly conserved residues (Gly44, Gly154, Asp157, Gly161, Arg225 and Trp227) and six conservative ones (Ile39, Ser86, Ser137, Ile152, Ile159 and Leu223) were identified. A set of 70 representative PMEs was created. The sequences were aligned and the evolutionary tree based on the alignment was calculated. The tree reflected the taxonomy: the fungal and bacterial PMEs formed their own clusters and the plant enzymes were grouped into eight separate clades. The plant PME from Vitis riparia was placed in a common clade with fungi. Three plant clades (Plant 1, 2 and 3) were relatively homogenous reflecting high degree of mutual sequence identity. The clade Plant 4 contained PMEs from flower parts (mostly form pollen) and was heterogenous, like the clades Plant 1a and 2a, which moreover exhibit an intermediate character. The clades Plant X1 and X2 were situated in the tree close to microbial clades and represented atypical plant PMEs. Taking into account the remaining plant PMEs, an expanded plant alignment and tree (with most Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa enzymes), were prepared. An exclusive Arabidopsis alignment and tree indicated the existence of a new plant clade X3. In the pre pro region of most plant enzymes a longer conserved segment containing basic dipeptide, R(K)/R(K), that precedes the N-terminal end of PME was revealed. This was not observed in the clade Plant X1 and majority of the clade Plant X2. This study brings further the description of occurrence of potential glycosylation sites in pre pro sequences and in mature enzymes as well as important amino acid residues, such as aspartates, cysteines, histidines and other aromatic residues (Tyr, Phe and Trp), with discussion of their possible function in the activity of PMEs. 
10769178	20000419	Biochem._J.	D016428 	Identification of the catalytic residues of the first family of beta(1-3)glucanosyltransferases identified in fungi.	A new family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored beta(1-3)glucanosyltransferases (Gelp), recently identified and characterized in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, showed functional similarity to the Gas/Phr/Epd protein families, which are involved in yeast morphogenesis. Sequence comparisons and hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) showed that all the Gas/Phr/Epd/Gel proteins belong to a new family of glycosylhydrolases, family 72. We confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analysis that the two conserved glutamate residues (the putative catalytic residues of this family, as determined by HCA) are involved in the active site of this family of glycosylhydrolases.

This study examines the inhibitory effects of water extract from longan twigs (WLTs) on mutation and nitric oxide (NO) production. The results show that WLT inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA), an indirect mutagen, and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct mutagen toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. In addition, WLT in the range 0-0.6 mg/ml showed radical scavenging, reducing activities and chelating activity, as well as decreased lipid oxidative damage. Meanwhile, WLT also inhibited tyrosinase activity and NO generation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated macrophages. High performance liquid chromatography analysis suggests that the major phenolic constituents in WLT are epicatechin, ellagic acid and gallic acid. These bioactive components may contribute to the protective effects of WLT. Our data suggests that WLT can be applied to antimutation, anti-inflammation and antityrosinase.

The inhibitory activity from the isolated component of the fruiting body Phellinus merrillii (PM) was evaluated against α-glucosidase and lens aldose reductase from Sprague-Dawley male rats and compared to the quercetin as an aldose reductase inhibitor and acarbose as an α-glucosidase inhibitor. The ethanol extracts of PM (EPM) showed the strong α-glucosidase and aldose reductase activities. α-Glucosidase and aldose reductase inhibitors were identified as hispidin (A), hispolon (B), and inotilone (C), which were isolated from EtOAc-soluble fractions of EPM. The above structures were elucidated by their spectra and comparison with the literatures. Among them, hispidin, hispolon, and inotilone exhibited potent against α-glucosidase inhibitor activity with IC(50) values of 297.06 ± 2.06, 12.38 ± 0.13, and 18.62 ± 0.23 μg/mL, respectively, and aldose reductase inhibitor activity with IC(50) values of 48.26 ± 2.48, 9.47 ± 0.52, and 15.37 ± 0.32 μg/mL, respectively. These findings demonstrated that PM may be a good source for lead compounds as alternatives for antidiabetic agents currently used. The importance of finding effective antidiabetic therapeutics led us to further investigate natural compounds.

Here we demonstrate additionally the association of FKBP22 with the molecular chaperones and folding catalysts Grp170, alpha-subunit of glucosidase II, PDI, ERp38, and CyP23. These proteins are associated with FKBP22 in at least two protein complexes. Furthermore, we report an essential role for FKBP22 in the development of microconidiophores in Neurospora crassa. 
12952640	20030904	Proc._Biol._Sci.	D016428 D013485 	Evidence for the presence of a cellulase gene in the last common ancestor of bilaterian animals.	Until recently, the textbook view of cellulose hydrolysis in animals was that gut-resident symbiotic organisms such as bacteria or unicellular eukaryotes are responsible for the cellulases produced. This view has been challenged by the characterization and sequencing of endogenous cellulase genes from some invertebrate animals, including plant-parasitic nematodes, arthropods and a mollusc. Most of these genes are completely unrelated in terms of sequence, and their evolutionary origins remain unclear. In the case of plant-parasitic nematodes, it has been suggested that their ancestor obtained a cellulase gene via horizontal gene transfer from a prokaryote, and similar suggestions have been made about a cellulase gene recently discovered in a sea squirt. To improve understanding about the evolution of animal cellulases, we searched for all known types of these enzymes in GenBank, and performed phylogenetic comparisons. Low phylogenetic resolution was found among most of the sequences examined, however, positional identity in the introns of cellulase genes from a termite, a sea squirt and an abalone provided compelling evidence that a similar gene was present in the last common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes. In a different enzyme family, cellulases from beetles and plant-parasitic nematodes were found to cluster together. This result questions the idea of lateral gene transfer into the ancestors of the latter, although statistical tests did not allow this possibility to be ruled out. Overall, our results suggest that at least one family of endogenous cellulases may be more widespread in animals than previously thought.

10773444	20000425	Gene	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Zero background yeast reporter plasmids.	UAS-less reporter plasmids are widespread and powerful tools for the identification and analysis of binding sites for transcriptional activators. The common reporter plasmids for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are multicopy (2mu) vectors with the CYC1 core promoter upstream of the lacZ gene. Insertion of putative or known activator binding sites upstream of the core promoter puts lacZ (beta-galactosidase) expression under the control of the corresponding activator. Although these constructs have proved to work well for most purposes, they have certain limitations: (1) they give significant and carbon-source-dependent lacZ background expression; (2) unlike most other yeast promoters, the CYC1 upstream region has a partially open chromatin structure with an accessible TATA box; (3) they use only a single, moderately sensitive reporter; and (4) the use of multicopy vectors can result in activator titration. Here, we introduce novel reporter plasmids based on the yeast MEL1 (alpha-galactosidase) gene that can overcome all of these limitations. It is also shown that background expression is due to fortuitous activator binding sites within the plasmid backbones that are insufficiently shielded from the core promoters in the common CYC1 reporter plasmids.

Based on morphological characteristics the taxa included in the Aspergillus aggregate can hardly be differentiated. For that reason the phylogeny of this genus was revised several times as different criteria, from morphological to later molecular, were used. We found, comparing nucleotide sequences of the ITS-region, that the strain Aspergillus niger (DSM 823) which is claimed to be identical to the strains ATCC 10577, IMI 027809, NCTC 7193 and NRRL 2322 can be molecularly classified as Aspergillus tubingensis, exhibiting 100% identity with the A. tubingensis CBS strains 643.92 and 127.49. We amplified, cloned and sequenced a new glucoamylase gene (glaA) from this strain of A. tubingensis (A. niger DSM 823) using primers derived from A. niger glucoamylase G1. The amplified cDNA fragment of 2013 bp contained an open reading frame encoding 648 amino acid residues. The calculated molecular mass of the glucoamylase, deduced from the amino acid sequence, was 68 kDa. The nucleotide sequence of glaA showed 99% similarity with glucoamylases from Aspergillus kawachii and Aspergillus shirousami, whereas the similarity with the glucoamylase G1 from A. niger was 92%

In this paper we report some characteristics of the ADPG-dependent trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. As opposed to the UDPG-dependent enzyme, the ADPG-dependent activity did not respond to a glucose signal nor to a heat shock. Mutant strains, deficient in the UDPG-dependent enzyme but possessing the ADPG-dependent activity, did not accumulate trehalose either during growth or during sporulation. A diploid, homozygous for the deficiency in the UDPG-dependent synthase activity, was constructed. During sporulation the ADPG-dependent activity remained constant. However, when mutant spores were subjected to a glucose signal, trehalose was accumulated to the same extent as in control spores. 
20674735	20100803	Microb._Pathog.	D016428 D013485 	Increased virulence using engineered protease-chitin binding domain hybrid expressed in the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana.	Insect cuticles consist mainly of interlinked networks of proteins and the highly insoluble polysaccharide, chitin. Entomopathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria bassiana, invade insects by direct penetration of host cuticles via the action of diverse hydrolases including proteases and chitinases coupled to mechanical pressure. In order to better target cuticle protein-chitin structures and accelerate penetration speed, a hybrid protease (CDEP-BmChBD) was constructed by fusion of a chitin binding domain BmChBD from Bombyx mori chitinase to the C-terminal of CDEP-1, a subtilisin-like protease from B. bassiana. Compared to the wild-type, the hybrid protease was able to bind chitin and released greater amounts of peptides/proteins from insect cuticles. The insecticidal activity of B. bassiana was enhanced by including proteases, CDEP-1 or CDEP:BmChBD produced in Pichia pastoris, as an additive, however, the augment effect of CDEP:BmChBD was significantly higher than that of CDEP-1. Expression of the hybrid protease in B. bassiana also significantly increased fungal virulence compared to wild-type and strains overexpressing the native protease. These results demonstrate that rational design virulence factor is a potential strategy for strain improvement by genetic engineering. 
7600007	19950501	Microbiol._Res.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Comparative biochemical, genetical and immunological studies of glucoamylase producing Arxula adeninivorans yeast strains.	Seven Arxula adeninivorans strains originating from The Netherlands (CSIR 1136, CSIR 1138 and CBS 8244T), South Africa (CSIR 1147, CSIR 1148 and CSIR 1149) and Siberia (Ls3) were compared concerning their secretory glucoamylase. Within the spectrum of secretory polypeptides obtained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the glucoamylase corresponding polypeptide, could be identified by means of specific antibodies directed against the glucoamylase of strain Ls3. The molecular masses of the glucoamylases vary from 84 to 95 kDa. After endoglycosidase F treatment of the secretory proteins, the N-linked carbohydrate content for each glucoamylase could be quantified at about 25%. Glucoamylase activity staining of secretory proteins separated under nondenaturing conditions revealed one glucoamylase active protein for the Dutch strains and two active forms for the strains originating from South Africa and Siberia. Highest activities of glucoamylase can be measured at the end of the exponential growth phase for each strain. The Dutch strain CSIR 1138 secretes the highest activity. Optimum values for temperature and pH were determined and compared. By means of pulsed field gel electrophoresis and Southern analysis, the glucoamylase corresponding gene could be localized on the second of the four chromosomes of each yeast strain.

The effect of cations, anions and specific chemical reagents: 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodimide methiodide, EDTA, o-phenantroline, dithiotreitol, L-cysteine, beta-mercaptoethanol, p-chlormercurybenzoate (p-ChMB), N-ethylmaleimide on the alpha-L-rhamnosidase activity of Cryptococcus albidus has been investigated. The essential role of Ag+ which inhibits the alpha-L-rhamnosidase activity by 72.5% was shown. Rhamnose at 1-5 mM protect the enzyme from the negative effect of Ag(+). It was expected that carboxyl group of C-terminal aminoacid and imidazole group of histidine would participate in the catalytic action of alpha-L-rhamnosidase on the basis of inhibition and kinetic analysis. 
8519779	19951212	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Structures of oligosaccharide-bound forms of the endoglucanase V from Humicola insolens at 1.9 A resolution.	Cellulose, a polymer of beta-1,4-linked glucose residues, is the major polysaccharide component of plant cell walls and the most abundant biopolymer. The underlying mechanisms of the enzymatic degradation of cellulose are of increasing commercial and ecological significance. Endoglucanase V, from the cellulolytic soil hyphomycete Humicola insolens, is an endocellulase, the catalytic core of which consists of 210 amino acids and is known to hydrolyze the beta-1,4 links with inversion of configuration at the anomeric carbon. The major products of cellulose hydrolysis are cellobiose and cellotriose. The crystal structures of the endoglucanase V (EGV) from H. insolens, in native, product (cellobiose), inactive mutant (D10N), and oligosaccharide-bound [(D10N)-cellohexaose] forms, have been determined at resolutions of 1.9 A or better. EGV consists of a six-stranded beta-barrel domain with long interconnecting loops. A 40 A groove exists along the surface of the enzyme, and this contains the catalytic residues, Asp 10 and Asp 121. The two catalytic aspartates sit to either side of the substrate binding groove in an ideal conformation for facilitating cleavage by inversion, their carboxyl groups being separated by approximately 8.5 A. The complex between substrate and inactive mutant reveals excellent density for an oligosaccharide in six of the enzyme's seven substrate binding subsites. No sugar moiety, however, is seen bound to the -1 subsite at the point of cleavage. The geometry of the cleavage site suggests that the enzyme would favor the binding of sugars with an elongated glycosidic bond, as found in the transition state, as opposed to the binding of substrate. The oligosaccharide complexes reveal solvent water suitably placed for participation in a single displacement reaction as first suggested by Koshland in 1953 [Koshland, D. E. (1953) Biol. Rev. 28, 416-436]. A large conformational change takes place upon substrate binding. This "lid flipping" has the effect of increasing the hydrophobic environment of the catalytic proton donor, enclosing the active site at the point of cleavage, and bringing a third aspartate (Asp 114) in close proximity to the substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic residues has been used to confirm their significance in catalysis.

Penicillium canescens strain F178 is a natural producer of beta-galactosidase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase. Tanscription of genes bgaS and xylA coding for these proteins is subject to carbon catabolite repression which proceed mainly in filamentous fungi by transcriptional repressor CreA. creA gene of P. canescens was cloned. It was demonstrated that creA transcription is also subject to carbon catabolite repression. CreA protein remains intranuclear independently of nature of carbon source and glucose concentration in culture medium. In vitro experiments confirm availability of four CreA-binding sites in bgaS promoter, four sites in xylA promoter and one such site in creA promoter. 
8947054	19961115	EMBO_J.	D016428 D013486 	Ligand interactions with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2: role of the gamma-subunit.	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) comprises three non-identical subunits alpha, beta and gamma. In vitro, eIF-2 binds the initiator methionyl-tRNA in a GTP-dependent fashion. Based on similarities between eukaryotic eIF-2gamma proteins and eubacterial EF-Tu proteins, we previously proposed a major role for the gamma-subunit in binding guanine nucleotide and tRNA. We have tested this hypothesis by examining the biochemical activities of yeast eIF-2 purified from wild-type strains and strains harboring mutations in the eIF-2gamma structural gene (GCD11) predicted to alter ligand binding by eIF-2. The alteration of tyrosine 142 in yeast eIF-2gamma, corresponding to histidine 66 in Escherichia coli EF-Tu, dramatically reduced the affinity of eIF-2 for Met-tRNAi(Met) without affecting the k(off) value for guanine nucleotides. In contrast, non-lethal substitutions at a conserved lysine residue (K250) in the putative guanine ring-binding loop increased the off-rate for GDP, thereby mimicking the function of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF-2B, without altering the apparent dissociation constant for Met-tRNAi(Met). For eIF-2[gamma-K250R], the increased off-rate also seen for GTP was masked by the presence of Met-tRNAi(Met) in vitro. In vivo, increasing the dose of the yeast initiator tRNA gene suppressed the slow-growth phenotype and reduced GCN4 expression in gcd11-K250R and gcd11-Y142H strains. These studies indicate that the gamma-subunit of eIF-2 does indeed provide EF-Tu-like function to the eIF-2 complex, and further suggest that the level of Met-tRNAi(Met) is critical for maintaining wild-type rates of initiation in vivo.

Bacillus cereus QQ308 produced antifungal hydrolytic enzymes, comprising chitinase, chitosanase and protease, when grown in a medium containing shrimp and crab shell powder (SCSP) produced from marine waste. The growth of the plant-pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Pythium ultimum were considerably affected by the presence of the QQ308 culture supernatant. The supernatant inhibited spore germination and germ tube elongation of F. oxysporum, F. solani, and P. ultimum. The increase in the growth time of the fungal culture was associated with a gradual decrease in inhibition. Besides antifungal activity, QQ308 enhanced growth of Chinese cabbage. These characteristics were unique among known strains of B. cereus. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the antifungal and Chinese cabbage growth enhancing compounds produced by B. cereus.

In the recent past a great number of proteins causing type 1 allergic reactions in humans have been isolated and characterised. The main sources containing allergens are plants, mites, fungal spores and insects. Plant-derived allergens may either be taken in from the upper respiratory tract or they are present in a vast range of plant food causing food allergic reactions. Compared to the enormous amount of different plant proteins only a small number out of them are identified as a an allergen at present. Looking at the allergen encoding sequences, relationships by sequence similarity can be found quite frequently to a restricted number of plant protein families. Predominantly, these protein families are seed storage proteins, structural proteins and proteins involved in the defence-related system - pathogenesis-related proteins. In the following, a short overview of a number of pathogenesis-related protein families is presented in relation to the already known homologous plant allergens.

Enzymes such as mucinase, dehydrated pancreas, enzymes of fungal origin, dextranase and mutanase showed limited clinical success despite promising in vitro and animal studies. Side effects from the use of enzymes were observed. Many antibiotics have been used in attempts to control plaque and several have been successful. However, problems exist from the long-term use of such drugs which precludes their routine use as agents for controlling plaque. The biguanide chlorhexidine is the most widely used and investigated method of chemical plaque control. Many studies have been demonstrated that it will successfully control plaque. No toxic side effects have been reported from its long-term use but local side effects such as staining of the teeth do occur. The quaternary ammonium compounds have at present no advantages over the biguanides and require more frequent usage to achieve the same degree of plaque control as chlorhexidine.

The enzyme-gold approach was applied for ultrastructural localization of glucoside residues in animal and plant tissues. A beta-glucosidase-gold complex was prepared and used on thin tissue sections to reveal the corresponding substrate molecules by electron microscopy. Conditions for preparation of the complex, as well as for its application, were determined. Once applied on thin tissue sections, the glucosidase-gold complex yielded labeling over the rough endoplasmic reticulum, mainly on the ribosomal side of the membranes, and over the dense chromatin in the nucleus. Mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and secretory granules in liver and pancreatic cells were free of gold particles. In plant cells, the labeling pattern was similar. In addition, the stroma regions of chloroplasts were densely labeled. In the extracellular space, labeling was found over the basal laminae of cells in animal tissues and over the fibrillar wall material bordering the intercellular space in plant tissues. Fungal cell cytoplasm was also labeled, as well as the membrane delineating mycoplasma-like organisms. Control conditions confirmed these labelings, demonstrating the possibility of revealing glucoside residues on tissue sections with high resolution and specificity.

Thermomyces lanuginosus is thermophilic fungus in which was isolated from widespread material. A high number of this fungus was found in composts especially mushroom composts. This fungus has been reported to produce a high level xylanase when cultivated in the medium containing xylan and corn cob as a carbon source. Various strains of T. lanuginosus produced a single xylanase with molecular masses in range of 22.0 to 29.0 kDa. Pure beta-xylanase obtained from various strains of this fungus exhibited highly stability at high temperature and wide pH range. The optimal temperature and optimal pH of pure beta-xylanase from various strains of T. lanuginosus have been reported in range of 60-75 degrees C and pH 6.0-7.0, respectively. The great thermal stability was resulting from the present of hydrophilic amino acid on beta sheet of the surface of xylanase structure. Moreover, the relatedness between high and low xylanase producing strains can be distinguish by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Based on nucleotide sequences and T. lanuginosus xylanase gene has been classified to be a member of family 11 (formerly known as cellulase family G) glycosyl hydrolases. This enzyme was endo-type xylanase having main product are xylose and xylobiose. The expression of xylanase gene from T. lanuginosus was achieved in Escherichia coli and methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The ability of T. lanuginosus in which produced large amount of high thermos stable xylanase has made this fungus to be a source of xylanase production for biobleaching in pulp and paper process.

This paper reports the first isolation from cultures of two endoxylanases secreted by  Fusarium graminearum  Schwabe [teleomorph  Gibberella zeae  (Schweinitz) Petch]. When F. graminearum is grown on wheat bran hydrated with a modified synthetic medium, high xylanase activity can be extracted. The two endoxylanases were identified by LC-MS/MS as the products of genes FGSG_6445 (Genbank gene id  2788192 ) (xylanase 1) and FGSG_3624 (GenBank accession no.  AJ863566 ) (xylanase 2) with 61 and 51% sequence coverage, respectively. Both enzymes showed a pH optimum at pH 6, with xylanase 1 exhibiting a wider active pH range (5.5-9) than xlylanase 2 (5.5-7.5). Their temperature dependences were similar, >60% between 35 and 60 °C, with optimal temperatures of 45 °C for xylanase 1 and 50 °C for xylanase 2. Kinetic studies found that both enzymes had a lower K(m) for linear beachwood xylan than arabinoxylan. For xylanase 2, the V(max) increased with arabinoxylan, but decreased for xylanase 1.

Glucoamylase cDNA synthesized from A. niger mutant T21 was modified at 5' and 3' ends in order to clone it into yeast shuttle plasmid YFD18 and to cause fusion between cDNA and the leader region of the yeast-mating pheromone alpha-factor. The modified cDNA was then inserted into YFD18 at HindIII site. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y33 was transformed with the resultant recombinant plasmid YFD18HH6. Analysis of transformants including halo formation on starch medium plate, SDS-PAGE of culture filtration and determination of glucoamylase activity showed that the yeast transformed with plasmid containing glucoamylase cDNA efficiently secreted glucoamylase into the medium. This fact indicated that yeast alpha-factor was able to direct the synthesis and secretion of functional glucoamylase of Aspergillus. In addition the protolytic cleavage site involved in the maturation of glucoamylase in A. niger also worked in S. cerevisiae.

The three-dimensional structure of Aspergillus aculeatus beta-1,4-galactanase (AAGAL), an enzyme involved in pectin degradation, has been determined by multiple isomorphous replacement to 2.3 and 1.8 A resolution at 293 and 100 K, respectively. It represents the first known structure for a polysaccharidase with this specificity and for a member of glycoside hydrolase family 53 (GH-53). The enzyme folds into a (beta/alpha)(8) barrel with the active site cleft located at the C-terminal side of the barrel consistent with the classification of GH-53 in clan GH-A, a superfamily of enzymes with common fold and catalytic machinery but diverse specificities. Putative substrate-enzyme interactions were elucidated by modeling of beta-1,4-linked galactobioses into the possible substrate binding subsites. The structure and modeling studies identified five potential subsites for the binding of galactans, of which one is a pocket suited for accommodating the arabinan side chain in arabinogalactan, one of the natural substrates. A comparison with the substrate binding grooves of other Clan GH-A enzymes suggests that shape complementarity is crucial in determining the specificity of polysaccharidases.

The introduction of several kinds of genes into the yeast chromosome is a powerful tool in many fields from fundamental study to industrial application. Here, we describe a general strategy for one-step gene integration and a marker recycling method. Forty base pairs of a short sequence derived from a region adjacent to the HIS3 locus were placed between cell surface displaying beta-glucosidase (BGL) and URA3 marker genes. HIS3 deletion and BGL-URA3 fragment integration were achieved via a PCR fragment consisting of the BGL-URA3 fragment attached to homology sequences flanked by the HIS3 targeting locus. The obtained his3::URA3 disruptants were plated on a 5-FOA plate to select for the URA3 deletion due to repeated sequences at both sides of URA3 gene. In all selected colonies, BGL genes were integrated at the targeted HIS3 locus and URA3 was completely deleted. In addition, introduced BGL was efficiently expressed, and the transformants fermented cellobiose to ethanol effectively. As our strategy creates next transformation markers continuously together with gene integration, this method can serve as a simple and powerful tool for multiple genetic manipulations in yeast engineering.

To determine if the attached cells formed in Myosin II-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae result from deficient chitinase 1 (CTS1) expression, the activity of chitinase 1 was assayed. Secretion of this enzyme was not prevented by a MYO1 gene deficiency, and soluble and cell wall-associated Cts1p activity were increased approximately 5-fold and 20-fold, respectively, in these cells. The increase in soluble activity was correlated with an increase in enzyme levels. Likewise, intracellular chitinase activity was increased approximately 22-fold, and the chitin content of cell walls was elevated 2-fold. These data suggest that the origin of myo1-associated phenotypes is not due to deficient chitinase expression and may instead be due to a deregulation of cell wall metabolism in these cells.

Chitinases hydrolyse the beta(1,4)-glycosidic bonds of chitin, an essential fungal cell wall component. Genetic data on a subclass of fungal family 18 chitinases have suggested a role in cell wall morphology. Specific inhibitors of these enzymes would be useful as tools to study their role in cell wall morphogenesis and could possess antifungal properties. Here, we describe the crystallographic structure of a fungal "plant-type" family 18 chitinase, that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTS1. The enzyme is active against 4-methylumbelliferyl chitooligosaccharides and displays an unusually low pH optimum for activity. A library screen against ScCTS1 yielded hits with Ki 's as low as 3.2 microM. Crystal structures of ScCTS1 in complex with inhibitors from three series reveal striking mimicry of carbohydrate substrate by small aromatic moieties and a pocket that could be further exploited in optimization of these inhibitors.

The aim of this study was to develop and characterize antigens for the diagnosis of aspergillosis. Nine strains of  Aspergillus  species  Aspergillus fumigatus ,  Aspergillus flavus , and  Aspergillus niger  were grown in Sabouraud and Smith broth to produce exoantigens. The antigens were tested by immunodiffusion against sera from patients with aspergillosis and other systemic mycoses. The protein fraction of the antigens was detected by SDS-PAGE; Western blot and representative bands were assessed by mass spectrometry coupled to a nano Acquity UltraPerformance LC and analyzed by the Mascot search engine. Concurrently, all sera were tested with Platelia Aspergillus EIA. The most reactive antigens to sera from patients infected by A. fumigatus were produced by A. fumigatus MG2 Sabouraud and pooled A. fumigatus Sabouraud samples, both with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100% and 97%, respectively. Aspergillus niger and A. flavus antigens were reactive against A. niger and A. flavus sera, each one with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Two proteins, probably responsible for antigenic activity, β-glucosidase in A. fumigatus and α-amylase in A. niger were attained. The commercial kit had a specificity of 22%, sensitivity of 100%, positive predictive value of 48%, and negative predictive value of 100%. The antigens produced showed high sensitivity and specificity and can be exploited for diagnostics of aspergilloma. 
1379885	19920406	Carbohydr._Res.	D016428 	Action patterns of amylolytic enzymes as determined by the [1-14C]malto-oligosaccharide mapping method.	A valuable technique for oligosaccharide mapping, utilizing radioactive malto-oligosaccharides, multiple-ascent p.c., and radioautography, has been developed for identifying the action patterns of the glucoamylase isozymes, alpha-amylases, beta-amylase, glucosyltransferase, and glucanosyltransferase. The glucoamylase isozymes act by multi-chain mechanisms on malto-oligosaccharides and most likely on starch and glycogen. The alpha-amylases act endo-wise and randomly hydrolyze alpha-(1----4)- but not alpha-(1----6)-glucosidic bonds. These amylases may act by single-chain and/or multi-chain mechanisms, depending on the number of hydrolytic attacks per single encounter of the enzyme and the substrate. The beta-amylases hydrolyze malto-oligosaccharides by a multi-chain mechanism. A fungal glucosyltransferase from Aspergillus niger transfers glucose units by a single-chain mechanism from maltose to glucosyl acceptors to yield new gluco-oligosaccharides with alpha-(1----4) and alpha-(1----6) linkages. A novel type of transferase isolated from Bacillus subtilis acts by a multi-chain mechanism and transfers segments of 2 to 5 glucose residues from malto-oligosaccharides to acceptor co-substrates. An alpha-amylase from the same organism removes maltotriose units from the non-reducing ends of oligosaccharides by a multi-chain mechanism. 
22151976	20111214	BMC_Microbiol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of a pectin lyase gene from Colletotrichum lindemuthianum and comparative phylogenetic/structural analyses with genes from phytopathogenic and saprophytic/opportunistic microorganisms.	Microorganisms produce cell-wall-degrading enzymes as part of their strategies for plant invasion/nutrition. Among these, pectin lyases (PNLs) catalyze the depolymerization of esterified pectin by a β-elimination mechanism. PNLs are grouped together with pectate lyases (PL) in Family 1 of the polysaccharide lyases, as they share a conserved structure in a parallel β-helix. The best-characterized fungal pectin lyases are obtained from saprophytic/opportunistic fungi in the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium and from some pathogens such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.The organism used in the present study, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, is a phytopathogenic fungus that can be subdivided into different physiological races with different capacities to infect its host, Phaseolus vulgaris. These include the non-pathogenic and pathogenic strains known as races 0 and 1472, respectively. Here we report the isolation and sequence analysis of the Clpnl2 gene, which encodes the pectin lyase 2 of C. lindemuthianum, and its expression in pathogenic and non-pathogenic races of C. lindemuthianum grown on different carbon sources. In addition, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of Clpnl2 based on reported sequences of PNLs from other sources and compared the three-dimensional structure of Clpnl2, as predicted by homology modeling, with those of other organisms. Both analyses revealed an early separation of bacterial pectin lyases from those found in fungi and oomycetes. Furthermore, two groups could be distinguished among the enzymes from fungi and oomycetes: one comprising enzymes from mostly saprophytic/opportunistic fungi and the other formed mainly by enzymes from pathogenic fungi and oomycetes. Clpnl2 was found in the latter group and was grouped together with the pectin lyase from C. gloeosporioides. The Clpnl2 gene of C. lindemuthianum shares the characteristic elements of genes coding for pectin lyases. A time-course analysis revealed significant differences between the two fungal races in terms of the expression of Clpnl2 encoding for pectin lyase 2. According to the results, pectin lyases from bacteria and fungi separated early during evolution. Likewise, the enzymes from fungi and oomycetes diverged in accordance with their differing lifestyles. It is possible that the diversity and nature of the assimilatory carbon substrates processed by these organisms played a determinant role in this phenomenon. 
24202099	20131109	Planta	D016428 	Cellulose and pectin localization in roots of mycorrhizalAllium porrum: labelling continuity between host cell wall and interfacial material.	Two different types of contacts (or interfaces) exist between the plant host and the fungus during the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, depending on whether the fungus is intercellular or intracellular. In the first case, the walls of the partners are in contact, while in the second case the fungal wall is separated from the host cytoplasm by the invaginated host plasmamembrane and by an interfacial material. In order to verify the origin of the interfacial material, affinity techniques which allow identification in situ of cell-wall components, were used. Cellobiohydrolase (CBH I) that binds to cellulose and a monoclonal antibody (JIM 5) that reacts with pectic components were tested on roots ofAllium porrum L. (leek) colonized byGlomus versiforme (Karst.) Berch. Both probes gave a labelling specific for the host cell wall, but each probe labelled over specific and distinct areas. The CBH I-colloidal gold complex heavily labelled the thick epidermal cell walls, whereas JIM 5 only labelled this area weakly. Labelling of the hypodermis was mostly on intercellular material after treatment with JIM 5 and only on the wall when CBH I was used. Suberin bands found on the radial walls were never labelled. Cortical cells were mostly labelled on the middle lamella with JIM 5 and on the wall with CBH I. Gold granules from the two probes were found in interfacial material both near the point where the fungus enters the cell and around the thin hyphae penetrating deep into the cell. The ultrastructural observations demonstrate that cellulose and pectic components have different but complementary distributions in the walls of root cells involved in the mycorrhizal symbiosis. These components show a similar distribution in the interfacial material laid down around the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus indicating that the interfacial material is of host origin.

1504587	19920101	Biotechnology	D016428 D016454 	Extracellular enzymes: gene regulation and structure function relationship studies.	The first conclusion that one could make from the literature covered in this section is that most single mutations in subtilisin BPN'n do not cause major structural alterations. Even multiple mutations, though they may cause local minor perturbations at each of the altered sites, do not affect the overall structure to a large degree. Bott and Ultsch (1986) observed that the subtilisin BPN' structure is very tolerant of single mutations, and this tolerance may have been necessary for survival of the enzyme during the course of evolution. This structural tolerance is not all that surprising if one considers that the structure of subtilisin Carlsberg is very similar to that of subtilisin BPN' while the protein sequences differ by 31%. A superposition of the 274 alpha-carbon atoms of the two enzymes gives a root mean square (rms) deviation of 0.053 nm, a value indicating significant structural similarity (McPhalen and James 1988). Furthermore, the fungal enzyme proteinase K, which is classified as part of the subtilisin family, has approximately 38-40% sequence homology with bacilli subtilisins, particularly in the catalytic site and substrate-binding regions (Betzel et al. 1988). For these sequence-homology regions there is also a structural similarity indicated by a least squares superposition of alpha-carbons giving an rms deviation of 0.11 nm (Betzel et al. 1988). Thermitase, also a member of the subtilisin family, has 47% sequence homology to subtilisin BPN' (Gros et al. 1989). If the best 203 alpha-carbon atoms are superposed, then an rms deviation of 0.05 nm is obtained (Gros et al. 1989). Apparently a significant amount of sequence variation still allows for overall structural similarities in the subtilisin family of enzymes. Though the overall structure of subtilisin is not easily perturbed by single or even multiple mutations, it is clear from the evidence reviewed here that single mutations can lead to very significant effects on the catalytic efficiency, substrate preference, and stability of the enzyme. Analyzing the structural alterations in subtilisin mutants will lead to an understanding of the molecular effects of the mutations at the atomic level. This understanding enables investigators to model and predict the effects of other substitutions, and allows them to focus their efforts on those mutants that are most likely to have the desired properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

A very simple and sensitive procedure for the determination of the activity of highly purified endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from the microscopic fungus Trichoderma reesei using 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside has been developed. The HPLC study has shown that this substrate is cleaved by endo-1,4-beta-glucanase to form predominantly free 4-methylumbelliferone, Km and kcat being 1.25 mM and 7.9 s-1, respectively (30 degrees C, pH 5.0). The possibility of continuous photometric determination of the enzyme using the difference absorptivity coefficient of 1600 M-1 cm-1 at 350 nm has been demonstrated. 
23622347	20130430	Biotechnol_Biofuels	D016428 	Enhancement of fermentable sugar yields by α-xylosidase supplementation of commercial cellulases.	Although α-linked xylose is a major constituent of the hemicelluloses of land plants, few secreted α-xylosidases have been described from fungi or bacteria. AxlA of Aspergillus niger is a secreted α-xylosidase that was earlier shown to promote the release of free glucose (Glc) and xylose (Xyl) from substrates containing α-linked xylose, including isoprimeverose (IP), the heptasaccharide subunit of pea xyloglucan (XG), and tamarind XG. The utility of AxlA for enhancing release of free Glc and Xyl in combination with commercial enzyme cocktails from dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants was examined. Without AxlA supplementation, a mixture of CTec2 and HTec2 (both of which are derived from T. reesei) did not release significant levels of Glc from pea XG or tamarind XG. This is consistent with their lack of detectable α-xylosidase activity using model substrates. On alkaline hydrogen peroxide-pretreated corn stover, supplementation of CTec2/HTec2 (at a loading of 2.5 mg/g glucan) with AxlA (at a loading of 8 mg/g glucan) increased Glc yields from 82% to 88% of the total available Glc and increased Xyl yields from 55% to 60%. AxlA supplementation also improved Glc yields from corn stover treated with the commercial cellulase Accellerase 1000. The AxlA enhancement was not a general protein effect because bovine serum albumin or bovine gamma-globulin at similar concentrations did not enhance Glc yields from corn stover in response to CTec2/HTec2. Supplementation of CTec2/HTec2 with AxlA did not enhance Glc release from pretreated green or etiolated pea tissue. However, AxlA did enhance Glc and Xyl yields compared to CTec2/HTec2 alone from another dicotyledonous herbaceous plant, Chenopodium album (lamb's quarters). Supplementation of commercial cellulase cocktails with AxlA enhances yields of Glc and Xyl from some biomass substrates under some conditions, and may prove useful in industrial lignocellulose conversion.

The ethylene biosynthesis-inducing endoxylanase (EIX) from xylan-induced cultures of the fungus, Trichoderma viride, was purified to near homogeneity and compared with the EIX isolated from Cellulysin. Both enzymes migrate as 9.2 kilodalton proteins during gel filtration chromatography under nondenaturing conditions, but the mature polypeptide migrates as a 22 kilodalton band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amino acid composition of the 22 kilodalton polypeptide is enriched by Gly, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Tyr, but depleted in Ala, Glx, Leu, and Lys. Both proteins lack sulfur-containing amino acids. The protein is glycosylated, and inhibition of EIX synthesis by tunicamycin suggests that at least some of the sugar moieties are linked to asparagine residues. EIX appears to be synthesized initially as a 25 kilodalton precursor protein that is processed to 22 kilodalton during secretion. 
16661404	19800801	Plant_Physiol.	D016428 	Glycosidic Enzyme Activity in Pea Tissue and Pea-Fusarium solani Interactions.	Membrane barriers which prevent direct contact between Fusarium solani and pea endocarp tissue prevent fungal spores from inducing phytoalexin production. Conversely, preinduced host resistance responses are not readily transported from the plant across the membrane barrier to Fusarium macroconidia.Crude enzyme extracts from pea endocarp tissues partially degrade Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli cell walls. Activities of the glycosidic enzymes, chitinase, beta-1,3-glucanase, chitosanase, beta-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-D-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, beta-D-glucosidase, alpha-D-glucosidase, and alpha-D-mannosidase, were detected in pea endocarp tissue. If pods are challenged with Fusarium spores or chitosan, the chitinase activity of the infected tissue remains higher than water-treated pods 0.5 to 6 hours after treatment. The beta-1,3-glucanase activity increases within 6 hours in both inoculated and control tissue. Chitosanase activity was lower in tissue treated with Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi, f. sp. phaseoli or chitosan than in water-treated control tissue. Thus, the pea tissue contains glycosidic enzymes with the potential to degrade the major compounds of the Fusarium cell walls.

In this study, a novel generic feedstock production strategy based on solid-state fermentation (SSF) has been developed and applied to the fermentative production of succinic acid. Wheat was fractionated into bran, gluten and gluten-free flour by milling and gluten extraction processes. The bran, which would normally be a waste product of the wheat milling industry, was used to produce glucoamylase and protease enzymes via SSF using Aspergillus awamori and Aspergillus oryzae, respectively. The resulting solutions were separately utilised for the hydrolysis of gluten-free flour and gluten to generate a glucose-rich stream of over 140gl(-1) glucose and a nitrogen-rich stream of more than 3.5gl(-1) free amino nitrogen. A microbial feedstock consisting of these two streams contained all the essential nutrients required for succinic acid fermentations using Actinobacillus succinogenes. In a fermentation using only the combined hydrolysate streams, around 22gl(-1) succinic acid was produced. The addition of MgCO3 into the wheat-derived medium improved the succinic acid production further to more than 64gl(-1). These results demonstrate the SSF-based strategy is a successful approach for the production of a generic feedstock from wheat, and that this feedstock can be efficiently utilised for succinic acid production.

Pleurotus ostreatus and Pleurotus sajor-caju were studied for their ability to produce laccase and carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) enzymes on different agricultural wastes under solid state fermentation. The spawns of P. ostreatus and P. sajor-caju were inoculated on different agricultural wastes including viticulture wastes, wheat straw, paddy straw, sesame straw, sawdust as well as the mixtures of these wastes with wheat bran. The carbon and nitrogen contents of substrates containing bran were the highest. The laccase activities of P. ostreatus and P. sajor-caju reached the highest values on the day 10 of mycelial growth. This enzyme activity was higher on the substrates containing bran which had high nitrogen and low C/N ratio than the other tested substrates with no bran. The CMCase activities of P. sajor-caju and P. ostreatus had two peaks on the 5th day of mycelial growth and after first flash. P. ostreatus and P. sajor-caju grown on substrates containing wheat bran had higher biological efficiencies and total yields as well as higher CMCase and laccase activities.

D016428 D013487 	Overproduction of the GAL1 or GAL3 protein causes galactose-independent activation of the GAL4 protein: evidence for a new model of induction for the yeast GAL/MEL regulon.	The transcriptional activation function of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 protein is modulated by the GAL80 and GAL3 proteins. In the absence of galactose, GAL80 inhibits the function of GAL4, presumably by direct binding to the GAL4 protein. The presence of galactose triggers the relief of the GAL80 block. The key to this relief is the GAL3 protein. How GAL3 and galactose activate GAL4 is not understood, but the long-standing notion has been that a galactose derivative formed by catalytic activity of GAL3 is the inducer that interacts with GAL80 or the GAL80-GAL4 complex. Here we report that overproduction of the GAL3 protein causes constitutive expression of GAL/MEL genes in the absence of exogenous galactose. Overproduction of the GAL1 protein (galactokinase) also causes constitutivity, consistent with the observations that GAL1 is strikingly similar in amino acid sequence to GAL3 and has GAL3-like induction activity. Cells lacking the GAL10-encoded UDP-galactose-UDP-glucose epimerase retained the constitutivity response to overproduction of GAL3, making it unlikely that constitutivity is due to endogenously produced galactose. A galactose-independent mechanism of constitutivity is further indicated by the inducing properties of two newly created galactokinaseless alleles of GAL1. On the basis of these data, we propose a new model for galactose-induced activation of the GAL4 protein. This model invokes galactose-activation of the GAL3 and GAL1 proteins which in turn elicit an alteration of the GAL80-GAL4 complex to activate GAL4. This model is consistent with all the known features of the system and has important implications for manipulating GAL4-dependent transcriptional activation in vitro.

The production of cellulolytic enzymes by the fungus Aspergillus phoenicis was investigated. Grape waste from the winemaking industry was chosen as the growth substrate among several agro-industrial byproducts. A 2 x 2 central composite design was performed, utilizing the amount of grape waste and peptone as independent variables. The fungus was cultivated in submerged fermentation at 30 degrees C and 120 rpm for 120 h, and the activities of total cellulases, endoglucanases, and beta-glucosidases were measured. Total cellulases were positively influenced by the linear increase of peptone concentration and decrease at axial concentrations of grape waste and peptone. Maximum activity of endoglucanase was observed by a linear increase of both grape waste and peptone concentrations. Concentrations of grape waste between 5 and 15 g/L had a positive effect on the production of beta-glucosidase; peptone had no significant effects. The optimum production of the three cellulolytic activities was observed at values near the central point. A. phoenicis has the potential for the production of cellulases utilizing grape waste as the growth substrate. 
7957921	19941107	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Troponin T is capable of binding dystrophin via a leucine zipper.	Using genetic and physical assays for protein-protein interactions, we identified a fast isoform of troponin T that binds to dystrophin. Troponin T specifically bound to the first of two highly conserved leucine zipper motifs in the carboxy terminus of dystrophin [1,2]. Single amino acid changes in the zipper predicted to disrupt alpha-helix formation or cause steric hindrance abolished this binding. These data support the hypothesis that dystrophin couples the contractile apparatus to the sarcolemma and indicate that leucine zipper mediated protein-protein interactions are functionally important in the cytoskeleton as well as the nucleus. 
17917893	20071006	DNA_Seq.	D016428 D013485 	Nucleotide sequence of a G/11 family xylanase encoding gene in Scytalidium thermophilum.	The nucleotide sequence of the xylanase encoding gene in Scytalidium thermophilum Af101-3 was determined. The gene encodes a family G/11 xylanase, and the coding region is interrupted by a 72 bp intron. Transcription of the gene was investigated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Transcription of the gene was not affected by the presence of 2% glucose in the medium. Xylanase production in S. thermophilum Af101-3 was also affected by concentration of glucose in the medium (modified Czapek's supplemented with 2% corn cob powder and 0.1% glucose). Therefore, xylanase expression in this fungus may not be regulated by the carbon source in the medium.

In the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei, endoglucanase III (EGIII) is coordinately expressed with other cellulases during growth on cellulose, its derivatives, and L-sorbose. To elucidate EGIII induction mechanism, we cloned and sequenced the upstream region of egl3 encoding EGIII. Two GGCTAA motifs, a putative binding site for ACEII and xylanase regulator Xyr1, were found on the template strand of the egl3 upstream region. Deletion analysis of the egl3 upstream region using the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter system revealed that removal of regions containing the GGCTAA motifs and the region between -1,045 and -1,002 bp containing GGCTAT motif severely affected GUS inducibility. Furthermore, mutation of the two GGCTAA motifs and the GGCTAT motif of this region led to a significant decrease in GUS activity. These data indicate that both GGCTAA and GGCTAT are key motifs for egl3 expression, and that egl3 induction may also be controlled by Xyr1. This hypothesis was supported by in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay, in which heterologously expressed Xyr1 specifically bound not only GGCTAA but also GGCTAT motif. 
2500148	19890707	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 	Expression of cloned Saccharomyces diastaticus glucoamylase under natural and inducible promoters.	Any one of three homologous genes - STA1, STA2 and STA3 - encoding glucoamylase isozymes I, II and III respectively, allows the Saccharomyces species to utilize starch as a sole carbon source. We show in this paper that glucoamylase II production can be increased 4-fold over the level produced by STA2 strains, by using a two-step fermentation and a yeast strain transformed with a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the STA2 gene. The accumulation of anomalous STA2 mRNA species, mainly differing at their 5' ends, and saturation of step(s) in the secretory pathway appear to be among the major factors limiting glucoamylase expression in synthetic media.

We present here the first experimental evidence for bound substrate in the active site of a rhamnogalacturonan lyase belonging to family 4 of polysaccharide lyases, Aspergillus aculeatus rhamnogalacturonan lyase (RGL4). RGL4 is involved in the degradation of rhamnogalacturonan-I, an important pectic plant cell wall polysaccharide. Based on the previously determined wild-type structure, enzyme variants RGL4_H210A and RGL4_K150A have been produced and characterized both kinetically and structurally, showing that His210 and Lys150 are key active-site residues. Crystals of the RGL4_K150A variant soaked with a rhamnogalacturonan digest gave a clear picture of substrate bound in the -3/+3 subsites. The crystallographic and kinetic studies on RGL4, and structural and sequence comparison to other enzymes in the same and other PL families, enable us to propose a detailed reaction mechanism for the β-elimination on [-,2)-α-l-rhamno-(1,4)-α-d-galacturonic acid-(1,-]. The mechanism differs significantly from the one established for pectate lyases, in which most often calcium ions are engaged in catalysis. 
9728689	19980905	Int._J._Food_Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Effect of water activity on hydrolytic enzyme production by Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium proliferatum during colonisation of maize.	The effect of different water availabilities (water activity, aw; 0.98-0.93) and time (up to 15 days) on the production of seven hydrolytic enzymes by strains of F. moniliforme and F. proliferatum during early colonisation of gamma-irradiated living maize grain were examined in this study. Both the total activity (micromol 4-nitrophenol min(-1) g(-1) maize) and specific activity (nmol 4-nitrophenol min(-1) microg(-1) protein) were quantified using chromogenic p-nitrophenyl substrates. The dominant three enzymes produced by the fungi on whole colonised maize kernels were alpha-D-galactosidase, beta-D-glucosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. The other four enzymes were all produced in much lower total amounts and in terms of specific activity (beta-D-fucosidase, alpha-D-mannosidase, beta-D-xylosidase and N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminidase), similar to that in uncolonised control maize grain. There were significant increases in the total production of the three predominant enzymes between 3-15 days colonisation, and between 3-6 days in terms of specific activity when compared to untreated controls. The total and specific activity of the alpha-D-galactosidase, beta-D-glucosidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, were maximum at 0.98 aw with significantly less being produced at 0.95 and 0.93 aw, with the exception of the total activity of alpha-D-galactosidase which was similar at both 0.95 and 0.93 aw. Single factors (time, aw, and inoculation treatment), two- and three- way interactions were all statistically significant for the three dominant enzymes produced except for specific activity of beta-D-glucosidase (two and three-way interactions) and for total activity of alpha-D-galactosidase in the time x aw treatment. This study suggests that these hydrolytic enzymes may play an important role in enabling these important fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp. to rapidly infect living maize grain over a wide aw range.

The actinomycetes Streptomyces violaceusniger showed strong antagonistic activity against various tested wood rotting fungi. An extracellular chitinase, produced by antagonistic S. violaceusniger MTCC 3959, was purified as follows: ammonium sulfate precipitation, chitin affinity and chromatographic separation of Q Sepharose. The molecular mass of the purified chitinase was estimated as 56.5 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Chitinase was optimally active at pH of 5.0 and 50 °C. It retained almost 100% activity at pH 5.0 and also had high thermal tolerance at 50 °C. Enzyme activity was inhibited by Hg(2+) and Ag(+) cations, but was neither substantially inhibited by K(+) cation nor by chelating agent EDTA. The apparent Km and Vmax at 37 °C were 0.1426 mM and 6.6 U/mg, respectively using pNP-(GlcNAc)2 as substrate. The 56.5 kDa chitinase of strain MTCC 3959 represented an exo-type activity. The purified chitinase was further identified by MALDI-TOF. The results of peptide mass fingerprinting showed that 10 tryptic peptides of the chitinase were identical to the chitinase C from Streptomyces albus J1074 (GenBank Accession No. gi|239982330). The sequence of N-terminal amino acid (AA) of the chitinase was determined to be G-D-G-T-G-P-G-P-G-P.

Penicillium ochrochloron Biourge, which was isolated from rotten sweet potato, can produce plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) with high viscosity reducing capability for ethanol production using fresh sweet potato tubers as feedstock. The enzyme preparation was characterized by a broad enzyme spectrum including 13 kinds of enzymes with the activity to hydrolyze cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, starch, and protein. The maximum viscosity-reducing capability was observed when the enzyme preparation was obtained after 5 days of fermentation using 20 g/L corncob as a sole carbon source, 4.5 g/L NH4 NO3 as a sole nitrogen source, and an initial medium pH of 6.5. The sweet potato mash treated with the enzyme preparation exhibited much higher fermentation efficiency (92.58%) compared with commercial cellulase (88.06%) and control (83.5%). The enzyme production was then scaled up to 0.5, 5, and 100 L, and the viscosity-reducing rates were found to be 85%, 90%, and 91%, respectively. Thus, P. ochrochloron Biourge displays potential viscosity-reducing capability for ethanol production.  
19696104	20090822	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Genome-wide analysis of maltose utilization and regulation in aspergilli.	Maltose utilization and regulation in aspergilli is of great importance for cellular physiology and industrial fermentation processes. In Aspergillus oryzae, maltose utilization requires a functional MAL locus, composed of three genes: MALR encoding a regulatory protein, MALT encoding maltose permease and MALS encoding maltase. Through a comparative genome and transcriptome analysis we show that the MAL regulon system is active in A. oryzae while it is not present in Aspergillus niger. In order to utilize maltose, A. niger requires a different regulatory system that involves the AmyR regulator for glucoamylase (glaA) induction. Analysis of reporter metabolites and subnetworks illustrates the major route of maltose transport and metabolism in A. oryzae. This demonstrates that overall metabolic responses of A. oryzae occur in terms of genes, enzymes and metabolites when the carbon source is altered. Although the knowledge of maltose transport and metabolism is far from being complete in Aspergillus spp., our study not only helps to understand the sugar preference in industrial fermentation processes, but also indicates how maltose affects gene expression and overall metabolism.

The methylotrophic yeast, Canadida boidinii, was investigated as an expression host for secretory enzyme production. The cDNA of Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase was placed under the C. boidinii alcohol oxidase (AODl) promoter. A transformant integrated with a single-copy expression cassette to the chromosome produced glucoamylase into the medium to a high amount when the cells were grown on methanol or methanol plus glycerol as (a) carbon source(s). The transformant C. boidinii cells were grown up to ca. 95 g dry cell weight/liter medium, and the concentration of glucoamylase in the medium reached 3.4 g/liter. This showed that the signal sequence from Rhizopus glucoamylase functioned very efficiently in C. boidinii. Next, secreted glucoamylase from C. boidinii was purified and compared with the enzyme produced in S. cerevisiae. The enzyme produced in C. boidinii was found to have higher molecular weight than that produced in S. cerevisiae, which was due to the difference of the N-linked glycosylated sugar structure of the produced proteins.

D016428 D013485 	Clostridium beijerinckii cells expressing Neocallimastix patriciarum glycoside hydrolases show enhanced lichenan utilization and solvent production.	Growth and the production of acetone, butanol, and ethanol by Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 on several polysaccharides and sugars were analyzed. On crystalline cellulose, growth and solvent production were observed only when a mixture of fungal cellulases was added to the medium. On lichenan growth and solvent production occurred, but this polymer was only partially utilized. To increase utilization of these polymers and subsequent solvent production, the genes for two new glycoside hydrolases, celA and celD from the fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum, were cloned separately into C. beijerinckii. To do this, a secretion vector based on the pMTL500E shuttle vector and containing the promoter and signal sequence coding region of the Clostridium saccharobutylicum NCP262 eglA gene was constructed and fused either to the celA gene or the celD gene. Stable C. beijerinckii transformants were obtained with the resulting plasmids, pWUR3 (celA) and pWUR4 (celD). The recombinant strains showed clear halos on agar plates containing carboxymethyl cellulose upon staining with Congo red. In addition, their culture supernatants had significant endoglucanase activities (123 U/mg of protein for transformants harboring celA and 78 U/mg of protein for transformants harboring celD). Although C. beijerinckii harboring either celA or celD was not able to grow, separately or in mixed culture, on carboxymethyl cellulose or microcrystalline cellulose, both transformants showed a significant increase in solvent production during growth on lichenan and more extensive degradation of this polymer than that exhibited by the wild-type strain.

The pseudo-oligosaccharides, validamycins, showed potent inhibitory activity against trehalase of Rhizoctonia solani while no significant inhibition was exhibited against cellulase, pectinase, chitinase, alpha-amylase, alpha- and beta-glucosidases. In particular, validoxylamine A strongly inhibited trehalase in a competitive manner with a Ki value of 1.9 X 10(-9) M. The uptake of the antibiotic into the cell and the amount of the intracellular trehalose were investigated by incubating the washed mycelia of R. solani with validamycins. It was found that validamycin A is transported into the cell and hydrolyzed therein by a beta-glucosidase yielding validoxylamine A with greater inhibitory activity. Also validamycin A containing beta-D-glucosyl residue is more favorably taken up into the cell than validamycin D containing alpha-D-glucosyl residue or their common aglycone, validoxylamine A. In addition, validamycin A suppressed the in vivo degradation of the intracellular trehalose at very low concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml.

D016428 	Production of amylases from rice by solid-state fermentation in a gas-solid spouted-Bed bioreactor 	A gas-solid spouted-bed bioreactor was developed to produce amylases from rice in solid-state fermentation by Aspergillus oryzae. The spouted-bed bioreactor was developed to overcome many of the problems inherent to large-scale solid-state fermentation, including mass- and heat-transfer limitations in the conventional tray reactors and solids-handling difficulties seen in packed-bed bioreactors. The solid-state fermentation results from the tray-type reactor with surface aeration were poor because of mass- and heat-transfer problems. A packed-bed bioreactor with continuous aeration through the rice bed produced high protein and enzymes, but the fermented rice was difficult to remove and process due to the formation of large chunks of rice aggregates knitted together with fungal mycelia. Also, the fermentation was not uniform in the packed bed. The spouted-bed bioreactor with intermittent spouting with air achieved high production levels in both total protein and enzymes (alpha-amylase, beta-amylase, and glucoamylase) that were comparable to those found in the packed-bed bioreactor, but without the nonuniformity and solids-handling problems. However, continual spouting was found to be detrimental to this solid-state fermentation, possibly because of shear or impact damage to fungal mycelia during spouting. Increasing spouting frequency from 4-h intervals to 1-h intervals decreased protein and enzyme production. Other operating conditions critical to the fermentation include proper humidification to prevent drying of the substrate and control of reactor wall temperature to prevent excessive condensation, which would interfere with proper spouting. 
27428	19780101	Folia_Microbiol._(Praha)	D016428 	Some properties of an endo-1,4-beta-D-xylanase from the ligniperdous fungus Trametes hirsuta.	Some properties of purified endo-1,4-beta-D-xylanase (1,4-beta-D-xylan xylanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.8) from the ligniperdous fungus Trametes hirsuta were investigated. The enzyme was stable between pH 4.0 and 8.0 were optimum activity at pH 5.0--5.5. The temperature optimum was 50 degrees C and the enzyme was stable for up to 30 min at 45 degrees C; however, it was denatured at higher temperatures. The Km for 4-O-methylglucurono-D-xylan was 6.36.10(-3) equivalents of D-xylose per litre, the activation energy was 28 kJ mol-1. The molecular weight determined by means of gel chromatography was 22000--24000. The enzyme was activated by Ca2+ and inhibited by Ag+ and Hg2+. On the basis of the effect of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide. N-bromosuccinimide and N-acetylimidazole it may be assumed that trytophan and possibly tyrosine residues influence the enzyme catalysis. 
12387863	20021022	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 	Expression profiling of pectinolytic genes from Aspergillus niger.	The expression of 26 pectinolytic genes from Aspergillus niger was studied in a wild type strain and a CreA derepressed strain, under 16 different growth conditions, to obtain an expression profile for each gene. These expression profiles were then submitted to cluster analysis to identify subsets of genes with similar expression profiles. With the exception of the feruloyl esterase encoding genes, all genes were expressed in the presence of D-galacturonic acid, polygalacturonate, and/or sugar beet pectin. Despite this general observation five distinct groups of genes were identified. The major group consisted of 12 genes of which the corresponding enzymes act on the pectin backbone and for which the expression, in general, is higher after 8 and 24 h of incubation, than after 2 or 4 h. Two other groups of genes encoding pectin main chain acting enzymes were detected. Two additional groups contained genes encoding L-arabinose and D-galactose releasing enzymes, and ferulic acid releasing enzymes, respectively. The genes encoding beta-galactosidase and the L-arabinose releasing enzymes were not only expressed in the presence of D-galacturonic acid, but also in the presence of L-arabinose, suggesting that they are under the control of two regulatory systems. Similarly, the rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase encoding gene was not only expressed in the presence of D-galacturonic acid, polygalacturonate and sugar beet pectin, but also in the presence of L-rhamnose. The data presented provides indications for a general pectinolytic regulatory system responding to D-galacturonic acid or a metabolite derived from it. In addition, subsets of pectinolytic genes are expressed in response to the presence of L-arabinose, L-rhamnose or ferulic acid. 
24329860	20131217	Biotechnol._Appl._Biochem.	D016428 	Efficient production of fermentable sugars from oil palm empty fruit bunch by combined use of acid and whole cell culture-catalyzed hydrolyses.	Empty fruit bunch (EFB) of oil palm trees was converted to fermentable sugars by the combined use of dilute acids and whole fungal cell culture-catalyzed hydrolyses. EFB (5%, w/v) was hydrolyzed in the presence of 0.5% H2 SO4 and 0.2% H3 PO4 at 160 °C for 10 Min. The solid fraction was separated from the acid hydrolysate by filtration and subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis at 50 °C using the whole cell culture of Trichoderma reesei RUT-C30 (2%, w/v), which was prepared by cultivation at 30 °C for 7 days to reach its maximal cellulase activity. The combined hydrolyses of EFB gave a total sugar yield of 82.0%. When used as carbon sources for cultivating Escherichia coli in M9 medium at 37 °C, the combined EFB hydrolysates were shown to be more favorable or at least as good as pure glucose for cell growth in terms of the higher (1.1 times) optical density of E. coli cells. The by-products generated during the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis did not seem to obviously affect cell growth. The combined use of acid and whole cell culture hydrolyses might be a commercially promising method for pretreatment of lignocellulose to get fermentable sugars.  
19227841	20090221	Z._Naturforsch.,_C,_J._Biosci.	D016428 D013485 	Examination of Humicola lutea immobilized in sol-gel matrices: effective source of alpha-galactosidase.	Alpha-Galactosidase production by the fungus Humicola lutea 120-5 immobilized in a hybrid sol-gel matrix, consisting of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a precursor and a mixture of polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and polyvinylalcohol (PVA), was investigated under semicontinuous shake flask cultivation and compared to the enzyme secretion by free cells. The influence of the carrier weight on the alpha-galactosidase biosynthesis in repeated batch experiments was followed. Best results were obtained with 2 g of the sol-gel particles per culture flask using 144-h runs. The growth behaviour of the immobilized mycelium during both the growth and productive phases was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The presence of abundant mycelial growth of intact hyphae correlated with a 2-fold higher enzyme activity compared to free cells. The obtained biocatalyst retained a high level of enzyme titer exceeding the activity of free cells during four cycles of operation (24 days). This result is confirmed by the micrographs showing the retained viability of the growing vegetative cells due to the protective role of the carrier. 
23638383	20130503	PeerJ	D016428 	Cloning, expression and characterization of an ethanol tolerant GH3 β-glucosidase from Myceliophthora thermophila.	The β-glucosidase gene bgl3a from Myceliophthora thermophila, member of the fungal glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 3, was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The mature β-glucosidase gene, which results after the excision of one intron and the secreting signal peptide, was placed under the control of the strong alcohol oxidase promoter (AOX1) in the plasmid pPICZαC. The recombinant enzyme (90 kDa) was purified and characterized in order to evaluate its biotechnological potential. Recombinant P. pastoris efficiently secreted β-glucosidase into the medium and produced high level of enzymatic activity (41 U/ml) after 192 h of growth, under methanol induction. MtBgl3a was able to hydrolyze low molecular weight substrates and polysaccharides containing β-glucosidic residues. The K m was found to be 0.39 mM on p-β-NPG and 2.64 mM on cellobiose. Optimal pH and temperature for the p-β-NPG hydrolysis were 5.0 and 70 °C. The β-glucosidase exhibits a half life of 143 min at 60 °C. Kinetic parameters of inhibition were determined for D-glucose, D-xylose and D-gluconic acid, indicating tolerance of the enzyme for these sugars and oxidized products. The recombinant enzyme was stimulated by short chain alcohols and has been shown to efficiently synthesize methyl-D-glucoside in the presence of methanol due to its transglycosylation activity. The stability of MtBgl3a in ethanol was prominent, and it retained most of its original activity after we exposed it to 50% ethanol for 6 h. The high catalytic performance, good thermal stability and tolerance to elevated concentrations of ethanol, D-xylose and D-glucose qualify this enzyme for use in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production, as part of an efficient complete multi-enzyme cocktail. 
22783091	20120712	Mycobiology	D016428 	Optimal Media Conditions for the Detection of Extracellular Cellulase Activity in Ganoderma neo-japonicum.	To determine the optimal media conditions for the detection of the extracellular cellulase activity in Ganoderma neo-japonicum, we varied three media conditions: dye reagent, pH, and temperature. We evaluated the use of four dyes, Congo red, phenol red, remazol brilliant blue, and trypan blue. To observe the effect of pH on the chromogenic reaction, we tested media ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. To research the effect of temperature on the clear zone and the fungus growing zone, we tested temperatures ranging from 15 to 35℃. On the whole, the best protocol called for Ganoderma neo-japonicum transfer onto media containing Congo red with a pH of 7.0, followed by incubation at 25℃ for 5 days. Our results will be useful to researchers who study extracellular enzyme activity in Ganoderma neo-japonicum. 
20450015	20100511	Wiad_Parazytol	D004740 D016428 	[Characterization of proteo-, chitino- and lipolytic enzymes of parasitic fungus Conidiobolus coronatus].	The largest problem in limitation of insect pest population is increasing resistance of them to chemical pesticides. Alternative are entomopathogens, which regulate frequency of insect pests. Among them decisive role play entomopathogenic fungi, which possess the ability to active penetration through cuticle by mechanical pressure of invasive hypha and production of proteo-, chitino- (egzo- and endochitinases) as well as lipolytic enzymes, which provide nutrients for subsequent development of fungus. Entomopathogenic soil fungus Conidiobolus coronatus (Entomophtorales) is saprophyte fungus, which demonstrates a high efficiency in the paralysis of varied insects. Although leading investigations over mechanism of insect paralysis, we still do not know, what role fungal enzymes play in insect cuticle penetration. The main aim of research was establishment of optimal conditions for elastase, N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGase), chitobiosidase as well as lipase. Optimal reaction parameters were determined: volume of reaction mixture, volume of homogenate, working pH and the substrate concentration. Having on aim a possible use of C. coronatus in pest control, two ranges of temperatures were chosen: 20 degrees C--optimal temperature for the fungus growing and 30 degrees C--optimal temperature for the cultivation of the great wax moth larvae, Galleria mellonella, on which examinations were performed. Also kinetic constants Km and Vmax were determined. Activity of elastase and N-acetylglucosaminidase of C. coronatus was measured spectrophotometrically at 410 nm (towards N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-p-Nitroanilide) and 405 nm (towards 4-Nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide), respectively. The following optimal conditions of elastase activity were established: the volume of reaction mixture 0.5 ml, volume of homogenate 1 microl, temperature 30 degrees C, pH 8, substrate concentration 40 mM. Optimal conditions of NAGase assay: the volume of reaction mixture 0.5 ml, dose of homogenate 12.5 microl, temperature 30 degrees C, pH neutral and 6 mM substrate concentration. The activities of chitobiosidase and lipase were measured spectrofluorometrically (Ex=360 nm, Em=450 nm) towards 4-Methylumbelliferyl beta-D-N-N'-diacetylchitobioside and 4-Methylumbelliferyl oleate, respectively. Chitobiosidase showed the highest activity in dose of 30 microl in 1 ml volume of reaction mixture, at the temperature of 30 degrees C, pH 7 and substrate concentration equal to 2 mM. Lipase showed the highest catalytic activity in 1 ml volume of reaction mixture, in 30 degrees C but 50 microl of homogenate, pH 10 and 10 mM substrate concentration were needed. Higher activity investigated enzymes in 30 degrees C than 20 degrees C indicated that they can take part in pathogenesis. It was suggested that as first in perforation of coats of insects body elastase and lipase take part. Indicated of it, large thermoresistance of both enzymes (only 10.5% decrease of elastase activity at 20 degrees C and 9.4% decrease of lipase activity in comparison with maximal activity at 30 degrees C), alkalophilicity of both proteins (elastase shows the alkaline optimal pH equal to 8 at pH 9 preserves 97% activity, and at pH 10 94% activity, respectively while lipase prefers the pH 10 and at pH 8 and pH 9 enzyme keeps 57 and 60% activity, respectively) as well as lack of repression by suitable substrates. Sigmoid character of curve concerning pH influence on the activity of both enzymes, also indicates similarity between elastase and lipase. On minor part of NAGase and chitobiosidase of fungus C. coronatus in perforation of coats of host body showed high sensibility of both enzymes on hydrogen ions concentration: both enzymes prefer neutral pH, in pH 6 and 8 lose over 35% activity but subjection to substrate repression and 3-4-fold growth of activity followed only in 30 degrees C. In the course of work it was found, that rich medium (LB) stimulates growth of mycelium and production of fungal lipases. So far nobody managed to isolate chitinolytic or lipolytic enzymes from C. coronatus homogenate. The majority of fungal enzymes were isolated from post incubation filtrates. In the literature of the subject lack of data about C. coronatus NAGase, therefore in examinations also the trial of isolation NAGase from C. coronatus homogenate was undertaken. Activity of NAGase showed only first fraction, which did not separate with none of used columns. Disappointing results of purification on cation exchanger CM, weak anion exchanger DEAE, and strong anion exchanger Q were obtained as well as after fractionation tests with the use of Microcon microcolumns. In aim of NAGase molecular mass estimation, two zymograms were made with Triton X-100 and casein and with the use of fluorescent substrate 4-Methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide. Molecular mass of NAGase from C. coronatus was established on ca. 60 kDa. This is the first report describing molecular weight of NAGase from C. coronatus. Examined NAGase has different properties than known NAGases from other entomopathogenic fungi. Although its molecular weight is equal to the Metarhizium anisopliae NAGase, optimal pH for both NAGases are different: neutral in the case of C. coronatus NAGase versus acidic in the case of M. anisopliae NAGase. Knowledge of molecular mass of the C. coronatus NAGase should allow to find a new method of this enzyme isolation from C. coronatus homogenate. Thanks to developed methods of assaying activities of elastase, NAGase, chitobiosidase and lipase, real becomes the understanding of mechanism of insects paralysis through C. coronatus fungus. 
23712479	20130529	World_J._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Is an organic nitrogen source needed for cellulase production by Trichoderma reesei Rut-C30?	The effect of organic and inorganic nitrogen sources on Trichoderma reesei Rut-C30 cellulase production was investigated in submerged cultivations. Stirred tank bioreactors and shake flasks, with and without pH control, respectively, were employed. The experimental design involved the addition of individual organic nitrogen sources (soy peptone, glutamate, glycine and alanine) within a basal medium containing Avicel (i.e. micro crystalline cellulose) and ammonium sulphate. It was found that in the shake flask experiments, the highest cellulase activities (~0.1 ± 0.02 FPU ml(-1)) were obtained with media containing soy peptone (3-6 g l(-1)) and glutamate (3.6 g l(-1)). However, these improvements in the cellulase titers in the presence of the organic nitrogen sources appeared to be related to smaller changes in the pH of the medium. This was confirmed using stirred tank bioreactors with pH control. No significant differences were observed in the highest cellulase titers and the protein pattern (according to the SDS-PAGE) of supernatants from pH controlled stirred tank bioreactor cultivations, when different nitrogen sources were used in the medium. Here the cellulase activities (~1.0 ± 0.2 FPU ml(-1)) were also much greater (8-150 times) than in shake flask cultivation. Consequently, the addition of ammonium sulphate as sole nitrogen source to Avicel basal medium is recommended when performing cultivations in stirred tank bioreactors with strict pH controlled conditions. 
16205953	20051006	Oecologia	D016428 D013486 	Fungal community composition and metabolism under elevated CO(2) and O(3).	Atmospheric CO(2) and O(3) concentrations are increasing due to human activity and both trace gases have the potential to alter C cycling in forest ecosystems. Because soil microorganisms depend on plant litter as a source of energy for metabolism, changes in the amount or the biochemistry of plant litter produced under elevated CO(2) and O(3) could alter microbial community function and composition. Previously, we have observed that elevated CO(2) increased the microbial metabolism of cellulose and chitin, whereas elevated O(3) dampened this response. We hypothesized that this change in metabolism under CO(2) and O(3) enrichment would be accompanied by a concomitant change in fungal community composition. We tested our hypothesis at the free-air CO(2) and O(3) enrichment (FACE) experiment at Rhinelander, Wisconsin, in which Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, and Acer saccharum were grown under factorial CO(2) and O(3) treatments. We employed extracellular enzyme analysis to assay microbial metabolism, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to determine changes in microbial community composition, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) to analyze the fungal community composition. The activities of 1,4-beta-glucosidase (+37%) and 1,4,-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (+84%) were significantly increased under elevated CO(2), whereas 1,4-beta-glucosidase activity (-25%) was significantly suppressed by elevated O(3). There was no significant main effect of elevated CO(2) or O(3) on fungal relative abundance, as measured by PLFA. We identified 39 fungal taxonomic units from soil using DGGE, and found that O(3) enrichment significantly altered fungal community composition. We conclude that fungal metabolism is altered under elevated CO(2) and O(3), and that there was a concomitant change in fungal community composition under elevated O(3). Thus, changes in plant inputs to soil under elevated CO(2) and O(3) can propagate through the microbial food web to alter the cycling of C in soil.

The sequence of a partial cDNA clone corresponding to an mRNA induced in leaves of barley (Hordeum vulgare) by infection with fungal pathogens matched almost perfectly with that of a cDNA clone coding for beta-1,-3-glucanase isolated from the scutellum of barley. Western blot analysis of intercellular proteins from near-isogenic barley lines inoculated with the powdery mildew fungus (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei) showed a strong induction of glucanase in all inoculated lines but was most pronounced in two resistant lines. These data were confirmed by beta-1,3-glucanase assays. The barley cDNA was used as a hybridization probe to detect mRNAs in barley, wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (oryza sativus), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), which are induced by infection with the necrotrophic pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana. These results demonstrate that activation of beta-1,3-glucanase genes may be a general response of cereals to infection by fungal pathogens. 
9232877	19970701	Plant_Physiol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 	Differential effect of purified spruce chitinases and beta-1,3-glucanases on the activity of elicitors from ectomycorrhizal fungi.	Two chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) and two beta-1,3-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.39) were purified from the culture medium of spruce (Picea abines [L.] Karst.) cells to study their role in modifying elicitors, cell walls, growth, and hyphal morphology of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The 36-kD class I chitinase (isoelectric point [pl] 8.0) and the 28-kD chitinase (pl 8.7) decreased the activity of elicitor preparations from Hebeloma crustuliniforme (Bull. ex Fries.) Quél., Amanita muscaria (L.) Pers., and Suillus variegatus (Sw.: Fr.) O.K., as demonstrated by using the elicitor-induced extracellular alkalinization in spruce cells as a test system. In addition, chitinases released monomeric products from the walls of these ectomycorrhizal fungi. The beta-1,3-glucanases (35 kD, pl 3.7 and 3.9), in contrast, had little influence on the activity of the fungal elicitors and released only from walls of A. muscaria some polymeric products. Furthermore, chitinases alone and in combination with beta-1,3-glucanases had no effect on the growth and morphology of the hyphae. Thus, it is suggested that apoplastic chitinases in the root cortex destroy elicitors from the ectomycorrhizal fungi without damaging the fungus. By this mechanism the host plant could attenuate the elicitor signal and adjust its own defense reactions to a level allowing symbiotic interaction. 
21440435	20110329	Bioresour._Technol.	D016428 D013485 	Screening for distinct xylan degrading enzymes in complex shake flask fermentation supernatants.	The efficient degradation of complex xylans needs collaboration of many xylan degrading enzymes. Assays for xylan degrading activities based on reducing sugars or PNP substrates are not indicative for the presence of enzymes able to degrade complex xylans: They do not provide insight into the possible presence of xylanase-accessory enzymes within enzyme mixtures. A new screening method is described, by which specific xylan modifying enzymes can be detected. Fermentation supernatants of 78 different fungal soil isolates grown on wheat straw were analyzed by HPLC and MS. This strategy is powerful in recognizing xylanases, arabinoxylan hydrolases, acetyl xylan esterases and glucuronidases. No fungus produced all enzymes necessary to totally degrade the substrates tested. Some fungi produce high levels of xylanase active against linear xylan, but are unable to degrade complex xylans. Other fungi producing relative low levels of xylanase secrete many useful accessory enzyme component(s).

D016428 	Comparison of Parental and Transgenic Alfalfa Rhizosphere Bacterial Communities Using Biolog GN Metabolic Fingerprinting and Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Sequence-PCR (ERIC-PCR).	> Abstract Rhizosphere bacterial communities of parental and two transgenic alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) of isogenic background were compared based on metabolic fingerprinting using Biolog GN microplates and DNA fingerprinting of bacterial communities present in Biolog GN substrate wells by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-PCR (ERIC-PCR). The two transgenic alfalfa expressed either bacterial (Bacillus licheniformis) genes for alpha-amylase or fungal (Phanerochaete chrysosporium) genes for Mn-dependent lignin peroxidase (Austin S, Bingham ET, Matthews DE, Shahan MN, Will J, Burgess RR, Euphytica 85:381-393). Cluster analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) of the Biolog GN metabolic fingerprints indicated consistent differences in substrate utilization between the parental and lignin peroxidase transgenic alfalfa rhizosphere bacterial communities. Cluster analysis of ERIC-PCR fingerprints of the bacterial communities in Biolog GN substrate wells revealed consistent differences in the types of bacteria (substrate-specific populations) enriched from the rhizospheres of each alfalfa genotype. Comparison of ERIC-PCR fingerprints of bacterial strains obtained from substrate wells to substrate community ERIC-PCR fingerprints suggested that a limited number of populations were responsible for substrate oxidation in these wells. Results of this study suggest that transgenic plant genotype may affect rhizosphere microorganisms and that the methodology used in this study may prove a useful approach for the comparison of bacterial communities. 
1896470	19910915	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013486 	Identification of a fungal cutinase promoter that is inducible by a plant signal via a phosphorylated trans-acting factor.	Plant cutin monomers trigger, and glucose suppresses, the expression of the cutinase gene of pathogenic fungi. To identify the cutinase promoter region responsible for induction by the unique plant components, a promoter analysis was done with transformants. Plasmids were constructed that contained (i) the 5' flanking region of the cutinase gene or its deletion mutants from Fusarium solani pisi fused with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and (ii) a constitutive promoter fused with a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. Hygromycin-resistant transformants of F. solani pisi generated by electroporation were assayed for CAT activity inducible by cutin hydrolysate and for glucose repression of this induction. CAT was induced in a glucose-repressible manner when fused with a 360-base-pair (bp), or longer, segment of the 5' flanking region of the cutinase gene, and deletion of the next 135 bp abolished this induction. Gel retardation assays showed that a protein(s) in nuclear extract from the fungus bound to the 5' flanking region of cutinase gene, and this binding was also abolished when the same 135-bp segment was deleted. These results show that the -225 to -360 segment of the cutinase gene contains a cis-acting regulatory element that binds trans-acting factor(s) in the nuclei. Treatment of the nuclear extract with immobilized phosphatase abolished binding to the promoter, suggesting that binding required a phosphorylated form of the protein. With isolated nuclei, phosphorylation of a protein occurred only in the presence of both cutin monomer and the fungal protein factor. The presence of protein kinase inhibitor H7 during the preincubation of nuclei with the monomer and protein factor inhibited cutinase gene transcription. These results suggest that cutin monomer causes phosphorylation of a transcription factor that binds to the -225 to -360 segment of the cutinase gene and enhances transcription of this gene. 
1888892	19910111	Plant_Mol._Biol.	D016428 	High-level expression of a tobacco chitinase gene in Nicotiana sylvestris. Susceptibility of transgenic plants to Cercospora nicotianae infection.	Endochitinases (E.C.3.2.14, chitinase) are believed to be important in the biochemical defense of plants against chitin-containing fungal pathogens. We introduced a gene for class I (basic) tobacco chitinase regulated by Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S-RNA expression signals into Nicotiana sylvestris. The gene was expressed to give mature, enzymatically active chitinase targeted to the intracellular compartment of leaves. Most transformants accumulated extremely high levels of chitinase-up to 120-fold that of non-transformed plants in comparable tissues. Unexpectedly, some transformants exhibited chitinase levels lower than in non-transformed plants suggesting that the transgene inhibited expression of the homologous host gene. Progeny tests indicate this effect is not permanent. High levels of chitinase in transformants did not substantially increase resistance to the chitin-containing fungus Cercospora nicotiana, which causes Frog Eye disease. Therefore class I chitinase does not appear to be the limiting factor in the defense reaction to this pathogen. 
21798867	20110730	Glycobiology	D016428 D013486 	Structural elucidation of an α-1,2-mannosidase resistant oligosaccharide produced in Pichia pastoris.	The N-glycosylation pathway in Pichia pastoris has been humanized by the deletion of genes responsible for fungal-type glycosylation (high mannose) as well as the introduction of heterologous genes capable of forming human-like N-glycosylation. This results in a yeast host that is capable of expressing therapeutic glycoproteins. A thorough investigation was performed to examine whether glycoproteins expressed in glycoengineered P. pastoris strains may contain residual fungal-type high-mannose structures. In a pool of N-linked glycans enzymatically released by protein N-glycosidase from a reporter glycoprotein expressed in a developmental glycoengineered P. pastoris strain, an oligosaccharide with a mass consistent with a Hexose(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide was identified. When this structure was analyzed by a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), its retention time was identical to a Man(9)GlcNAc(2) standard. However, this Hexose(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide was found to be resistant to α-1,2-mannosidase as well as endomannosidase, which preferentially catabolizes endoplasmic reticulum oligosaccharides containing terminal α-linked glucose. To further characterize this oligosaccharide, we purified the Hexose(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide by HPLC and analyzed the structure by high-field one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) (1)H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy followed by structural elucidation by homonuclear and heteronuclear 1D and 2D (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The results of these experiments lead to the identification of an oligosaccharide α-Man-(1 → 2)-β-Man-(1 → 2)-β-Man-(1 → 2)-α-Man-(1 → 2) moiety as part of a tri-antennary structure. The difference in enzymatic reactivity can be attributed to multiple β-linkages on the α-1,3 arm of the Man(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide. 
16572843	20060401	Sheng_Wu_Gong_Cheng_Xue_Bao	D004740 D016428 D013485 	[High-level production of neutral endoglucanase 1 in Pichia pastoris].	The gene (eg1) encoding for novel endoglucanase 1 was cloned previously from Chinese straw mushroom Volvariella volvacea. EG1 has high thermal stability and optimal pH at neutral and shows great potential in textile and paper industry applications. To improve the expression level of EG1 in Pichia pastoris, the increasing copy number of clone, and its high cell density fermentation in 3.2L fermenter for its high-level expression were investigated in this work. By electro-transformation of pPICZalphaB-egl into GS115EG11 integrated with single copy of eg1 gene, A resistant transformant with 3.8 times higher level expression than GS115EG11 was screened from YPDSZ plate containing 2000 microg/mL of Zeocin. The effect of initial cell density, pH and methanol on its expression and biomass accumulation was evaluated in shaking culture. Optimal EG1 production was observed when initial cell density OD600 was 5.0. EG1 production and biomass accumulation did not seem to vary when cells were induced at different pH values. Both of EG1 and cell density were found to increase with higher methanol concentrations, reaching 62.48 IU/mL and 31.7 (OD600) respectively after 120 h induction with 2.0% (V/V) methanol compared to 30.24 IU/mL and 17.79 (OD60) with 0.25% methanol induction. EG1 expression was further increased by 6.4 times higher than shaking culture after 95.5 hours induction with methanol in fed-batch fermentation, so totally 34 times higher than that for GS115EG11 was achieved by screening of high Zeocin resistant clone and high cell density fermentation.

In this study the effect of two plant growth regulators (indolacetic acid, IAA and gibberellic acid, GA3) and also Trichoderma harzianum (T8) on the phytopathogen fungus Fusarium oxysporium (F15) was investigated. IAA and GA3 with 15 and 30 ppm concentration have no significant effect on T. harzianum (T8) growth. The biocontrol activity of T. harzianum on F. oxysporum was slightly decreased by the presence of IAA and/or GA3. Addition of 40 ppm of GA3 to the culture medium of F. oxsporum increased polygalacturonase activity about 100%. A strong increasing effect on chitinase activity (60%) by T. harzianum (T8) was observed in the presence of phytopathogenic fungus F. oxysporum, but 40 ppm IAA and/or GA3 decreased about 47% of chitinase activity of T. harzianum. 
11750831	20011226	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Electrophoretic karyotype of the filamentous fungus Penicillium purpurogenum and chromosomal location of several xylanolytic genes.	The electrophoretic karyotype of the filamentous fungus Penicillium purpurogenum has been resolved. Using contour-clamped homogeneous electric field gel electrophoresis, five chromosomal bands were separated, with estimated sizes of 7.1, 5.2, 3.7, 2.9 and 2.3 Mbp, giving a total genome size of 21.2 Mbp. To our knowledge, this is the smallest Penicillium genome determined so far. By Southern blots and using homologous probes, the chromosomal location of five xylanolytic genes from P. purpurogenum was determined: axeI (acetyl xylan esterase I), xynB (endoxylanase B) and abf1 (arabinofuranosidase 1) in chromosome I, xynA (endoxylanase A) in chromosome II, and axeII (acetyl xylan esterase II) in chromosome III. This is the first study where the location of xylanase genes in a Penicillium genome has been established.

Sugarcane bagasse was used as an inexpensive alternative carbon source for production of β-xylanases from Aspergillus terreus. The induction profile showed that the xylanase activity was detected from the 6th day of cultivation period. Two low molecular weight enzymes, named Xyl T1 and Xyl T2 were purified to apparent homogeneity by ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatographies and presented molecular masses of 24.3and 23.60 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE, respectively. Xyl T1 showed highest activity at 50 °C and pH 6.0, while Xyl T2 was most active at 45 °C and pH 5.0. Mass spectrometry analysis of trypsin digested Xyl T1 and Xyl T2 showed two different fingerprinting spectra, indicating that they are distinct enzymes. Both enzymes were specific for xylan as substrate. Xyl T1 was inhibited in greater or lesser degree by phenolic compounds, while Xyl T2 was very resistant to the inhibitory effect of all phenolic compounds tested. The apparent km values of Xyl T2, using birchwood xylan as substrate, decreased in the presence of six phenolic compounds. Both enzymes were inhibited by N-bromosuccinimide and Hg(2+) and activated by Mn(2+). Incubation of Xyl T1 and Xyl T2 with L-cysteine increased their half-lives up to 14 and 24 h at 50 °C, respectively. Atomic force microscopy showed a bimodal size distribution of globular particles for both enzymes, indicating that Xyl T1 is larger than Xyl T2.

FI-Carboxymethylcellulase (cmc1; family 12) is one of the endoglucanases of Aspergillus aculeatus and consists of single polypeptide chain of 221 amino acids. The cmc1 gene was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae niaD300 (niaD-) under promoter 8142. The plasmid pCMG14 carrying the cmc1 gene at PstI site was used as a source of the gene (920 bp) and Aspergillus oryzae was successfully transformed by the plasmid pNAN-cmc1 (harboring cmc1 gene). The plasmid was integrated in Aspergillus oryzae niaD300 genome at niaD locus and the transformed fungus constitutively produced very high amounts of endoglucanases when grown on glucose, maltose, soluble starch and wheat bran.

Alpha-amylase inhibitor (alpha-AI) from kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv Tendergreen) seeds has been purified to homogeneity by heat treatment in acidic medium, ammonium sulphate fractionation, chromatofocusing and gel filtration. Two isoforms, alpha-AI1 and alpha-AI1', of 43 kDa have been isolated which differ from each other by their isoelectric points and neutral sugar contents. The major isoform alpha-AI1 inhibited human and porcine pancreatic alpha-amylases (PPA) but was devoid of activity on alpha-amylases of bacterial or fungal origins. As shown on the Lineweaver-Burk plots, the nature of the inhibition is explained by a mixed non-competitive inhibition mechanism. Alpha-AI1 formed a 1:2 stoichiometric complex with PPA which showed an optimum pH of 4.5 at 30 degrees C. Owing to the low optimum pH found for alpha-AI activity, inhibitor-containing diets such as beans or transgenic plants expressing alpha-AI should be devoid of any harmful effect on human health.

Bacteriol. 87:432-437. 1964.-"Protoplasts" of Staphylococcus aureus were obtained when cells were treated with a fungal N-acetyl-hexosaminidase in hypertonic sucrose solution. The "protoplasts" were sensitive to osmotic shock, and were free of amino sugars and rigid cell walls. They were unable to regenerate cell walls and form colonies. They may be true protoplasts. Osmotic barriers in the "protoplasts" were preserved, and the "protoplasts" incorporated C(14)-l-alanine at about 60% of the rate of intact cells. 
19916911	20091118	Biochemistry_Mosc.	D016428 	Isolation and properties of extracellular beta-xylosidases from fungi Aspergillus japonicus and Trichoderma reesei.	Homogeneous beta-xylosidases with molecular mass values 120 and 80 kDa (as shown by SDS-PAGE), belonging to the third family of glycosyl hydrolases, were isolated by anion-exchange, hydrophobic, and gel-penetrating chromatography from enzyme preparations based on the fungi Aspergillus japonicus and Trichoderma reesei, respectively. The enzymes exhibit maximal activity in acidic media (pH 3.5-4.0), and temperature activity optimum was 70 degrees C for the beta-xylosidase of A. japonicus and 60 degrees C for the beta-xylosidase of T. reesei. Kinetic parameters of p-nitrophenyl beta-xylopyranoside and xylooligosaccharide hydrolysis by the purified enzymes were determined, which showed that beta-xylosidase of A. japonicus was more specific towards low molecular weight substrates, while beta-xylosidase of T. reesei preferred high molecular weight substrates. The competitive type of inhibition by reaction product (xylose) was found for both enzymes. The interaction of the enzymes of different specificity upon hydrolysis of glucurono- and arabinoxylans was found. The beta-xylosidases exhibit synergism with endoxylanase upon hydrolysis of glucuronoxylan as well as with alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase and endoxylanase upon hydrolysis of arabinoxylan. Addition of beta-xylosidases increased efficiency of hydrolysis of plant raw materials with high hemicellulose content (maize cobs) by the enzymic preparation Celloviridine G20x depleted of its own beta-xylosidase.

Aspergillus niger strains, sensitive or resistant to toxic compounds of beet molasses, were the object of the present studies. Between the studied strains differences existed in the cell wall dry mass and wall components content, chitin synthesis, activity of enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis, and in the wall ultrastructure. Higher content of proteins and lipids but lower of glucan and chitin; less or lack of fibrillar components, thinner cell wall as well as lower level of glucanase and chitinase, diminished [3H] glucosamine incorporation into cytoplasm and cell wall characterized the sensitive strains of A. niger. 
15518345	20041103	Mycopathologia	D016428 D013485 	Trichoderma spp. antagonism to the dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum: implications in treatment of onychomycosis.	Onychomycosis--the dermatophytic invasion of the nail--is difficult to eradicate with drug treatment. The hyphae of the main invading pathogen, Trichophyton rubrum, are often interwoven with the nail plate, preventing effective anti-mycotic agents from reaching its growing tips. An alternative approach to treat onychomycosis may possibly be the application of a biological control agent against the pathogen. In analogy with the success of biocontrol of phytopathogenic fungi, we screened a series of commercially available Trichoderma strains for potential antagonism between Trichoderma and Trichophyton spp. A wide spectrum of antagonism capacity, ranging from effective overgrowth to no interaction was found, with Trichoderma virens NRRL 26672 being the most effective against the Trichophyton strains tested e.g. T. rubrum NCPF118. Furthermore, T. virens NRRL 26672 grown with T. rubrum NCPF118 hyphae as a carbon source, exhibited enhanced induced secretion of active extracellular chitinases and beta-glucosidases, affecting lysis and sporulation on T. rubrum NCPF118 hyphae. Growth of Trichod. virens NRRL 26672 in poor medium also resulted in secretion of antibiotics active in arresting the growth of T. rubrum NCPF118 inoculum. Our findings may open new directions for the treatment of onychomycosis, either in combination with known medications or as a new "natural" route.

The egI gene, encoding a major endoglucanase (EGI) of Scopulariopsis brevicaulis TOF-1212, was cloned and sequenced. The eglgene consisted of 868 bp with one intron and encoded a protein of 229 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 22,392 daltons. The EGI was assigned to a family 45 of glycosyl hydrolases and showed high similarity with other fungal endoglucanases, especially with those of Humicola grisea and Fusarium oxysporum, on the basis of hydrophobic cluster analysis. The egI gene was expressed under the promoter of the phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGK) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The transformed cells were able to secrete the enzyme efficiently in an active form.

The ability of triadimefon (TDM), a triazolic fungicide, to alter the biochemical constituents and thereby minimizing the days required for sprouting in white yam (Dioscorea rotundata Poir.) tubers during storage under (30+/-2) degrees C in the dark, was studied. TDM at 20 mg/L was given to tubers by dipping the tubers in treatment solution containing 20 mg/L TDM on 10, 25 and 40 d after storage (DAS). Starch, sugars, protein, amino acid contents as well as protease and alpha-amylase activities were estimated on 15, 30 and 45 DAS from two physiological regions viz., apical and basal regions of the tubers. In normal conditions (control) sprouting occurred on 70 to 80 DAS. The starch content decreased, while protein, amino acid, sugar contents and protease and alpha-amylase activities were increased due to TDM treatment and led to early sprouting.

A cellulose binding domain (CBD) of an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (Ben) from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis BSE616 was replaced with the CBD of exoglucanase I (TexI) from the fungus Trichoderma viride HK-75. The resultant hybrid enzyme Ben'-CBDTexI, comprising the catalytic domain (Ben') of Ben and the CBD (CBDTexI) of TexI, was highly expressed at 20% of the total protein in Escherichia coli. The molecular mass of the hybrid enzyme was estimated to be ca. 38 kDa by SDS-PAGE, which was in good agreement with that calculated from 305 amino acids of Ben and 42 amino acids of CBDTexI. The hybrid enzyme exhibited almost the same activity as that of the original Ben toward soluble substrates, such as cellooligosaccharides. The hybrid enzyme showed higher binding ability and hydrolysis activity toward microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel), even though the length of the CBD of TexI was four times smaller than that of Ben. The hybrid enzyme was more resistant to tryptic digestion than the original Ben. The efficient binding ability of the hybrid enzyme to Avicel permitted purification of the enzyme using an Avicel-affinity column to the extent of ca. 90% purity. 
16621070	20060420	Mol._Biochem._Parasitol.	D016428 D052061 	The cyst wall of Entamoeba invadens contains chitosan (deacetylated chitin).	The cyst wall of Entamoeba invadens (Ei), a model for the human pathogen Entamoeba histolytica, contains chitin, which is a homopolymer of beta-1, 4-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc). In fungi and in bacteria that make nodulation factors, chitin deacetylases make chitosan, which is a mixture of GlcNAc and glucosamine and so has a positive charge. The activity of an Ei chitin deacetylase was revealed by a 3-4-fold increase in released GlcNAc when deproteinated cyst walls were chemically acetylated prior to treatment with a commerical chitinase. Because this chitinase releases GlcNAc but not GlcN, increases in released GlcNAc after acetylation suggested the presence of chitosan in Ei cyst walls. Five putative Ei and Eh chitin deacetylase genes resembled those of fungi and bacteria. A predicted Eh chitin deacetylase matched closely the three-dimensional structure of a Bacillus subtilis peptiodglycan deacetylase. A recombinant Eh chitin deacetylase, expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deacetylated chitooligosaccharides in vitro. These results are consistent with the idea that Ei chitin deacetylases modify chitin to produce chitosan in the Ei cyst wall. 
24161728	20131029	Fungal_Genet._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	The MpkB MAP kinase plays a role in autolysis and conidiation of Aspergillus nidulans.	The mpkB gene of Aspergillus nidulans encodes a MAP kinase homologous to Fus3p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is involved in conjugation process. MpkB is required for completing the sexual development at the anastomosis and post-karyogamy stages. The mpkB deletion strain could produce conidia under the repression condition of conidiation such as sealing and even in the submerged culture concomitant with persistent brlA expression, implying that MpkB might have a role in timely regulation of brlA expression. The submerged culture of the deletion strain showed typical autolytic phenotypes including decrease in dry cell mass (DCM), disorganization of mycelial balls, and fragmentation of hyphae. The chiB, engA and pepJ genes which are encoding cell wall hydrolytic enzymes were transcribed highly in the submerged culture. Also, we observed that the enzyme activity of chitinase and glucanase in the submerged culture of mpkB deletion strain was much higher than that of wild type. The deletion of mpkB also caused a precocious germination of conidia and reduction of spore viability. The expression of the vosA gene, a member of velvet gene family, was not observed in the mpkB deletion strain. These results suggest that MpkB should have multiple roles in germination and viability of conidia, conidiation and autolysis through regulating the expression of vosA and brlA.

An endo-β-1,4-mannanase encoding gene, man5, was cloned from Bispora antennata CBS 126.38, which was isolated from a beech stump. The cDNA of man5 consists of 1,299 base pairs and encodes a 432-amino-acid protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 46.6 kDa. Deduced MAN5 exhibited the highest amino acid sequence identity of 58% to a β-mannanase of glycoside hydrolase family 5 from Aspergillus aculeatus. Recombinant MAN5 was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The specific activity of the final preparation towards locust bean gum was 289 U mg(-1). MAN5 showed optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 70 °C and had good adaptation and stability over a broad range of pH values. The enzyme showed more than 60% of peak activity at pH 3.0-8.0 and retained more than 80% of activity after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in both acid and alkaline conditions (pH 4.0-11.0). The K                         (m) and V                         (max) values were 1.33 mg ml(-1) and 444 μmol min(-1) mg(-1) and 1.17 mg ml(-1) and 196 μmol min(-1) mg(-1) for locust bean gum and konjac flour, respectively. Of all tested metal ions and chemical reagents, Co(2+), Ni(2+), and β-mercaptoethanol enhanced the enzyme activity at 1 mM, whereas other chemicals had no effect on or partially inhibited the enzyme activity. MAN5 was highly resistant to acidic and neutral proteases (trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, collagenase, subtilisin A, and proteinase K). By virtue of the favorable properties of MAN5, it is possible to apply this enzyme in the paper and food industries. 
9311112	19971006	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D016454 	Trehalases and trehalose hydrolysis in fungi.	The simultaneous presence of two different trehalose-hydrolysing activities has been recognised in several fungal species. While these enzymes, known as acid and neutral trehalases, share a strict specificity for trehalose, they are nevertheless rather different in subcellular localisation and in several biochemical and regulatory properties. The function of these apparently redundant activities in the same cell was not completely understood until recently. Biochemical and genetic studies now suggest that these enzymes may have specialised and exclusive roles in fungal cells. It is thought that neutral trehalases mobilise cytosolic trehalose, under the control of developmental programs, chemical and nutrient signals, or stress responses. On the other hand, acid trehalases appear not to mobilise cytosolic trehalose, but to act as 'carbon scavenger' hydrolases enabling cells to utilise exogenous trehalose as a carbon source, under the control of carbon catabolic regulatory circuits. Although much needs to be learned about the molecular identity of trehalases, it seems that in fungi at least one class of acid trehalases evolved independently from the other trehalases.

D016428 D013485 	Functional expression of the Aspergillus flavus PKS-NRPS hybrid CpaA involved in the biosynthesis of cyclopiazonic acid.	alpha-Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) is an indole tetramic acid mycotoxin. Based on our identification of the polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthase (PKS-NRPS) hybrid gene cpaA involved in cyclopiazonic acid biosynthesis in Aspergillus fungi, we carried out heterologous expression of Aspergillus flavuscpaA under alpha-amylase promoter in Aspergillus oryzae and identified its sole product to be the CPA biosynthetic intermediate cyclo-acetoacetyl-l-tryptophan (cAATrp). This result rationalized that the PKS-NRPS hybrid enzyme CpaA catalyzes condensation of the diketide acetoacetyl-ACP formed by the PKS module and l-Trp activated by the NRPS module. This CpaA expression system provides us an ideal platform for PKS-NRPS functional analysis, such as adenylation domain selectivity and product releasing mechanism. 
7765775	19941101	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Growth rate influences MF alpha 1 promoter activity in MAT alpha Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	The signal sequences of the MF alpha 1 prepro alpha-factor gene are frequently used to direct secretion of heterologous proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They are often employed together with the MF alpha 1 promoter in secretion vectors, such that this promoter directs the transcription of many heterologous gene cassettes in yeast. Most of the existing literature indicates that the MF alpha 1 promoter is constitutive in MAT alpha cells, although some data suggests that it may be more active in respiratory or late logarithmic fermentative cultures. To identify whether there is a growth rate or medium control over MF alpha 1 promoter activity a strain was constructed with an integrated MF alpha 1 promoter-beta-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter gene fusion. Intracellular beta-galactosidase of this strain during batch culture on glucose, raffinose and acetate showed that MF alpha 1 promoter activity was higher during respiratory growth on acetate as compared to more rapid fermentative growth on glucose or raffinose, a result that might indicate this activity being inversely related to growth rate. Chemostat culture confirmed that growth rate does indeed influence MF alpha 1 promoter activity in glucose-grown cells, the activity of this promoter increasing 2- to 2.5-fold as dilution (growth) rates were reduced from maximal values to 0.2 h-1, but then decreasing with the further decreases in dilution rate needed for fully respiratory growth. Thus a promoter generally thought to be constitutive in MAT alpha cells is nevertheless subject to a complex growth rate control. 
24033867	20130917	Plant_J.	D016428 D013485 	A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination.	Seed germination and innate immunity both have significant effects on plant life spans because they control the plant's entry into the ecosystem and provide defenses against various external stresses, respectively. Much ecological evidence has shown that seeds with high vigor are generally more tolerant of various environmental stimuli in the field than those with low vigor. However, there is little genetic evidence linking germination and immunity in plants. Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity. We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of α-amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination. Moreover, it also inhibits the expression of defense genes, and so reduces the resistance of rice plants to fungal and bacterial pathogens as well as herbivorous insects. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OslecRK interacts with an actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) in vivo via its kinase domain. Moreover, the rice adf mutant exhibited a reduced seed germination rate due to the suppression of α-amylase gene expression. This mutant also exhibited depressed immune responses and reduced resistance to biotic stresses. Our results thus provide direct genetic evidence for a common physiological pathway connecting germination and immunity in plants. They also partially explain the common observation that high-vigor seeds often perform well in the field. The dual effects of OslecRK may be indicative of progressive adaptive evolution in rice.  
16410763	20060118	J._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Degradation of crystalline cellulose by the brown-rot basidiomycete Fomitopsis palustris.	This study demonstrated that the brown rot basidiomycete Fomitopsis palustris was able to degrade crystalline cellulose (Avicel). This fungus could also produce the three major cellulases (exoglucanases, endoglucanases, and beta-glucosidase) when the cells were grown on 2.0% Avicel. Avicel degraded by F. palustris showed a decrease in relative crystallinity from 83% to 78.5% after 14 days of incubation. The characterization study indicated that optimum pH was 4.5 and optimum temperature was 70 degrees C for exoglucanase (cellobiohydrolase) activity. Hydrolysis of Avicel by the crude enzyme from F. palustris yielded 1.6 mg/ml of glucose after 43 h, which corresponded to a cellulose conversion degree of 3.2%. Therefore, this study revealed for the first time that the brown rot basidiomycete F. palustris produces cellulases capable of yielding soluble sugars from crystalline cellulose. 
2789162	19890630	Gene	D016428 D013485 	Aspergillus oryzae has two nearly identical Taka-amylase genes, each containing eight introns.	cDNA and genomic DNA for two nearly identical genes, AmyI and AmyII, coding for the enzyme Taka-amylase A (TA-A) of the fungus Aspergillus oryzae have been cloned and characterized. These genes are apparently unlinked, differing by only 3 nucleotides (nt) out of the 2720 nt that span the coding regions. The 617-nt 5'-flanking regions differ only at nt -372 (T or A) from the putative ATG start codon and contain four sets of short, inverted repeats (IR) upstream from the putative TATAAA box at nt -100 and the transcription start point at nt -69. The coding regions consist of 499 codons disrupted by eight intervening sequences. The putative proenzymes differ by only two amino acids (aa) and consist of the 478-aa extracellular enzyme plus a 21-aa hydrophobic leader sequence. Except for the replacement site changes in codons 35 (Arg----Gln) and 151 (Phe----Leu), the identity of the two genes continues downstream for 58 nt past the TGA stop codon before diverging. Exon 9 codes for 94 of the 98 aa of the domain B of mature TA-A. Little conservation of TA-A exons was found when these exons were aligned with those of human amylase. The genes are flanked by at least 6 to 10 kb of unrelated chromosomal nucleotide sequence. The Amy genes are co-expressed, since mRNA (cDNA) specific to the 3'-UTR of both genes was recovered from mycelia grown on starch, a known inducer of TA-A biosynthesis. The 3'-UTRs of cDNAs related to AmyI are shorter (128 nt and 145 nt) than those of AmyII (179 nt and 297 nt). The AmyI specific 3'-UTR is characterized by the absence of IR sequences and the presence of a putative 'AATAAA' polyadenylation signal.

A strain of thermophilic fungus, Thermoascus aurantiacus, was isolated from local soil. From the culture filtrates of the organism grown on blotting paper, a xylanase, beta-glucosidase, exocellulase, and endocellulase were obtained in large amounts in highly purified form by employing ion-exchange and gel-permeation chromatography.

A 44-kDa 1,3-beta-glucanase was purified from the culture medium of a Paenibacillus strain with a 28-fold increase in specific activity with 31% recovery. The purified enzyme preferentially catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucans with 1,3-beta-linkage and has an endolytic mode of action. The enzyme also showed binding activity to various insoluble polysaccharides including unhydrolyzable substrates such as xylan and cellulose. The antifungal activity of this Paenibacillus enzyme and a previously purified 1,3-beta-glucanase from Streptomyces sioyaensis were examined in this study. Both enzymes had the ability to damage the cell-wall structures of the growing mycelia of phytopathogenic fungi Pythium aphanidermatum and Rhizoctonic solani AG-4. Nonetheless, the Paenibacillus enzyme had a much stronger effect on inhibiting the growth of fungi tested. 
1547940	19920301	Genes_Dev.	D016428 	Stable nucleosome positioning and complete repression by the yeast alpha 2 repressor are disrupted by amino-terminal mutations in histone H4.	Nucleosomes are positioned in the presence of the yeast repressor alpha 2 in minichromosomes containing the alpha 2 operator and on the promoters of a-cell-specific genes regulated by alpha 2. To investigate the possibility that alpha 2 directs nucleosome position through an interaction with a component of the core particle, we analyzed chromatin structures adjacent to the operator in alpha cells containing mutations in the amino-terminal region of histone H4. Deletion or point mutation of specific amino acids in histone H4 altered the location and/or stability of nucleosomes adjacent to the alpha 2 operator. These changes in chromatin structure were accompanied by partial derepression of a beta-galactosidase reporter construct under alpha 2 control, even though alpha 2 remained bound to its operator sequence. Our data suggest that complete repression by alpha 2 requires stable positioning of nucleosomes in promoter regions and this positioning involves the conserved amino-terminal region of histone H4.

Filamentous fungi are widely used for the production of homologous and heterologous proteins. Recently, there has been increasing interest in Aspergillus oryzae because of its ability to produce heterologous proteins in solid-state culture. To provide an overview of protein secretion by A. oryzae in solid-state culture, we carried out a comparative proteome analysis of extracellular proteins in solid-state and submerged (liquid) cultures. Extracellular proteins prepared from both cultures sequentially from 0 to 40 h were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, and protein spots at 40 h were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We also attempted to identify cell wall-bound proteins of the submerged culture. We analyzed 85 spots from the solid-state culture and 110 spots from the submerged culture. We identified a total of 29 proteins, which were classified into 4 groups. Group 1 consisted of extracellular proteins specifically produced in the solid-state growth condition, such as glucoamylase B and alanyl dipeptidyl peptidase. Group 2 consisted of extracellular proteins specifically produced in the submerged condition, such as glucoamylase A (GlaA) and xylanase G2 (XynG2). Group 3 consisted of proteins produced in both conditions, such as xylanase G1. Group 4 consisted of proteins that were secreted to the medium in the solid-state growth condition but trapped in the cell wall in the submerged condition, such as alpha-amylase (TAA) and beta-glucosidase (Bgl). A Northern analysis of seven genes from the four groups suggested that the secretion of TAA and Bgl was regulated by trapping these proteins in the cell wall in submerged culture and that secretion of GlaA and XynG2 was regulated at the posttranscriptional level in the solid-state culture. 
20978986	20101028	Methods_Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	A multi-step chromatographic strategy to purify three fungal endo-β-glucanases.	Fungi and fungal enzymes have traditionally occupied a central role in biotechnology. Understanding the biochemical properties of the variety of enzymes produced by these eukaryotes has been an area of research interest for decades and again more recently due to global interest in greener bio-production technologies. Purification of an individual enzyme allows its unique biochemical and functional properties to be determined, can provide key information as to the role of individual biocatalysts within a complex enzyme system, and can inform both protein engineering and enzyme production strategies in the development of novel green technologies based on fungal biocatalysts. Many enzymes of current biotechnological interest are secreted by fungi into the extracellular culture medium. These crude enzyme mixtures are typically complex, multi-component, and generally also contain other non-enzymatic proteins and secondary metabolites. In this chapter, we describe a multi-step chromatographic strategy required to isolate three new endo-β-glucanases (denoted EG V, EG VI, and EG VII) with activity against cereal mixed-linkage β-glucans from the thermophilic fungus Talaromyces emersonii. This work also illustrates the challenges frequently involved in isolating individual extracellular fungal proteins in general.

D016428 D013485 	Use of pectinases complexed to colloidal gold for the ultrastructural localization of polygalacturonic acids in the cell walls of the fungus Ascocalyx abietina.	Three pectinase--gold complexes were used to localize polygalacturonic acids in the fungus Ascocalyx abietina (Lagerberg) Schlaepfer-Bernhard. With the pectinesterase and pectin lyase--gold complexes, the labelling was uniformly distributed over the fungus walls and did not seem to be significantly influenced by the tissue preparation. With the polygalacturonase--gold complex, differences in the labelling distribution were noted according to the fixation procedure indicating, therefore, that osmication of the tissues could greatly interfere with the localization of the specific enzyme binding sites. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the possibility of detecting polygalacturonic acids by means of different gold-complexed pectinases.

A white rot fungus, identified as Armillaria gemina SKU2114 on the basis of morphological and phylogenetic analyses, was found to secrete efficient lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. The strain showed maximum endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase, and β-glucosidase activities of 146, 34, and 15 U/mL, respectively, and also secreted xylanase, laccase, mannanase, and lignin peroxidase with activities of 1270, 0.16, 57, and 0.31 U/mL, respectively, when grown with rice straw as a carbon source. Among various plant biomasses tested for saccharification, aspen biomass produced the maximum amount of reducing sugar. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the hydrolysis of aspen biomass to achieve the highest level of sugar production. A maximum saccharification yield of 62% (429 mg/g-substrate) was obtained using Populus tomentiglandulosa biomass after 48 h of hydrolysis. A. gemina was shown to be a good option for use in the production of reducing sugars from lignocellulosic biomass. 
3058330	19880901	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	MAL63 codes for a positive regulator of maltose fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Genetic analysis of the MAL6 locus has previously yielded mal6 mutants which fall into a single complementation group and which are noninducible for maltase and maltose permease. However, the strains used in these studies contained additional partially functional copies of MAL1 (referred to as MAL1g) and MAL3 (referred to as MAL3g). Using a strain lacking MALg genes, we have isolated two classes of mutants and these classes correspond to mutations in MAL63 and MAL61, two genes of the MAL6 complex. Disruptions of MAL63 are noninducible for maltase and maltose permease and for their corresponding mRNAs. The mal6 mutants are shown to map to MAL63. Inducer exclusion as a cause of the noninducible phenotype of the mal63 mutations has been eliminated by constructing a mal63 mutant in a strain constitutive for maltose permease; the strain remains noninducible. These results rigorously demonstrate that MAL63 is a regulatory gene which plays a positive role in the regulation of maltose fermentation. 
23053575	20121012	Mycorrhiza	D016428 D013485 	Activity of native hydrolytic enzymes and their association with the cell wall of three ectomycorrhizal fungi.	The ecological and biogeochemical relevance of hydrolytic enzymes associated with the fungal cell wall has been poorly studied in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. We used a modified sequential extraction procedure to investigate the activity of various hydrolytic enzymes (β-glucosidase, acid-phosphatase, leucine-aminopeptidase, chitinase, xylanase and glucuronidase) and their association with the cell wall of three ECM fungi (Rhizopogon roseolus, Paxillus involutus and Piloderma croceum). Fungi were grown on C-rich solid medium under three different P concentrations (3.7, 0.37 and 0.037 mM). The sequential extraction procedure classifies enzymes as: (a) cytosolic, (b) loosely bound, (c) hydrophobically bound, (d) ionically bound and (e) covalently bound. Results showed that for the same fungus absolute enzymatic activity was affected by P concentration, whilst enzymatic compartmentalization among the cytosol and the cell wall fractions was not. The association of enzymes with the cell wall was fungus- and enzyme-specific. Our data indicate also that enzymes best known for being either extracellular or cytosolic or both, do act in muro as well. The ecological implications of cell wall-bound enzymes and the potential applications and limitations of sequential extractions are further discussed. 
23220961	20121211	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Microbial mechanisms mediating increased soil C storage under elevated atmospheric N deposition.	Future rates of anthropogenic N deposition can slow the cycling and enhance the storage of C in forest ecosystems. In a northern hardwood forest ecosystem, experimental N deposition has decreased the extent of forest floor decay, leading to increased soil C storage. To better understand the microbial mechanisms mediating this response, we examined the functional genes derived from communities of actinobacteria and fungi present in the forest floor using GeoChip 4.0, a high-throughput functional-gene microarray. The compositions of functional genes derived from actinobacterial and fungal communities was significantly altered by experimental nitrogen deposition, with more heterogeneity detected in both groups. Experimental N deposition significantly decreased the richness and diversity of genes involved in the depolymerization of starch (∼12%), hemicellulose (∼16%), cellulose (∼16%), chitin (∼15%), and lignin (∼16%). The decrease in richness occurred across all taxonomic groupings detected by the microarray. The compositions of genes encoding oxidoreductases, which plausibly mediate lignin decay, were responsible for much of the observed dissimilarity between actinobacterial communities under ambient and experimental N deposition. This shift in composition and decrease in richness and diversity of genes encoding enzymes that mediate the decay process has occurred in parallel with a reduction in the extent of decay and accumulation of soil organic matter. Our observations indicate that compositional changes in actinobacterial and fungal communities elicited by experimental N deposition have functional implications for the cycling and storage of carbon in forest ecosystems. 
8572696	19960101	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 	Adsorption characteristics of cellulolytic enzymes from the anaerobic fungus Piromyces sp. strain E2 on microcrystalline cellulose.	Characteristics of the cellulolytic system of the anaerobic fungus Piromyces sp. strain E2 with respect to adsorption onto microcrystalline cellulose were examined. Cellulolytic enzymes were separated by gel filtration chromatography into a high-molecular-mass complex with an apparent mass of approximately 1,200 to 1,400 kDa and proteins of lower molecular weights. Adsorption of cellulolytic enzymes was not only very fast (within 2 min, equilibrium was attained) but also very effective: Avicelase, endoglucanase, and beta-glucosidase activities from the high-molecular-mass complex were almost completely removed by Avicel. Adsorption of these enzyme activities was proportional and appeared to obey the Langmuir isotherm. For Avicelase, endoglucanase, and beta-glucosidase activities, the maximum amounts adsorbed (Amax) and apparent adsorption constants (Kad) were 16.8, 600, and 33.5 IU/g and 284, 6.93 and 126 ml/IU, respectively. The results of this study strongly support the existence of a multiprotein enzyme complex. This complex was found not to be specifically associated with cell wall fragments as judged by chitin determination. 
23397242	20130212	J._Mol._Evol.	D016428 D013485 	Evolutionary history of eukaryotic α-glucosidases from the α-amylase family.	Although some α-glucosidases from the α-amylase family (glycoside hydrolase family GH13) have been studied extensively, their exact number, organization on the chromosome, and orthology/paralogy relationship were unknown. This was true even for important disease vectors where gut α-glucosidase is known to be receptor for the Bin toxin used to control the population of some mosquito species. In some cases orthologs from related species were studied intensively, while potentially important paralogs were omitted. We have, therefore, used a bioinformatics approach to identify all family GH13 α-glucosidases from the selected species from Metazoa (including three mosquito species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex quinquefasciatus) as well as from Fungi in an effort to characterize their arrangement on the chromosome and evolutionary relationships among orthologs and among paralogs. We also searched for pseudogenes and genes coding for enzymatically inactive proteins with a possible new function. We have found GH13 α-glucosidases mostly in Arthropoda and Fungi where they form gene families, as a result of multiple lineage-specific gene duplications. In mosquito species we have identified 14 α-glucosidase (Aglu) genes of which only five have been biochemically characterized so far, two are putative pseudogenes and the rest remains uncharacterized. We also revealed quite a complex evolutionary history of the eukaryotic α-glucosidases probably involving multiple losses of genes or horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. 
11223945	20010227	Yeast	D016428 D013485 	Subtelomeric sequence from the right arm of Schizosaccharomyces pombe chromosome I contains seven permease genes.	The sequence has been determined of 80 888 bp of contiguous subtelomeric DNA, including the isp5 gene, from the right arm of chromosome I of Schizosaccharomyces pombe; 27 open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 100 codons are present, giving a density of one gene per 3.0 kb. Seven of the predicted proteins are members of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transport proteins, including four amino acid permease homologues, bringing this family of amino acid permease sequences to 17 in Sz. pombe, and a phylogenetic analysis is presented. Also encoded is an allantoate permease homologue, a sulphate permease homologue and a probable urea active transporter. Predicted non-membrane proteins include a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACC deaminase), a class III aminotransferase, serine acetyltransferase, protein-L-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase, alpha-glucosidase, alpha-galactosidase, esterase/lipase, oxidoreductase of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, aldehyde dehydrogenase, formamidase, amidase, flavohaemoprotein, a putative translation initiation inhibitor and a protein with similarity to a filamentous fungal conidiation-specific protein. The remaining six ORFs are likely to encode proteins, either because they have sequence similarity with hypothetical proteins or because they are known to be transcribed. Introns are scarce in the sequenced region: only three ORFs contain introns, with only one having multiple introns. The sequenced region also contains a single Tf1 transposon long terminal repeat (LTR). The sequence is derived from cosmid clones c869, c922 and c1039 and has been submitted to the EMBL database under entries SPAC869 (Accession No. AL132779), SPAC922 (AL133522) and SPAC1039 (AL133521). 
17838811	19890908	Science	D016428 	A chitin-binding lectin from stinging nettle rhizomes with antifungal properties.	Rhizomes of stinging nettle contain a small-sized lectin that exhibits binding specificity toward chitin. This lectin inhibits growth of several phytopathogenic and saprophytic chitin-containing fungi in vitro. The antifungal action of the nettle lectin differs from the action of chitinases, which are a ubiquitous class of antifungal plant proteins. Moreover, the nettle lectin acts synergistically with chitinase in inhibiting fungal growth. The nettle lectin may be a promising candidate for possible applications in the genetic engineering of disease-resistant crops.

D023362 D016428 D013485 	Amino acid supplementation, controlled oxygen limitation and sequential double induction improves heterologous xylanase production by Pichia stipitis.	Heterologous endo-beta-1,4-xylanase was produced by Pichia stipitis under control of the hypoxia-inducible PsADH2-promoter in a high-cell-density culture. After promoter induction by a shift to oxygen limitation, different aeration rates (oxygen transfer rates) were applied while maintaining oxygen-limitation. Initially, enzyme production was higher in oxygen-limited cultures with high rates of oxygen transfer, although the maximum xylanase activity was not significantly influenced. Amino acid supplementation increased the production of the heterologous endo-beta-1,4-xylanase significantly in highly aerated oxygen-limited cultures, until glucose was depleted. A slight second induction of the promoter was observed in all cultures after the glucose had been consumed. The second induction was most obvious in amino acid-supplemented cultures with higher oxygen transfer rates during oxygen limitation. When such oxygen-limited cultures were shifted back to fully aerobic conditions, a significant re-induction of heterologous endo-beta-1,4-xylanase production was observed. Re-induction was accompanied by ethanol consumption. A similar protein production pattern was observed when cultures were first grown on ethanol as sole carbon source and subsequently glucose and oxygen limitation were applied. Thus, we present the first expression system in yeast with a sequential double-inducible promoter. 
11277626	20010330	Fungal_Genet._Biol.	D016428 D013485 	A study of the protein secretory pathway of Aspergillus niger using a glucoamylase-GFP fusion protein.	The effect of various treatments that block protein secretion was visualized in Aspergillus niger using a strain expressing a glucoamylase-GFP fusion protein. Cold shock caused the retention of the fusion protein in a reticulate network (ER) with brighter nodes that may represent Golgi bodies. Treatment of germlings with brefeldin A (BFA) also initially caused accumulation within the ER but prolonged exposure led to the formation and targeting of the fusion protein to vacuoles from the ER. Disruption of actin with cytochalasin A initially led to a faint diffuse accumulation and ultimately to the formation of aggregated bodies which were not vacuoles, suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton is important in secretory vesicle transport. Disruption of microtubules with nocodazole led to hyperbranching but did not cause intracellular accumulation, suggesting that microtubules play a role in directing vesicle transport rather than vesicle movement per se. Treatment of regenerating protoplasts confirmed that BFA and cytochalasin but not nocodazole inhibited protein secretion. When germlings were subjected to carbon starvation, vacuolation was rapidly initiated throughout the hyphae and GFP fluorescence was visible in some of the vacuoles, indicating retargeting of the fusion protein from the secretory pathway to the vacuoles. 
3929028	19850101	Microbios	D003160 D016428 	Growth of bacteria on chitin, fungal cell walls and fungal biomass, and the effect of extracellular enzymes produced by these cultures on the antifungal activity of amphotericin B.	Vibrio alginolyticus, Streptomyces griseus, Arthrobacter G12, Bacillus sp. and Cytophaga sp. were grown on solid and liquid media containing soluble and insoluble carbon sources. Arthrobacter G12, Bacillus sp. and Cytophaga sp. grew well on media which contained fungal cell walls or fungal biomass as the main carbon source. All bacteria produced extracellular proteases and all bacteria except Arthrobacter G12 produced extracellular chitinases. Growth of Cytophaga sp. on colloidal chitin was paralleled by the accumulated chitinase activity in the culture filtrate, and growth of Cytophaga sp. and Arthrobacter G12 on cell walls of Geotrichum candidum and cell walls of Candida pseudotropicalis was paralleled by the accumulation of laminarinase activity in the culture filtrate, but little or no extracellular chitinase activity was observed in these cultures. Mycolases purified from the culture filtrates of Cytophaga sp. grown on colloidal chitin on cell walls of C. pseudotropicalis potentiated the antifungal activity of amphotericin B. 
22192075	20111224	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 	Human chitotriosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of chitosan.	Chitotriosidase (HCHT) is one of two family 18 chitinases produced by humans, the other being acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase). The enzyme is thought to be part of the human defense mechanism against fungal parasites, but its precise role and the details of its enzymatic properties have not yet been fully unraveled. We have studied the properties of HCHT by analyzing how the enzyme acts on high-molecular weight chitosans, soluble copolymers of β-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc, A), and glucosamine (GlcN, D). Using methods for in-depth studies of the chitinolytic machinery of bacterial family 18 enzymes, we show that HCHT degrades chitosan primarily via an endoprocessive mechanism, as would be expected on the basis of the structural features of its substrate-binding cleft. The preferences of HCHT subsites for acetylated versus nonacetylated sugars were assessed by sequence analysis of obtained oligomeric products showing a very strong, absolute, and a relative weak preference for an acetylated unit in the -2, -1, and +1 subsites, respectively. The latter information is important for the design of inhibitors that are specific for the human chitinases and also provides insight into what kind of products may be formed in vivo upon administration of chitosan-containing medicines or food products.

Biological sources for the control of plant pathogenic fungi remain an important objective for sustainable agricultural practices. Actinomycetes are used extensively in the pharmaceutical industry and agriculture owing to their great diversity in enzyme production. In the present study, therefore, we evaluated chitinase production by endophytic actinomycetes and the potential of this for control of phytopathogenic fungi. Endophytic Streptomyces were grown on minimum medium supplemented with chitin, and chitinase production was quantified. The strains were screened for any activity towards phytopathogenic fungi and oomycetes by a dual-culture in vitro assay. The correlation between chitinase production and pathogen inhibition was calculated and further confirmed on Colletotrichum sublineolum cell walls by scanning electron microscopy. This paper reports a genetic correlation between chitinase production and the biocontrol potential of endophytic actinomycetes in an antagonistic interaction with different phytopathogens, suggesting that this control could occur inside the host plant. A genetic correlation between chitinase production and pathogen inhibition was demonstrated. Our results provide an enhanced understanding of endophytic Streptomyces and its potential as a biocontrol agent. The implications and applications of these data for biocontrol are discussed.

Most fungal cellulases are found in multiple forms varying in size and substrate specificity. Aspergillus aculeatus is known to produce nine cellulolytic enzymes including an endoglucanase (FI CM-cellulase, M(r) = 24,002) as the major component. Single crystals of FI CM-cellulase from Aspergillus aculeatus have been prepared by sitting-drop vapour diffusion using ammonium sulphate as a precipitant. The cellulase crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a = 52.79(2) A, b = 106.40(4) A and c = 33.15(1) A. The crystals contain one enzyme molecule per asymmetric unit. They diffract to at least 2.0 A resolution and are very stable against X-ray irradiation.

A novel procedure was used to purify a cytosolic chitinase from Candida albicans to electrophoretic homogeneity. The results represent the first demonstration of the purification of a fungal intracellular chitinase using the criterion of a single band detected following silver-staining of a polyacrylamide gel run under denaturing conditions. Purified chitinase had pH and temperature optima of 5.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. Inhibition of enzyme activity by allosamidin was pH-dependent occurring maximally at pH 8.0. Phospholipids had similar marked and highly specific effects on the activities of both the purified soluble enzyme and a solubilized microsomal chitinase from C. albicans. Evidence is provided for the existence of a complex chitinolytic system in this organism.

To improve the digestibility of paddy straw to be used as animal feed by means of selective delignification using white rot fungi. Solid state fermentation of paddy straw was carried out with some white rot fungi for 60 days. Different biochemical analyses, e.g. total organic matter (TOM) loss, hemicellulose loss, cellulose loss, lignin loss and in vitro digestibility, were carried out along with laccase, xylanase and carboxymethyl cellulase activity. The results were compared with that of a widely studied fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which degraded 464 g kg(-1) TOM and enhanced the in vitro digestibility from 185 to 254 g kg(-1) after 60 days of incubation. Straw inoculated with Phlebia brevispora possessed maximum crude protein. All the tested white rot fungi efficiently degraded the lignin and enhanced the in vitro digestibility of paddy straw. Phlebia brevispora, Phlebia radiata and P. chrysosporium enhanced the in vitro digestibility almost to similar levels, while the loss in TOM was much lesser in P. brevispora and P. radiata when compared to P. chrysosporium. The study reflects the potential of P. brevispora and P. radiata as suitable choices for practical use in terms of availability of organic matter with higher protein value, selective ligninolysis and better digestibility.

Numerous protein engineering studies have focused on increasing the thermostability of fungal cellulases to improve production of fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic feedstocks. However, the engineered enzymes still undergo thermal inactivation at temperatures well below the inactivation temperatures of hyperthermophilic cellulases. In this report, we investigated the role of free cysteines in the thermal inactivation of wild-type and engineered fungal family 6 cellobiohydrolases (Cel6A). The mechanism of thermal inactivation of Cel6A is consistent with disulfide bond degradation and thiol-disulfide exchange. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that a thermostable variant lacking free cysteines refolds to a native-like structure and retains activity after heat treatment over the pH range 5-9. Whereas conserved disulfide bonds are essential for retaining activity after heat treatment, free cysteines contribute to irreversible thermal inactivation in engineered thermostable Cel6A as well as Cel6A from Hypocrea jecorina and Humicola insolens.

Talaromyces macrosporus forms ascospores that survive pasteurization treatments. Ascospores were dense (1.3 g ml(-1)), relatively dry [0.6 g H(2)O (g dry weight)(-1)] and packed with trehalose (9-17% fresh weight). Trehalose was degraded to glucose monomers between 30 and 100 min after heat activation of the spores. The maximal activity of trehalase was calculated as 400-520 nmol glucose formed min(-1) (mg protein)(-1) as judged by measurements of the trehalose content of spores during germination. During early germination, glucose was released from the cell (10% of the cell weight or more). The intracellular concentration of glucose only peaked briefly. After 160-200 min, the protoplast encompassed by the inner cell wall was ejected through the outer cell wall in a very quick process. Subsequently, respiration of spores increased strongly. The data suggested that trehalose is primarily present for the protection of cell components as glucose is released from the cell. Then, an impenetrable outer cell wall is shed before metabolic activity increases.

Low pectinase production by Aspergillus carbonarius growing on wheat bran solid substrate was found to be due to reduced colonizational ability of the fungus. Since A. niger showed higher growth rates on wheat bran, strain improvement to obtain higher pectinase production in solid state was carried out by inter-specific fusion of protoplasts of A. carbonarius and A. niger. One of the mutants selected for higher activities of alpha-glucosidase showed improved growth rates on wheat bran solid substrate together with increased pectinase production. Size similarities of amplified polymorphic DNA of the mutant with the two parents and identification of a 66 kDa polygalacturonase specific to A. niger suggested genetic recombination in the mutant.

During Dictyostelium discoideum spore germination, degradation of the cellulose-containing spore wall is required to allow the amoeba to emerge. The CelA gene, which is transcribed and expressed exclusively during spore germination, codes for a 705-amino-acid protein that has cellulase activity [endo-(1,4)-beta-D-glucanase]. Amoebae transformed by a vector containing the CelA coding sequence or portions of it transcribed from a heterologous promoter expressed and secreted full-length or suitably truncated proteins during vegetative growth when, under normal conditions, these proteins are not made. The gene constructs divided the CelA protein into three domains: a 461-amino-acid N-terminal region that has significant similarity to those of other cellulases and that has been shown to be the catalytic domain; a contiguous 91-residue repeat containing the motif threonine-glutamic acid-threonine-proline, which is glycosylated; and, joined to the repeat, a C-terminal 153-amino-acid sequence that most probably defines a cellulose-binding domain. 
15729394	20050225	Genome	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Induction of wheat defense and stress-related genes in response to Fusarium graminearum.	Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by species of the fungus Fusarium, is a worldwide disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The Chinese T. aestivum 'Ning7840' is one of few wheat cultivars with resistance to FHB. To identify differentially expressed genes corresponding to FHB resistance, a cDNA library was constructed using pooled mRNA isolated from glumes of 'Ning7840' harvested at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 72, and 96 h after inoculation (hai) with a conidia spore suspension of Fusarium graminearum. Suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA subtraction was carried out using pooled glume mRNAs from the tester and the control. The cDNA library was differentially screened using the forward subtracted cDNAs and the reverse subtracted cDNAs as probes. Twenty-four clones with significant matches to either plant (16 sequences) or fungal (8 sequences) genes were isolated based on their specific hybridization with forward subtracted cDNA and not reverse subtracted cDNA. Six putative defense-related genes were confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Many-fold higher induction of three clones (A3F8, B10H1, and B11H3) in the resistant genotypes compared with susceptible genotypes indicates a putative role in the resistance response to Fusarium graminearum. Transcript accumulations of P450, chitinase (Chi1), and one unknown gene (clone B8Q9) in both resistant and susceptible genotypes suggest an involvement in a generalized resistance response to F. graminearum. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that cDNA clone A4C6 encodes a cytochrome P450 gene (CYP709C3v2), including 14 N-terminal amino acids that have a membrane-associated helical motif. Other domains characteristic of eukaryotic P450 are also present in CYP709C3v2. The deduced polypeptide of cDNA clone B2H2 encodes an acidic isoform of class I chitinase containing a 960-bp coding region. Southern hybridization using aneuploid lines of T. aestivum 'Chinese Spring' indicated that CYP709C3v2 was located on the short arm of chromosomes 2B and 2D.

A rapid method for preparing cell-free extracts of Aspergillus ochraceus was developed.  Mycelial mats were prefrozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder in a cold mortar, and homogenized in an all-glass mechanical homogenizer.  This method provided preparations averaging 43.0 mg of protein per g of mycelium (wet weight).  The method was fast, efficient, and did not subject the extract to temperatures above 1 C or to heavy metals.  The preparation method was suitable for studying a variety of in vitro fungal enzyme systems.  Amylase, acid phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, beta fructofuranosidase, and trehalase activities were measurable in the preparations.

Brazil is a major producer of agro-industrial residues, such as sugarcane bagasse, which could be used as raw material for microbial production of cellulases as an important strategy for the development of sustainable processes of second generation ethanol production. For this purpose, this work aimed at screening for glycosyl hydrolase activities of fungal strains isolated from the Brazilian Cerrado. Among 13 isolates, a Trichoderma harzianum strain (L04) was identified as a promising candidate for cellulase production when cultured on in natura sugarcane bagasse. Strain L04 revealed a well-balanced cellulolytic complex, presenting fast kinetic production of endoglucanases, exoglucanases and β-glucosidases, achieving 4,022, U.L(-1) (72 h), 1,228 U.L(-1) (120 h) and 1,968 U.L(-1) (48 h) as the highest activities, respectively. About 60% glucose yields were obtained from sugarcane bagasse after 18 hours hydrolysis. This new strain represents a potential candidate for on-site enzyme production using sugarcane bagasse as carbon source.
